# Program Design

 - Most existing recommendations from practitioners tend to align in principle on a key aspect of positive outcomes for children being empowering staff at CCIs. 
	- Ensuring staff are positive role models:
		- Factors important here, based on experiences of organizations such as Aangan and Miracle Foundation would be accessibility of staff, quality of the interactions, availability of information to staff and children, orientation for the relationship and a shift to a positive approach to disciplinary action.
		 - Having pre-scheduled interaction points between CCI staff and children to ensure positive role model building.
		 - Staff retention being key to ensuring a feeling of permanence or home-likeness to CCIs.
		 - Staff to child ratio being important towards being able to provide individualized care
		 - Clear SoPs and plans to deal with physical/sexual abuse between peers as well as by staff. 
		 -  Importance of maintaining a regular daily routine, minimizing negative responses to deviations from expected child behavior, and maximizing child safety.
		 - Ensuring safety, choice, collaboration, trust building and individual empowerment among children to ensure care is trauma informed


- During the design of the CAP product itself, keenly observing practices in related spaces like ed-tech, elite hostels and boarding schools, pediatric Hospital Wards and sporting academies might be key to ensuring that this product is not re-inventing the wheel. Even more so because the childcare space hasn't caught up to the innovations in these other fields.
