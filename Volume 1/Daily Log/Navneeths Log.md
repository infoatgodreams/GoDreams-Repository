# Feb 2022 Summary
- As of today we have identified 16 different areas of interest for the Care Standards Framework
	- Caregiving standards
	- Child Safety
	- Education & Play
	- Physical Health
	- Nutrition
	- Care Manual & SoPs
	- Aftercare
	- Restoration
	- Child Development
	- Mental Health
	- Finance & Compliance
	- Leadership & Org Transformation
	- HR Systems & Training
	- Govt Schemes and Acts
	- Alternative Care
	- Diversity & Inclusion
- We have dived deep into Nutrition and Child Safety, looking at what the current realities are for CCIs and attempting to identify key levers for our program.
-  The questions we have begun asking ourselves through the readings are: 
	- What don't we know about how CCIs in India operate? What do we still not know post literature review?
	- What have others done already that we can learn from? (Identifying innovations in institutional care and otherwise)
	- What are considered the gold standards (best practices, high quality inputs, outcome measurements) in institutional childcare?
	- What are the current realities (gaps observed in institutional care, how are these measured?)
- Through asking these questions, we are preparing to immerse in our sandbox CCIs and validate what the literature review has told us and hasn't told us. 

## Nutrition
- Some of the key points that emerged from the literature review could be categorized into:
	 - Nutritional inputs influenced by cultural aspects and belief systems
	 - Children's Individual Experiences with Food
	 - Market supply chain and food prices
	 - Overlaps between heath outcomes and nutritional inputs
	 - Skill level of care and cooking staff
	 - Processes for food preparation and mealtimes
	 - Nutritional inputs influenced by donor/sponsor behavior
- Some of the highlights were:
	- SoPs: SoPs for kitchen management and food supply chain from the market to the table can be contextualized from high quality soup kitchens, hostels and school cafeteria systems. These would include aspects like proper storage hygiene and temperatures, streamlining of the preparation process, standardized recipes and purchase lists for max. cost efficiency, regular variations in menu and integration of individual needs of children
	- Eating Behaviors: A lot of the eating behaviors of children were influenced by the mealtime environment. Not being able to ask for second helpings meant children not knowing how to self regulate quantity of food/knowing satiety. Not having conversations with caregivers around the "dinner table" , leading to caregivers minimum influence on eating behaviors and inability to identify eating disorders early. 
	- Individual Nutrition Plan : This will have to be a part of the Individual Care Plan for each child, ensuring that food disorders, health issues, diet preferences, religious and cultural aspects are all taken into account at the CCI. 
	- Measurement Tools: 
		- While macro measurement tools for malnourishment are available from the WHO and Indian Pediatrics Association that seek to identify stunting and under-weight children , what are quick signs and tells that CCI staff can look for, towards early identification of issues? 
		- While standard frameworks can be used to identify malnourishment in children upto the age of 5 and arguably upto the age of 9, what are ways to do this during teenage growth spurts where larger data is only indicative and cannot be applied to individual children?
- Some of the questions among the many emerging to observe from our sandbox CCIs are: 
	- How many standardized kitchen/food procedures are the cooking staff aware of?  Are meal portions, diet diversity consistent over time? Is there a fixed food budget or is it variable based on incoming donations etc? Is there a fixed grocery purchase template? Is the food stored, transported and cooked in a safe and sanitary way?
	- Do children have individual nutrition plans formally(on paper) or informally(in the minds of staff)? Are food types and quantity adjusted by age and preference? Are special dietary needs accounted for?
	- Are meal table routines strict and process based or personalized? How many children have eating disorders? How many of them are the staff aware of?
	- Are the meals served favoring certain food groups over others? How much of the causation of this is tradition, market availability, funding and taste preferences?
	- Are there emergency procedures in place for lack of funding, drop in food supply etc. ? 
- The larger design question here is narrowing down into : How might we enable the kitchen to be able to quickly identify nutritional deficiencies, eating disorders, psychological & behavioral issues related to food, likes and dislikes and incorporate individual nutrition plans into an efficient, simple and templatized catering system?

## Residual impacts of institutionalization post adoption

 ![Impact of institutionalization on child development_backlinks](https://i.imgur.com/GBTp3Za.png)

- [The Impact of Institutionalization on Child Development_Kim Mclean](Volume%201/Reference%20Reading/Research%20Papers/Global/The%20Impact%20of%20Institutionalization%20on%20Child%20Development_Kim%20Mclean.md)
	- There are several tools that can be used to measure children's IQ, developmental progress and behavior progress. Some examples are : [R-DPDQ](R-DPDQ) [CBCL](CBCL) [Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment](Home%20Observation%20for%20Measurement%20of%20the%20Environment) [SB4](SB4) . I have classified these as [Assessment Tools](Volume%201/Roll%20Ups/Assessment%20Tools.md). 
	- There are also behaviors that children exhibit during interactions that can be observed and tied back to inputs. I have classified these as [Observed behavior assessments](Volume%201/Roll%20Ups/Observed%20behavior%20assessments.md)
		- For Example, children not being able to refuse food likely means that they have not felt satiated often enough and food shortages might be seen in the CCI
		- Repeated motions of the hands, head or feet such as rocking or twitches can be seen as stereotypical behaviors and could be a form of self stimulation, tied back possibly and debatably to :
			- Lack of physical activity
			- Lack of mental stimulation
			- Lack of attention from caregivers
	- Research on institutionalized children has  shown that similar experiences early in life may  result in a variety of outcomes, a phenomenon known as [[multifinality]].
- Reading about anti institutionalization organizations or papers that propagate the benefits of adoption/foster care/family [[restoration]] over institutionalization can be useful because: 
	-  These papers identify gaps that exist in CCIs while arguing their point. These gaps are typically based on research and accurate, and can provide a first layer of direction in intervention at the partner CCIs for CAP. 
- I have started tagging essential reads as #essentialreads. 
- A lot of info in this paper can go into benchmark assessments at CCIs as well as directly onto observational data collected during primary research

## IQ Growth, Differentiation and period of institutionalization

- [Irvington HouseGrowth Potential of Pre-school aged children in institutional care](Volume%201/Reference%20Reading/CCIs/Intl/Irvington%20HouseGrowth%20Potential%20of%20Pre-school%20aged%20children%20in%20institutional%20care.md) 
	- An IQ test conducted in Irvington house suggests that the maximum growth in IQ occurs around the 12 month mark since admission. 
	- It also suggests that institutional care has the maximum impact on IQ of children who either enter with
		- Low IQ and High IQ : As it compensates for environmental factors in the child's history that held them back
- This could be interesting for the first year of admission of a child, in terms of differentiating instruction and support for children based on entry benchmarks similar to what is done in Education Interventions


# Jan 2022 Summary
## Program Design 

 - Most existing recommendations from practitioners tend to align in principle on a key aspect of positive outcomes for children being empowering staff at CCIs. 
	- Ensuring staff are positive role models:
		- Factors important here, based on experiences of organizations such as Aangan and Miracle Foundation would be accessibility of staff, quality of the interactions, availability of information to staff and children, orientation for the relationship and a shift to a positive approach to disciplinary action.
		 - Having pre-scheduled interaction points between CCI staff and children to ensure positive role model building.
		 - Staff retention being key to ensuring a feeling of permanence or home-likeness to CCIs.
		 - Staff to child ratio being important towards being able to provide individualized care
		 - Clear SoPs and plans to deal with physical/sexual abuse between peers as well as by staff. 
		 -  Importance of maintaining a regular daily routine, minimizing negative responses to deviations from expected child behavior, and maximizing child safety.
		 - Ensuring safety, choice, collaboration, trust building and individual empowerment among children to ensure care is trauma informed


- During the design of the CAP product itself, keenly observing practices in related spaces like ed-tech, elite hostels and boarding schools, pediatric Hospital Wards and sporting academies might be key to ensuring that this product is not re-inventing the wheel. Even more so because the childcare space hasn't caught up to the innovations in these other fields.
