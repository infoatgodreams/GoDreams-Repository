	- Ensuring staff are positive role models:

		 - Having pre-scheduled interaction points between CCI staff and children to ensure positive role model building.
		 - Staff retention being key to ensuring a feeling of permanence or home-likeness to CCIs.
		 - Staff to child ratio being important towards being able to provide individualized care

		 -  Importance of maintaining a regular daily routine, minimizing negative responses to deviations from expected child behavior, and maximizing child safety.
		 - Ensuring safety, choice, collaboration, trust building and individual empowerment among children to ensure care is trauma informed
