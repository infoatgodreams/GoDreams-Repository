# Negative Mental Health Effects of Institutionalisation


- In a paper on psychosocial distress among children in institutional care in Delhi, Statistics show that India is home for the 30 million orphan and vulnerable children (OVC), the largest in the South Asian region
- According to Udayan Care, [^1]Some studies have found that violence in residential institutions is six times higher than violence in foster care, and that children in group care are almost four times more likely to experience sexual abuse than children-in family-based care.16 (Page 17)
- Small institutions developed on community based models can actually guarantee a healthy growth to specific kinds of children. For example a small group setting with trained staff  can provide the needed therapeutic care-or treatment for children who have suffered trauma or severe abuse or neglect. To enable large sibling groups to-remain together, a residential care setting may also be the best option. 
- According to a study on psychosocial well-being conducted by Duke [^2], that used a sample population of 2013 children (923 in institutions and 1,090 community-based care settings) from Cambodia, Hyderabad, Nagaland, Kenya, Tanzania, Ethipia, Child psychosocial well-being across “high” and “low” levels of quality of care showed negligible differences between residential- and community-based care settings, suggesting the important factor in child well-being is quality of care rather than setting of care. 
- Several oft-cited studies of infant children who lived in socially and emotionally deprived institutions in Europe have concluded that institutional care is damaging to the development of young children relative to community-based foster care. Indeed, some studies demonstrated powerful negative effects of deprivation on infant development, and positive development when the infants were moved to live with well trained and paid foster parents.[18,24] These studies of infants in a very specific and negative caregiving environment have been generalized to a belief that all residential care settings across the world must have the same poor caregiving characteristics: high child-to-caregiver ratios, shift work, low compensation for caregivers, regimented and non-individualized care, and a lack of psychological investment in the children.
- In addition, Whetten et al.[37] found that children in residential care centers across five LMICs (Cambodia, India, Kenya, Tanzania, and Ethiopia) fared better than those in community settings on several outcomes, including physical health, behavioral and emotional health, intellectual functioning, and memory. They also reported great variability between individuals within care settings (larger than variability between sites or variability between care settings within a site), and after adjusting for sites, age, and gender, discovered that residential care vs. community-based care settings explained only 0.3–7% of the variability in child outcomes.
- Thus, the development of positive child outcomes (such as psychosocial well-being) may not be heavily dependent on membership in a community-based setting like a Western-style nuclear family. It may instead be dependent primarily on the availability of certain components of quality of care rather than the living environment itself where OSC receive care.
-  Findings suggested that higher levels of all four components of quality of care (food security, quality of shelter, quality of caregiving, and access to health care services) significantly predicted more positive psychosocial well-being. Compared to the 0% variance explained by care setting in this current model, food security explained 13.4% of the variance in psychosocial well-being, while quality of shelter explained 10%, quality of caregiving explained 8.9%, and access to health care services explained 7.3%. Moreover, mean SDQ total difficulties scores across “high” and “low” levels of quality of care showed differences between care settings to be minimal, and are therefore considered null results.
- Acc to Udayan Care [^1], the Study on Child Abuse conducted in 2007 by the Ministry of Women and Child Development(MWCD) recorded that 56.73 percent of children in institutions in 13 Indian states reported having been subjected to physical abuse by the staff  members of institutions. (Page 43)
- According to the Counsel to Secure Justice, [^3]The psychological effect of institutionalisation on children can be severe because of the-isolation from the family and community within the institutional setting. Many children-develop long-term mental health difficulties including depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation (Ståhlberg,  Anckarsäter, & Nilsson, 2010). (Page 10)
- The family’s anger at the child owing to their actions often strains their relationship. In addition, the limited time for meeting with the child, which requires significant time and monetary investment, further builds anger and resentment and frequently impacts relationships (Page 10)
- Institutionalisation may influence the children adversely as they come into contact with-others who may be part of criminal gangs or may have knowledge on weapons, tools, methods for committing wrongs (Page 11)
- Stigma and shame (for the child and the family) arise from being involved with the legal system (Page 11)
- In a literature review on institutional care conducted by the University of Delaware [^4], the authors describe, Indiscriminately sociable behavior refers to children’s lack of reticence with unfamiliar adults, willingness to approach and engage strangers, and failure to maintain proximity to attachment figures in unfamiliar settings. O’Connor and colleagues (O’Connor et al., 2000;O’Connor & Zeanah, 2003) have emphasized the lack of social boundaries among children with this behavior pattern. Zeanah et al. (2005) found that 44% of institutionalized children showed high levels of indiscriminately sociable behavior as contrasted with 18% of children who had never been institutionalized. (Page 6)
- Hence children with disabilities are frequently at higher risk of staff  violence in institutions than other boys and girls, necessitating more efforts, competence and open-minded attitude from the duty bearers to adequately fulfil, respect and protect their rights. (Page 32) - First of all, children with disabilities are often not entitled to their right to independence and little effort is made to assure that the infrastructures of the institutions they live in can guarantee them not only a child-friendly environment, but especially one which supports their independent living. Their right to development is rarely considered and little is done to ensure that children with disabilities gain adequate education and life skills, fulfilling the prejudice that they cannot support themselves once they reach adulthood. (Page 34)
- A couple of the participants mentioned that the staff  of the institutions is less aware of the talents and qualities of the children in comparison to a family, where every child gets special attention from his/her parents; or that in the Homes it often happens that only children with particular capacities are cared for, while others are left behind. (Page 81)
- In a paper of intervention studies [^5], 
	- individuals with a history of early institutional care showed more academic difficulties and deficits in social skills, such as maintaining trustful interpersonal relationships (Frank, Klass, Earls, &amp; Eisenberg, 1996; Merz, McCall, &amp; Wright, 2013).
	- child maltreatment has been related to epigenetic changes in the stress response axis (Hecker, Radtke, Hermenau, Papassotiropoulos, &amp; Elbert, 2016; McGowan et al., 2009)
	- Usually, the child care institutions are able to offer basic provisions of food and shelter, but they lack adequate means to offer sensitive, child-oriented care, possibly leading to the emotional and physical neglect of many children (Oliveira et al., 2012; Vashchenko et al., 2010)
	- the reported worldwide rates of violence against children in institutional care were 6 times higher than those of children living in family-based foster care

	### MOST COMMON DISORDERS THAT AFFECTED CHILDREN IN INSTITUTIONAL CARE
	
	- Somatic disorders (eating disorders, skin lesions
	- respiratory disorders, 
	- digestive disorders, sphincter disorders);
	- Attachment disorders (unable to attach or permanent fusion attachment);
	- Behavioural and thinking disorders (mood disorders, delinquency, impulsivity, inhibition, violence, failures in learning)
	- Self-injury (cuts, burns, bites – prostitution, drug addiction, homelessness), suicide
	- Psychiatric disorders (anorexia, anxiety neurosis and traumatic childhood psychoses).

## ATTACHMENT
## ASSESSING TRAUMA RESPONSE IN CHILDREN
- According to Udayan Care [^1], The impact of trauma for each child can vary extremely and must be correctly evaluated. It depends on different variables:
	- The age and sex of the child at the time of loss
	- The nature and quality of the links before the break;
	- Violence suffered
	- The context of early breaks
	- The quality and diversity of care
	- Self-esteem and resilience of each child. (Page 62)
