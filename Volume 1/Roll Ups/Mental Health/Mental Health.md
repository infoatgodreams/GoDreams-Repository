# Negative Mental Health Effects of Institutionalisation


- In a paper on psychosocial distress among children in institutional care in Delhi, Statistics show that India is home for the 30 million orphan and vulnerable children (OVC), the largest in the South Asian region
- According to Udayan Care, [^1]Some studies have found that violence in residential institutions is six times higher than violence in foster care, and that children in group care are almost four times more likely to experience sexual abuse than children-in family-based care.16 (Page 17)
- According to a study on psychosocial well-being conducted by Duke [^2], that used a sample population of 2013 children (923 in institutions and 1,090 community-based care settings) from Cambodia, Hyderabad, Nagaland, Kenya, Tanzania, Ethipia, Child psychosocial well-being across “high” and “low” levels of quality of care showed negligible differences between residential- and community-based care settings, suggesting the important factor in child well-being is quality of care rather than setting of care. 
- Several oft-cited studies of infant children who lived in socially and emotionally deprived institutions in Europe have concluded that institutional care is damaging to the development of young children relative to community-based foster care. Indeed, some studies demonstrated powerful negative effects of deprivation on infant development, and positive development when the infants were moved to live with well trained and paid foster parents.[18,24] These studies of infants in a very specific and negative caregiving environment have been generalized to a belief that all residential care settings across the world must have the same poor caregiving characteristics: high child-to-caregiver ratios, shift work, low compensation for caregivers, regimented and non-individualized care, and a lack of psychological investment in the children.
- In addition, Whetten et al.[37] found that children in residential care centers across five LMICs (Cambodia, India, Kenya, Tanzania, and Ethiopia) fared better than those in community settings on several outcomes, including physical health, behavioral and emotional health, intellectual functioning, and memory. They also reported great variability between individuals within care settings (larger than variability between sites or variability between care settings within a site), and after adjusting for sites, age, and gender, discovered that residential care vs. community-based care settings explained only 0.3–7% of the variability in child outcomes.
- Thus, the development of positive child outcomes (such as psychosocial well-being) may not be heavily dependent on membership in a community-based setting like a Western-style nuclear family. It may instead be dependent primarily on the availability of certain components of quality of care rather than the living environment itself where OSC receive care.
-  Findings suggested that higher levels of all four components of quality of care (food security, quality of shelter, quality of caregiving, and access to health care services) significantly predicted more positive psychosocial well-being. Compared to the 0% variance explained by care setting in this current model, food security explained 13.4% of the variance in psychosocial well-being, while quality of shelter explained 10%, quality of caregiving explained 8.9%, and access to health care services explained 7.3%. Moreover, mean SDQ total difficulties scores across “high” and “low” levels of quality of care showed differences between care settings to be minimal, and are therefore considered null results.
- Acc to Udayan Care [^1], the Study on Child Abuse conducted in 2007 by the Ministry of Women and Child Development(MWCD) recorded that 56.73 percent of children in institutions in 13 Indian states reported having been subjected to physical abuse by the staff  members of institutions. (Page 43)
- According to the Counsel to Secure Justice, [^3]The psychological effect of institutionalisation on children can be severe because of the-isolation from the family and community within the institutional setting. Many children-develop long-term mental health difficulties including depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation (Ståhlberg,  Anckarsäter, & Nilsson, 2010). (Page 10)
- The family’s anger at the child owing to their actions often strains their relationship. In addition, the limited time for meeting with the child, which requires significant time and monetary investment, further builds anger and resentment and frequently impacts relationships (Page 10)
- Institutionalisation may influence the children adversely as they come into contact with-others who may be part of criminal gangs or may have knowledge on weapons, tools, methods for committing wrongs (Page 11)
- Stigma and shame (for the child and the family) arise from being involved with the legal system (Page 11)
- In a literature review on institutional care conducted by the University of Delaware [^4], the authors describe, Indiscriminately sociable behavior refers to children’s lack of reticence with unfamiliar adults, willingness to approach and engage strangers, and failure to maintain proximity to attachment figures in unfamiliar settings. O’Connor and colleagues (O’Connor et al., 2000;O’Connor & Zeanah, 2003) have emphasized the lack of social boundaries among children with this behavior pattern. Zeanah et al. (2005) found that 44% of institutionalized children showed high levels of indiscriminately sociable behavior as contrasted with 18% of children who had never been institutionalized. (Page 6)
- Hence children with disabilities are frequently at higher risk of staff  violence in institutions than other boys and girls, necessitating more efforts, competence and open-minded attitude from the duty bearers to adequately fulfil, respect and protect their rights. (Page 32) - First of all, children with disabilities are often not entitled to their right to independence and little effort is made to assure that the infrastructures of the institutions they live in can guarantee them not only a child-friendly environment, but especially one which supports their independent living. Their right to development is rarely considered and little is done to ensure that children with disabilities gain adequate education and life skills, fulfilling the prejudice that they cannot support themselves once they reach adulthood. (Page 34)
- A couple of the participants mentioned that the staff  of the institutions is less aware of the talents and qualities of the children in comparison to a family, where every child gets special attention from his/her parents; or that in the Homes it often happens that only children with particular capacities are cared for, while others are left behind. (Page 81)
- In a paper of intervention studies [^5], 
	- individuals with a history of early institutional care showed more academic difficulties and deficits in social skills, such as maintaining trustful interpersonal relationships (Frank, Klass, Earls, &amp; Eisenberg, 1996; Merz, McCall, &amp; Wright, 2013).
	- child maltreatment has been related to epigenetic changes in the stress response axis (Hecker, Radtke, Hermenau, Papassotiropoulos, &amp; Elbert, 2016; McGowan et al., 2009)
	- Usually, the child care institutions are able to offer basic provisions of food and shelter, but they lack adequate means to offer sensitive, child-oriented care, possibly leading to the emotional and physical neglect of many children (Oliveira et al., 2012; Vashchenko et al., 2010)
	- the reported worldwide rates of violence against children in institutional care were 6 times higher than those of children living in family-based foster care
- According to Miracle Foundation [^6], 
	- - Evidence indicates that early separation from parents is a risk factor for developing a chronic response to traumatic stressors, meaning that an individual would beless able to positively cope with negative stressors that ome up in their life(Udayan Care, 2014). 
	- regimented nature and lack of individualized care (Child Profile) in institutions can further enable or add additional trauma. Such conditions can result in poor life outcomes for children after they leave CCIs: 
		 •Cognitive and emotional developmental issues such as lower IQ, poorattachment, behavioural issues and distrust of others (Center on theDeveloping Child, 2007). 
		 •Increased likelihood of becoming victims of trafficking, exploitation,substance abuse and suicide (Pashkina, 2001; Udayan Care, 2014). (Page 2)
- [8]Romanian orphanages being characterised as offering extremely basic care, with high child to caregiver ratios, minimal personalisation of experience, and ‘severe psycho social deprivation’ (Page 42)
- - The negative psychological or psycho-social outcomes highlighted by the remaining studies include higher ADHD rates for ‘high deprivation’ groups (Kennedy et al., 2016), lower verbal reasoning and attention compared to family reared children(Barone et al., 2016), lower phonological awareness, nonverbal reasoning, picture vocabulary, kindergarten readiness and pseudo-word decoding (Rakhlin et al., 2017), higher frequency of mental health problems (Rodrigues et al., 2019), and lower cognitive, intellectual, and emotional functions than on- institutionalised children (Deambrosio et al., 2017). (Page 39)
- The BEIP is a large scale, Randomised Control Trial (RCT) of children and young people who were resident in Romanian orphanages in 2001. RCTs are the ‘gold standard’ of research methodologies due to their lack of potential bias’. Children in the BEIP were randomised into either the ‘Care As UsualGroup’ (CAUG) (the group who remained in institutional care), or ‘High Quality Foster Care Group’(FCG), and a comparison group of non-institutionally raised children were matched by age and gender.Measures were taken at the point of allocation, and the children were followed up at ages eight (2009),twelve (2013), and 16 (2017). (Page 41)
- 40The findings from the BEIP in relation to outcomes for children and young people who are cared for in institutional settings include
	- No biological differences between children who were raised in institutional environments and those in the comparison group who had never been cared for in an institutional environment ,nor with those who had been randomised to high quality foster care.
	- Lower IQ scores for both FCG and CAUG as compared to the comparison group.
	- Higher levels of callous-unemotional traits among children who experienced any institutional (Page 41)care as opposed to the comparison group. 
	- Those randomised to the FCG had significantly lower levels of these traits compared to the CAUG. These differences were mediated by caregiver responsiveness to distress in boys.
	- Children in the FCG were more likely to display adaptive functioning than those in the CAUG, with those placed into the FCG prior to age 20 months more likely to display adaptive functioning than those placed aged 20+ months.
	- Slight developmental delay in processing of fearful faces in the CAUG compared to the comparison and FCG.
	- Higher psychopathology among those in CAUG and the FCG compared to the comparison group at ages 8, 12, and 16. The FCG had significantly lower psychopathology than the CAUGat age 16. Particularly high rates of attention problems, poor self-regulation, attachment disorders and anxiety are noted among those who experienced institutional care.
	- Children who experienced institutional care had reduced cognitive processing speed compared to the comparison group.
	- Together, the studies demonstrate that while institutional care can result in significant detriment in a wide range of domains, moving to high quality foster care placements can go a long way to mitigating or entirely reversing these detriments. 
	- Throughout the studies, it is demonstrated that being removed from institutional care and placed in a foster care environment reduced the prevalence of psychiatric disorders, and promoted healthy brain and socio-emotional development. (Page 42)
	- [^10]Even if all the socio-economic factors shaping child’s development and achievement are taken out of the equation, parental involvement during the transition from childhood to adolescence and adulthood remains an important predictor of child’s social well-being 




	### MOST COMMON DISORDERS THAT AFFECTED CHILDREN IN INSTITUTIONAL CARE
	
	- Somatic disorders (eating disorders, skin lesions
	- respiratory disorders, 
	- digestive disorders, sphincter disorders);
	- Attachment disorders (unable to attach or permanent fusion attachment);
	- Behavioural and thinking disorders (mood disorders, delinquency, impulsivity, inhibition, violence, failures in learning)
	- Self-injury (cuts, burns, bites – prostitution, drug addiction, homelessness), suicide
	- Psychiatric disorders (anorexia, anxiety neurosis and traumatic childhood psychoses).

## ATTACHMENT
### INTRO TO ATTACHMENT
- According to Udayan Care[^1], The most important emotional ties a child builds are those created before s/he reaches five years of age; (Page 56)
- Early attachment accounts for differences in people’s cognition, behaviour, social skills, and emotional responses, and also leads to the development of internal working models.
- Secure attachment in childhood makes us grow up with a view of ourselves as secure and competent, and of the world as safe. Secure attachment buffers the impact of trauma, it basically keeps humans alive.
- The risk of developmental and psychological damage is particularly acute for young children under the age of four, which is a critical period for children to bond to their parents or care-givers. Even in a very well-equipped institution with focused staff , it is unlikely that the attention they would receive by the personnel could replace good parental care.71
- [4]Bowlby (1969/1982), the architect of attachment theory, proposed that human infants, like the young of many other species, have a need to form attachments to primary caregivers. The attachment system serves to enhance the child’s likelihood of survival (andthus survival of the genes) because the infant seeks to maintain proximity to the caregiver under conditions of threat. (Page 3)


### ATTACHMENT STRUGGLES
**INSECURE ATTACHMENT**
- A child can also develop insecure attachment when caregivers are generally unavailable or they are rejecting him/her. In this way the infant develops internal representations of low self-worth. Insecure attachment is not a psychopathology but it is a risk factor for it. Possible consequences of insecure attachment are:
	• Poor self-esteem and self-regulation;
	• Aggressive/rejecting and/or withdrawn/ isolating relations with peers;
	• Low frustration tolerance;
	• Less positive affect;
	• Lags in cognitive, developmental and academic competence;
	• Increase in behavioural symptomatology (anxiety and depression).

- **DISORGANIZED ATTACHMENT**
	- Freud defined attachment important because it creates a stimulus barrier, a sort of protective shield for the child. Every age has in fact appropriate emotional tasks and burdens to be taken. When this protective shield gets broken too early because of emotional abuse, the child will be damaged internally and develop disorganised attachment. 
	- **Disorganised attachment is a pathology, which leads to difficulties in emotional regulation and social function.**
	- Disorganised attachment is significant in traumatised children because it takes place when the child does not receive enough emotional support, directions and structure by his/her care givers or when the environment surrounding the child is particularly stressful.
	- Continuous changes in the caregiver’s emotional functioning and in mother-child interactions can lead to disorganised attachment. Outcomes of disorganized attachment
		- Problems with affect regulation and dissociation;
		- Lack of impulse control and attention problems;
		- Controlling stance used with peers and caregiver relationships;
		- Cognitive impairments;
		- High risk for psychopathology;
		- Cycles get repeated when they grow up and have kids of their own.

- In a qualitative interview study of children in a home in Delhi[^7], children reported that they refrained from interacting with any outsider because they didn’t know what to say and hesitated to put forth their opinions. Attachment disorders were also reported among participants.
- According to a study on fostering [^5], Children may develop a low-quality attachment bond or even lack an attachment relationship altogether in the absence of adequate care
- Taken together with the experience of violence and abuse, this lack may impact the child’s stress response system, and, in this way, the development and structure of the brain as well. These changes to neurodevelopment may lead to mental health problems, such as depression, post traumatic stress disorder, and internalising and externalising problems
- [^8]Many of these evidenced a negative impact of residential environments on attachment styles compared to family environments (Barone et al., 2016; Quiroga & Hamilton-Giachritsis, 2017; Vacaru et al., 2018), (Page 38)
### INTERVENTIONS 
- According to a review paper on institutional care[^8], Use of the Attachment Regulation and Competency framework inresidential care was found to be associated with a reduction in post-traumatic stress symptomology, (Page 32)
- [[Attachment and Bio-Behavioral Catchup Approach (ABC)]]
- The ABC intervention targets regulatory issues, attachment quality, and indiscriminatesociability. 
- The original ABC intervention model had been shown to be effective with high-risk birth children and with foster children (Bernard et al., in press; Dozier et al., 2006). 
- The adapted intervention is currently being tested in a randomized clinical trial with internationally adopted children. 
- Three issues targeted in the intervention are described below:
	- The first component of ABC targets children’s self-regulatory capabilities by helping parents to learn to behave in synchronous ways with their children. 
		- This component is adapted from interventions that have targeted the importance of interactional synchrony in enhancing regulatory capabilities among infants(Calkins, 2011). 
		- Shonkoff and colleagues (Shonkoff & Bales, 2011; Shonkoff,Boyce, & McEwen, 2009) have suggested that such interactions be referred to as“serve and return” in that the caring adult “returns” the child’s “serve.” For example, when a child bangs two blocks together, the parent is urged to follow along (e.g., banging two blocks together herself or commenting on what the child is doing) rather than to direct the play (e.g., suggest that the child build a tower orcomment on the color or shape of the blocks).
		- Children who have been institutionalized are often dysregulated biologically (e.g.,as seen in HPA axis functioning), and behaviorally (e.g., as seen in problems in sustained attention). It is expected that this intervention component will enhance children’s cortisol regulation, attention, and behavioral control. 
		- In randomized clinical trials with foster and high-risk children living with their birth parents, the intervention has been found to enhance cortisol regulation and behavioral outcomes(Dozier et al., 2006; Dozier et al., 2009; Dozier, Peloso, Lewis, Laurenceau, &Levine, 2008). (Page 11).
- In the intervention, adoptive parents are helped to reinterpret their children’s behavioral signals, providing nurturance even when it is not elicited. 
	- This intervention component is expected to enhance parental nurturance, and to enhance children’s attachment quality. 
	- Stovall and Dozier (Stovall & Dozier, 2000;Stovall-McClough & Dozier, 2004) found that children who experienced early adversity often behave in avoidant or resistant ways (e.g., turning away from caregivers when distressed), eliciting complementary behaviors from their parents
-  The final issue addressed by the ABC intervention is indiscriminately sociable behaviors.
	-  These behaviors are targeted by helping adoptive parents recognize thesigns of indiscriminate sociability and develop strategies for discouraging thebehavior.
	-  Decreased indiscriminate sociability is expected as a result of this intervention component. 
	- We do not yet have data that suggest whether we will be successful in affecting this behavior because we have not targeted this behavior in other interventions. (Page 11)
- In our randomized clinical trial with high-risk birthparents, only 32% of the children whose parents received the ABC intervention showed disorganized attachments, as contrasted with 57% of the children whose parents received the control intervention (Bernard et al., 2011). (Page 11)

### CARE PRACTICES 
- At Miracle Foundation, [^6] Earlier, during meal time children stood in a line, were served food, after which they sat in the dining room and ate quietly. There was no concept of house parents sitting with the children, narrating stories, paying attention to whether children were eating properly or not [Nutrition](Volume%201/Roll%20Ups/Nutrition/Nutrition.md), whereas with setting up of family units, children sat in groups with their respective house parents, talked about their day at school and had fun. This helped to strengthen the bond and attachment between the house parents and the children. (Page 11)
- According to a review paper on institutional care [^8]The number of children each caregiver has under her care seems to be crucial, with larger groups of children experiencing difficulties in establishing a secure attachment, while smaller groups facilitate security (Page 30)
- Small institutions developed on community based models can actually guarantee a healthy growth to specific kinds of children. For example a small group setting with trained staff  can provide the needed therapeutic care-or treatment for children who have suffered trauma or severe abuse or neglect. To enable large sibling groups to-remain together, a residential care setting may also be the best option. 


### CONSTRAINTS OF AN INSTITUTIONAL SETTING

• Compulsion to follow an imposed structure in day to day activities.
• Lack of access to the world outside the boundaries of the institutional structure.
• Inability to get special care and personalised space.
• Moral code imposed by the administrative policies of the institutional set up.
• Lack of provisions to accommodate the change in individual rights when girls turn 18 years of age.
• Provisions for a counselor are insufficient to appoint competent individuals.
• Only a limited set of livelihood training programmes can be made available – not sufficient to cater to individual future aspirations.
• Limited access to the outer world due to lack of mobility and exposure.

# TRAUMA

## ASSESSING TRAUMA RESPONSE IN CHILDREN
- According to Udayan Care [^1], The impact of trauma for each child can vary extremely and must be correctly evaluated. It depends on different variables:
	- The age and sex of the child at the time of loss
	- The nature and quality of the links before the break;
	- Violence suffered
	- The context of early breaks
	- The quality and diversity of care
	- Self-esteem and resilience of each child. (Page 62)
- According to Prerana [^9] Lack of sensitivity towards the child’s health concerns: The principle of confidentiality is not upheld in the highest regard when addressing a child’s health concerns. In the past, staff of government hospitals have been insensitive towards victims of sexual exploitation. Some CH staff members may also lack the awareness about mental health and disorders, may not be equipped to deal with children who have been through traumatic experiences which may end up in re-victimizing the resident.

## TRAUMA INFORMED CARE
- The model of TIC used in this article comes from Institute on Trauma and Trauma-Informed Care at the University of Buffalo, and is based on Harris and Fallot’s Using Trauma Theory to Design Service Systems(Page 3)
- On the latter point, studies point to the implementation of organisation wideapproaches to trauma informed care as a mechanism to prevent staff ‘burnout’ and reduce turnover(Bailey et al., 2019). (Page 30)
- The five guiding principles of TIC-Trauma Informed Care
	•Safety: Ensuring individual’s physical and emotional safety. 
	•Choice: Individual has choice and control. They are made well aware oftheir rights and responsibilities. 
	•Collaboration: Making decisions with the individual and sharing powerincreases participation in and effectiveness of services. 
	•Trustworthiness: Task clarity, consistency and interpersonal boundaries between an individual and her/his care provider. 
	•Empowerment: Building on individuals’ strength and developing coping skills for them to fall back on if and when services stop. Individuals feel validated and affirmed with every contact with the agency. (Page 3)

# COMMON MENTAL HEALTH DIFFICULTIES- CHILDREN'S PERSPECTIVE 

From a qualitative study of children in children's homes in Delhi, following concerns were highlighted by children

- Depression and stress: study revealed that the majority of children felt sad and depressed due to their stay in the orphanage and also due to parental bereavement
- Low self-esteem and purpose: children reported low levels of self-esteem and lacked purpose in life. The majority of children felt they were worthless and good for nothing.
- Loneliness and helplessness: in-depth interviews of participants reflected that most of them were lonely and often felt helpless. Two boys told (12-year-old and 10-year-old) stated that, “We feel we are a burden on others. Nobody is interested to know how was our day at school or how we are feeling. No one bothers about us.”
- Love and affection: Results also indicated that due to parental bereavement children were longing for love and affection especially the younger ones; they would not understand why they ended up living in an orphanage.
- The majority of children stated that they still miss their parents and often have a problem falling asleep due to their memories. Seeing other kids with parents often reminded them of their families
- Social issues

## Behavioral concerns:
- Others reported that they refrained from interacting with any outsider because they didn’t know what to say and hesitated to put forth their opinions. Attachment disorders were also reported among participants.
- Lack of guidance: the majority of OVC reported that they lack adult guidance and advocacy. Although children were going to school, they didn’t know what to do afterward or what they will do once they go out of the orphanage
- Rejection: children staying in orphanages often feel rejected and disowned by own people. These dejected children enter children homes which in no ways can replace familial love and affection.
- Recognition and approval: most of the times OVC have to experience stigmatization by society.
- Many children reported their concern about whether they will be able to fit in the society or more so be accepted by the society.
- Security: these children lead a stressful life, and once they go out of orphanage they are likely to slip into poverty. They don’t have any special training or any assurance of a job
- Isolation: this was the most common problem of children living in institutional care. Most of them felt that they were not free enough to interact with people outside the orphanage.

## Coping Strategies
 
- Spiritual approach: Most of the children reported that whenever they are worried or upset about something they prayed to the God. They said that they often complained to the God about the hardships of life and felt better.
- Supporting inmates: the majority of children said they whenever some children have a problem especially younger ones we try to solve it and support them.
- Suppressing feelings: it was found that while most of the children yearned for their parents, some considered that actively suppressing feelings and forgetting about problems associated with parents is the key to psychological recovery and happiness
- Shifting focus to other activities: many children reported that whenever they felt down, they tried to focus on something else like any activity which made them happy like playing with other inmates, studying, watching television or simply by going to sleep.
- Substance abuse some older children accepted that many times they smoked and chewed tobacco to avoid tension and be carefree. Some other reported that they often used pain relieving balms as inhalants to relieve tension and anxiety. 
- Self-discrimination: these practices were more common among younger children or those who were new to the atmosphere of the orphanage they often sit alone, cry a lot, skip meals and isolate themselves which was harmful to their wellbeing.
-  Misbehavior: some children accepted that whenever they are stressed, they get irritated very easily on small things and felt agitated and therefore, took out their anger on fellow children and sometimes even on the caregivers.
- Detachment: some children also reported that to keep the emotions at bay they try not to be sentimental or emotionally attached to people around them. They feel that detachment from others would save and secure them from getting hurt.

# BEST PRACTICES IN CCIs
## SHARING CIRCLES 
## What is a circle process and how was it conducted? 

[3]Restorative circles are a talking-based activity which give participants an opportunity to speak and listen to one another in an atmosphere of safety and without hierarchy. (Page 11)
- Circle processes –a talking-based activity where participants sit in a circle facing each other. Each participant gets an opportunity to speak sequentially. While one person is speaking, others listen to them without interrupting.
- Circle facilitators/keepers – one or two individuals who facilitate the circle processes.They ask questions which guide the discussion but, apart from that, participate in equal ways as other in the circle.
- Master Trainers – six designated individuals trained during this project to facilitate restorative circles. (Page 5)

## STEPS IN A SHARING CIRCLE
 Children sit in a circular formation facing each otherso that each person can see the others. (Page 13)
- Two circle keepers facilitate the process and are also referred to as co-facilitators. (Page 13)
- Circles use a talking piece, any object which is passed around from one person to the other sequentially (Wilbur, Wilbur, Garrett, & Yuhas, 2001).Each person gets the opportunity to share when they hold the talking piece, while all others are invited to listen to them. (Page 13)
- Circles use a sequential format, where one person speaks at a time, and the opportunity to speak moves in one direction around the circle. Each person must wait to speak until their turn, and no one may interrupt while another person is speaking. (Page 14)
- Circles reflect Vygotsky’s constructivist theory of learning, i.e., children learn from their surroundings when the environment is inclusive and supportive (Page 14)
- Circles are designed in a structured way, planned once a week on a specific day with a specific plan (Mosley, 2016). Each circle plan has distinct stages, with each stage having a predetermined purpose which allow children to feel safe, comfortable, talk, and experience enjoyment. (Page 14)
- No one is judged based on their performance or the extent of their involvement. (Page 15)
- All participants are told that participation is voluntary and that they can leave at any time. (Page 15)

## OBJECTIVES OF SHARING CIRCLES
- reduce the adverse impact of institutionalization and 
- build positive impact through promoting social emotional learning. 
- to learn the five components of social emotional learning are: self-awareness; self-management; social awareness; relationship skills; and responsible decision-making. (Page 11)
- improving social emotional learning skills (Page 12)
- empathy for any person they may have harmed (Page 12)
- empathy for their own families by thinking through the impact on them. (Page 12)
- a sense of accountability: (Page 12)
- reducing bullying and violence within the home (Page 12)
- change in harmful belief patterns. (Page 12)

## POSITIVE OUTCOMES OBSERVED
- Young girls with low self-esteem began perceiving themselves as more competent and confident after participating in circles (Page 12)
- Boys with emotional and behavioral disorders showed improved behavior after participating in circles (Page 12)
- Over four months of circle processes, children have become equipped to identify emotions usingtangible tools such as feeling charts and emotion temperature scales. (Page 15)
- Crucial learning for children as it helps them to understand that the emotions are transient and do not have to control them or their behaviour. This helps children develop more control over their emotions. (Page 17)
- - Circles helped children think through how their emotions are separate from their behaviours, and behaviours do not need to be driven by emotions (Page 19)
- Along with identifying emotions, children indicated an understanding of how emotional experiences can vary in intensity. Art based tools are helpful for children to understand this variance in intensity of emotions (Page 19)
- Children recognizing these gender stereotypes as social constructs paves the way for them to understand their role in perpetuating these, as well as in the adverse impact of these stereotypes on them (Page 26)
- Children increasingly felt comfortable voicing themselves and their opinion in the circle, including expressing actions/thoughts which may not be perceived as socially desirable. (Page 28)
- children space to think through their strengths and build on these. This allows children to believe that they have something to offer and achieve (Holcomb-McCoy, 2007). (Page 29)
