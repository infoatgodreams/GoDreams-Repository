# Current realities in the sector
- In a paper on psychosocial distress among children in institutional care in Delhi, Statistics show that India is home for the 30 million orphan and vulnerable children (OVC), the largest in the South Asian region
- According to Udayan Care, [^1]Some studies have found that violence in residential institutions is six times higher than violence in foster care, and that children in group care are almost four times more likely to experience sexual abuse than children-in family-based care.16 (Page 17)
- Small institutions developed on community based models can actually guarantee a healthy growth to specific kinds of children. For example a small group setting with trained staff  can provide the needed therapeutic care-or treatment for children who have suffered trauma or severe abuse or neglect. To enable large sibling groups to-remain together, a residential care setting may also be the best option. 
- According to a study on psychosocial well-being conducted by Duke, that used a sample population of 2013 children (923 in institutions and 1,090 community-based care settings) from Cambodia, Hyderabad, Nagaland, Kenya, Tanzania, Ethipia, Child psychosocial well-being across “high” and “low” levels of quality of care showed negligible differences between residential- and community-based care settings, suggesting the important factor in child well-being is quality of care rather than setting of care. 
- Several oft-cited studies of infant children who lived in socially and emotionally deprived institutions in Europe have concluded that institutional care is damaging to the development of young children relative to community-based foster care. Indeed, some studies demonstrated powerful negative effects of deprivation on infant development, and positive development when the infants were moved to live with welltrained and paid foster parents.[18,24] These studies of infants in a very specific and negative caregiving environment have been generalized to a belief that all residential care settings across the world must have the same poor caregiving characteristics: high child-to-caregiver ratios, shift work, low compensation for caregivers, regimented and non-individualized care, and a lack of psychological investment in the children.
- In addition, Whetten et al.[37] found that children in residential care centers across five LMICs (Cambodia, India, Kenya, Tanzania, and Ethiopia) fared better than those in community settings on several outcomes, including physical health, behavioral and emotional health, intellectual functioning, and memory. They also reported great variability between individuals within care settings (larger than variability between sites or variability between care settings within a site), and after adjusting for sites, age, and gender, discovered that residential care vs. community-based care settings explained only 0.3–7% of the variability in child outcomes.
- Thus, the development of positive child outcomes (such as psychosocial well-being) may not be heavily dependent on membership in a community-based setting like a Western-style nuclear family. It may instead be dependent primarily on the availability of certain components of quality of care rather than the living environment itself where OSC receive care.
-  Findings suggested that higher levels of all four components of quality of care (food security, quality of shelter, quality of caregiving, and access to health care services) significantly predicted more positive psychosocial well-being. Compared to the 0% variance explained by care setting in this current model, food security explained 13.4% of the variance in psychosocial well-being, while quality of shelter explained 10%, quality of caregiving explained 8.9%, and access to health care services explained 7.3%. Moreover, mean SDQ total difficulties scores across “high” and “low” levels of quality of care showed differences between care settings to be minimal, and are therefore considered null results.
- Acc to Udayan Care [^1], the Study on Child Abuse conducted in 2007 by the Ministry of Women and Child Development(MWCD) recorded that 56.73 percent of children in institutions in 13 Indian states reported having been subjected to physical abuse by the staff  members of institutions. (Page 43)
