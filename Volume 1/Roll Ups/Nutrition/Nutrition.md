# Introduction
- According to the [Global Childhood Report 2021](Volume%203/Reference%20Reading/Research%20Papers/Global%20Research/Global%20Childhood%20Report%202021.md)[^7] , malnutrition has been classified as a "childhood ender". 
# Signs and symptoms of deficiencies

 - Small Head Circumference : Especially for children under the age of 4
 - Atypically short height and weight
- Symptoms of Vitamin deficiencies observed in India  [^3]
		 - All genders from ages 6-11 were:

		 		 - Eye infections
		 		 - Otolaryngological issues: 
		 - Girls from age 12-18

# Macro Nutrients
*Nutrients that the body requires in large amounts*

 -  A study[^3]  in 4 states in India noted that 
	 - Protein levels were not low
	 - Energy intake falling short of RDA


# Micro Nutrients
*Nutrients that the body requires in small amounts*	
 -  A study[^3]  in 4 states in India noted that :
	 - Common deficiencies from age 6-11 were 
		 - Vitamin A - Bitots Spots
		 - Vitamin B Complex  - Angular Stomatitis

# Eating Behaviors
 - According to a meta analysis[^4]  including children adopted from Romanian orphanages and others, 65% of orphanage children continued to have eating problems even 11 months after adoption :
	 - 1/3 of young children refused to eat solid food
	 - ~1/3 overate, many children never refused food either due to catch up mechanism as a response to malnourishment or because they had never eaten enough food to allow them to learn feelings of satiety. 
- Older children are often fed the same quantity of food as the younger children resulting in lower than required intake [^3]
# Caregiver Best Practices
## Meal Prep
- Children's Nutrition and Diet Scale
	- SoPs are to be created and put up [^2], that define the 
		- Minimum Nutritional Standard
		- Special meals on holidays and festivals
		- Special diets for infants and sick children
		- Meal Timings and Daily Menu


## During Meals

- Sitting with the children during meals 
	-  Paying attention to whether children eat properly is critical to noticing eating patterns and in increasing the caregiver : child bond. [^1]
	- 


## Post Meal





# Diagnostic Tools

## WHO standards

- WHO has built a software tool and graphs/tables for field measurements of height to age , weight to age and BMI to age ratios [^5]
	- The tool is more accurate for children below the age of 5
	- For children above the age of 5, a loose reference version of the tool modified by the Indian Pediatrics Association, is available as part of the [Revised IAP Growth Charts for Height, Weight and Body Mass Index for 5 to 18 year old Indian Children](Volume%201/Reference%20Reading/Governments%20&%20UN/IAP/Revised%20IAP%20Growth%20Charts%20for%20Height,%20Weight%20and%20Body%20Mass%20Index%20for%205%20to%2018%20year%20old%20Indian%20Children.md) [^6]  written in 2014
- These tools can be used to assess overall dietary inputs and gaps at a macro level

## CCI Level Assessments
- ==Publicly available micro level tracking tools for nutritional outputs remain to be found==
	- This can be designed with the help of a nutritionist and a pediatrician.
