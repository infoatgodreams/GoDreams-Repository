# Introduction
- According to the [Global Childhood Report 2021](Volume%203/Reference%20Reading/Research%20Papers/Global%20Research/Global%20Childhood%20Report%202021.md)[^7] by Save the Children, malnutrition has been classified as a "childhood ender". India ranks 118/186 countries on the list
	- 34.7% of children between the ages of 0-5 have been classified as "Stunted" 
- According to the [Budget for Children 2022-23 Analysis](Volume%203/Reference%20Reading/Governments%20&%20UN/Budget%20for%20Children%202022-23%20Analysis.md)[^8]
	- The share of children under the [[Saksham Anganwadi]] and [[Poshan 2.0]] scheme has observed a reduced allocation of 11.28 per cent with allocations going down from INR 19412.5 Crore in 2021-22 (BE) to INR 17223.61 Crore in Union Budget 2022-23 (BE).
	- Nutritional deficiencies have been shown to have a negative impact on cognition [^9],

# Signs and symptoms of nutritional deficiencies

- Small Head Circumference : Especially for children under the age of 4 
- Atypically short height and weight
- Symptoms of Vitamin deficiencies observed in India  [^3]
		 - All genders from ages 6-11 were: 
		 		 - Phrynoderma
		 		 - Dental Mottling : Fluorosis
		 		 - Fever
		 		 - Common Cold
		 		 - Cough
		 		 - Diarrhea
		 		 - Skin infections
		 		 - Eye infections
		 		 - Otolaryngological issues: 
		 - Girls from age 12-18
		 		 - Anemia - Pallor 
- A study in Kenya [^10] suggested that the following were very common in malnourished orphanage children: 
	- ARI (Accute respiratory infections)
	- Malaria
	- Diarrhoea
	- 
## Stunting
- [Stunting in a nutshell (who.int)](https://www.who.int/news/item/19-11-2015-stunting-in-a-nutshell#:~:text=Stunting%20is%20the%20impaired%20growth,WHO%20Child%20Growth%20Standards%20median.) : Stunting is the impaired growth and development that children experience from poor nutrition, repeated infection, and inadequate psychosocial stimulation. Children are defined as stunted if their height-for-age is more than two standard deviations below the [WHO Child Growth Standards](Volume%201/Reference%20Reading/Governments%20&%20UN/WHO/WHO_Growth%20reference%20for%20school%20aged%20children%20and%20adolescents.md) median.
- According to a meta study of global research, stunting prevalence can vary from 9–72%; [^12]
- In a study in Ethiopia [^11], Being a double orphaned child and lack of vitamin A supplement in the last six months were significant predictors of stunting in children aged 1-5
	- Children who did not take **Vitamin A supplement** in the last six months had a 1.9 times greater risk of stunting in comparison with children who took the recommended dose.
	-  This effect was greater in children who were not breastfed
	- This suggests that **vitamin A supplementation may be protective against stunting, or may reverse stunting.
- According to this study [^9] in India, there is accumulating evidence that early malnutrition, marked by stunting, is associated with long-term deficits in cognitive and academic performance, even when social and psychological differences are controlled.

## Wasting
- [Malnutrition (who.int)](https://www.who.int/health-topics/malnutrition) Wasting is defined as low weight-for-height. It often indicates recent and severe weight loss, although it can also persist for a long time. It usually occurs when a person has not had food of adequate quality and quantity and/or they have had frequent or prolonged illnesses. Wasting in children is associated with a higher risk of death if not treated properly.
- According to a meta study of global research, wasting prevalence can vary from 0–27%; [^12]
- In the Kenyan study [^10] the levels of undernutrition were also lower than the WHO acceptable levels with an exception of wasting which was higher than the WHO acceptable levels of under-nutrition
- In the Ethiopean study [^11], illness in the 2 weeks before the survey was conducted was a significant predictor of wasting. 
- ==Solutions for wasting is missing in the research==

## Under-Weight

# Macro Nutrients
*Nutrients that the body requires in large amounts*

 -  A study[^3]  in 4 states in India noted that 
	 - Protein levels were not low (reflected in a study on orphanages in kenya as well [^10] )
	 - Energy intake falling short of RDA (Recommended Dietary Allowances)
	 - 

# Micro Nutrients
*Nutrients that the body requires in small amounts*	
 -  A study[^3]  in 4 states in India noted that :
	 - Common deficiencies from age 6-11 were 
		 - Vitamin A - Bitots Spots
		 - Vitamin B Complex  - Angular Stomatitis

# Eating Behaviors
 - According to a meta analysis[^4]  including children adopted from Romanian orphanages and others, 65% of orphanage children continued to have eating problems even 11 months after adoption :
	 - 1/3 of young children refused to eat solid food
	 - ~1/3 overate, many children never refused food either due to catch up mechanism as a response to malnourishment or because they had never eaten enough food to allow them to learn feelings of satiety. 
- Older children are often fed the same quantity of food as the younger children resulting in lower than required intake [^3]


# Caregiving

## Observations on Caregiver behavior wrt Nutrition
- In some cases in the Ethiopian study [^11] , children were kept unhealthy conditions to appeal to donors and volunteers.
- 
## Caregiver Best Practices
### Meal Prep
- Children's Nutrition and Diet Scale
	- SoPs are to be created and put up [^2], that define the 
		- Minimum Nutritional Standard
		- Special meals on holidays and festivals
		- Special diets for infants and sick children
		- Meal Timings and Daily Menu


### During Meals

- Sitting with the children during meals 
	-  Paying attention to whether children eat properly is critical to noticing eating patterns and in increasing the caregiver : child bond. [^1]
	- 


### Post Meal





# Diagnostic Tools

## WHO standards

- WHO has built a software tool and graphs/tables for field measurements of height to age , weight to age and BMI to age ratios [^5]
	- The tool is more accurate for children below the age of 5
	- For children above the age of 5, a loose reference version of the tool modified by the Indian Pediatrics Association, is available as part of the [Revised IAP Growth Charts for Height, Weight and Body Mass Index for 5 to 18 year old Indian Children](Volume%201/Reference%20Reading/Governments%20&%20UN/IAP/Revised%20IAP%20Growth%20Charts%20for%20Height,%20Weight%20and%20Body%20Mass%20Index%20for%205%20to%2018%20year%20old%20Indian%20Children.md) [^6]  written in 2014
- These tools can be used to assess overall dietary inputs and gaps at a macro level

## CCI Level Assessments
- ==Publicly available micro level tracking tools for nutritional outputs remain to be found==
	- This can be designed with the help of a nutritionist and a pediatrician.
