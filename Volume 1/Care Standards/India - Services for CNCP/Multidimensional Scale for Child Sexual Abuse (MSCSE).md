# Scope
- Multidimensional scale for child sexual abuse (MSCSA): Development and psychometric properties
- In recognition to the rising incidences of child sexual abuse in India, various challenges of existing trauma measures and absence of indigenous efforts at development of comprehensive impact assessment scale, present study was conceptualized.
	-  Objective: To develop and establish psychometric properties of Multidimensional Scale for Children with Sexual Abuse. Participants and 
	- Settings: Outpatient department of government hospitals, non-governmental organizations and child care institutes were primary data setting from which a total of 457 participants were sampled.
	- A recent CSA assessment tool review (Satapathy et al., 2017) revealed that the primary indicators of trauma in most scales are behaviour manifestations and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
	- Participants were included if they were between 7–13 years of age with a history of CSA (as per Protection Of Children against Sexual Offence Act, 2012) from 0 weeks to 2 years with IQ ≥ 90, psychological treatment naïve, ready to give assent and have a consenting parent, caregiver or a legally authorised representative (LRA)
- Emotional experiences vary widely depending on the basic tenets of a culture. For example, socio-centric cultures tended to give rise to a more social feeling of shame after CSA, in contrast to private feeling of guilt in egocentric cultures (Zimmerling, 2003).
	-  Especially, in an Asian country such as India, despite national data indicating a high prevalence of CSA among young children (Kacker et al., 2007), socio-cultural factors (stigma, poor awareness, lack of access to the health care facility, financial difficulties, fear of public exposure upon disclosure and fear of receiving a culturally insensitive response from people) limits timely reporting or treatment-seeking (Gilligan and Akhtar, 2005
- To fulfil the gaps in the literature, Multidimensional Scale for Children with Sexual Abuse (henceforth, referred as MSCSA) has been designed to assess the nature and extent of trauma in children from 7 to 13 years of age with history of sexual abuse
- Mean age of 30 children recruited in pilot group were 10 years and 66 % belonged to upper lower socio-economic status. All children registered a case of penetrative sexual assault under POCSO, in 56 % cases perpetrator was a known person, 24 % were survivors of incest and in 20 % cases, abuse was committed by an unknown person
- # Measurement tools:
	-  [Assessment Tools](Roll%20Ups/Assessment%20Tools.md)
	- Socio-Demographic Performa was constructed for the study consisting of 2 major sections. First, was the personal history regarding a child’s age, gender, **socio-economic status (SES),** and school history. [[Kuppuswamy scale]] was used for SES assessment (Tabassum and Rao, 2017).
	- The second section on **family history** included information on the age, education, and income of parents or head of the family, family history of psychiatric or physical illness, type of family, number of family members, living space, history of substance use, history of other forms of abuse, history of exposure to parental violence or any other significant life events.
		- [[Child PTSD Symptom Scale (CPSS)]] (Foa et al., 2001): CPSS assesses on a 4-point likert scale, the frequency of PTSD symptoms within the past month for a child who has experienced a traumatic event. The scale had satisfactory internal and test-retest reliability along with adequate convergent validity with other PTSD measures. WHO guideline for scale translation was followed to translate the scale into the Hindi language.
		- [[Children’s Impact of Events Scale –13 (CRIES-13)]] (Horowitz et al., 1979): It comprises of 13 items on 4 point likert scale to assesses PTSD symptoms in children between age range of 7–16 years. The scale has satisfactory internal consistency. WHO’s guidelines for scale translation were followed to translate the scale into the Hindi language.
		- [[Developmental Psychopathology Checklist (DPCL)]] (Kapur et al., 1995): DPCL is an Indian adapted version of the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) by Achenbach and Edelbrock, consisting of 6 subsections. In the present study, sub-scale psychopathology was only used.
		- [[Abuse Form]]: The first section included incident information on child’s age at the time of the abuse, frequency of abuse, time since the abuse, and type of abuse. Disclosure information was the second section which included details on time taken for disclosure, threat for disclosure, and sources of support after disclosure.
		- [[Children’s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS)]]: The CGAS is a clinician completed numeric scale ranging from lowest (1) to highest (100)functioning. It captures behavioural descriptors of functioning within the last month for children that is independent of specific mental health diagnosis.
