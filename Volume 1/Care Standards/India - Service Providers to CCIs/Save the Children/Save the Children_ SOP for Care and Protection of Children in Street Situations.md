# Scope
- Children living in street situations has been a reality because of lack of collective and concerted efforts by the civil society organizations, law enforcement agencies, juvenile justice authorities and concerned departments, and also due to lack of convergence and application of laws pertaining to children.
- - “Standard Operating Procedure for Care and Protection of Children in Street Situations 2.0” is an endeavour to strengthen the processes and interventions regarding CiSS in the view that there should not be any child in a street situation; rather, they should be with their families
- - this SOP has been developed based on the learning of the NCPCR while dealing with matters under several domains, including children in conflict with law and CNCP under JJ Act, 2015, rescue of child labour under Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 2016, health and mental health, including substance abuse, and Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009,as well as the implementation of the earlier SOP for the years 2018 and 2019 in four States by Save the Children.
- Save the Children mapped about 2 lakhs children in 10 cities of four States in India, namely, Delhi,Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, whose rights to protection, education, health, water, sanitation,and urban development and welfare were not addressed so far.

# STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) FOR CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN IN STREET SITUATIONS
## Introduction: SOP 2.0
- **Constitutional provisions for children**, provided under the [[Constitution of India]], are affected/contravened when a child is found in street situations. These provisions are as follows: 
	- Article 14: The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India.
	- Article 15(3): Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any special provision for women and children 
	- Article 21: No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law
	- Article 21(A): The State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years in such manner as the State may. 
	- Article 23(1): Traffic in human beings and beggary and other similar forms of forced labour areprohibited and any contravention of this provision shall be an offence punishable in accordance withlaw.
	- Article 24: No child below the age of fourteen years shall be employed to work in any factory or mine or engaged in any other hazardous employment
	- Article 38(1): The State shall strive to promote the welfare of the people by securing and protecting aseffectively as it may a social order in which justice, social, economic and political, shall inform all theinstitutions of the national life
	- Article 39: The State shall, in particular, direct its policy towards securing…(e)…the tender age ofchildren are not abused and that citizens are not forced by economic necessity to enter avocationsunsuited to their age or strength
	- Article 39(f): Children are given opportunities and facilities to develop in a healthy manner and inconditions of freedom and dignity and that childhood and youth are protected against exploitation andagainst moral and material abandonment.
	- Article 45 :The State shall endeavour to provide early childhood care and education for all childrenuntil they complete the age of six years 
- While the **UNCRC** makes no particular reference to CiSS, all its provisions are applicable to them, as are its optional protocols. in CRC’s General Comment No. 21 (2017) on children in street situations, the CRC underlined the wishes of children in street situations, offers key observations on the population, and makes recommendations for States based on a child rights framework.
- The **NPAC, 2016, of the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD)**, takes into account the current priorities for children in India. The focus of the NPAC is to reach and serve to the “Last Child First”, as they are most vulnerable due to gender, socio-cultural and economic or geographic exclusion, including other vulnerable children, such as CiSS, children of migrant workers, children of sex workers and those suffering from HIV/AIDS or other diseases.

## Rationale of the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) :
- JJ Act defines a child in need of care and protection as: “who is found working in contravention of labour laws for the time being in force or is found begging or living on the street”. Thus, CiSS fall under the category of CNCP. 
- when we talk about CiSS in the context of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), goals like “NoPoverty”(SDG No. 1), “Zero Hunger”(SDG No.2”, “Good Health and Well Being”(SDG No. 3), “QualityEducation”(SDG No. 4) and “Clean Water and Sanitation”(SDG No. 6) have been hardly addressed.
- It is pertinent to mention that Principle XII of the JJ Act, 2015 stresses further upon the need to understand that institutionalization of these children shouldbe assumed as the last resort and that every effort shall be inclined towards keeping the child with his/her biological parent or guardian and institutionalization of such CNCP shall be opted for only after exhausting all other available options.

## Life of Children Living in Street Situations (CiSS): Some Issues and Concerns
- The 2018 report of NCRB says that in percentage terms, major crime heads under “Crime against Children” during 2018 were kidnapping and abduction (44.2%); and cases under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 were 34.7%, including child rape.
	- The crime rate per lakh children population was 31.8% in 2018 in comparison to28.9% in 2017.
- proportion of older girls (those in 16–18 years age group) in the street child population is comparatively low as per the data collected by Save the Children, which suggests that various factors drive girls out of streets as they grow older. It could be child marriage, trafficking or entry into the brothels. However, there is a need to conduct an in-depth study on this.
- some of the **reasons why a child leaves the house** are: 
	- “family breakdown, 
	- divorce, 
	- step parenting, 
	- domestic violence, 
	- beating,
	- rebuke,
	- lack of community support, 
	- breakdown of support networks, 
	- lack of parental education about child care and development,
	-  conflict in family and stress management skills by the parents; 
	- assorted family problems including 
		- abuse, 
		- desire for consumer goods,
		-  the lure of the city”, etc.
- Rag-picking is the most commonly cited **livelihood option of CiSS**. Other survival strategies are begging, hawking/street vending and working at roadside stalls. Most street-connected children have to work daily.
- Long working hours, drudgery and exhaustion are the reasons for these children to get attracted to drugs. A substantial proportion of the **children spend a part of their earnings on drugs and intoxicants.** Being on the street also gives them easy access to drugs, alcohol and tobacco, hence substance abuse is a major problem that these children are prone to.
	- According to a study conducted by the NCPCR with National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre, the common drugs of use among children and adolescents are tobacco andalcohol, followed by inhalants and cannabis. 
	- The mean age of onset was lowest for tobacco (12.3 years),followed by onset of inhalants (12.4 years), cannabis (13.4 years) and alcohol (13.6 years), proceeding to the use of harder substances—opium, pharmaceutical opioids, heroin (14.3–14.9 years)—and other substances through injecting route (15.1 years).
	- In another study, 46.36% of slum-dwelling adolescents used both smokeless and smoking tobacco, in addition to alcohol and cannabis, and started using drugs during their childhood itself.
	- Further, a study brought out by the ASSOCHAM Ladies League on “Situational Analysis of Street Children in Metro Cities”, covering 2,000 children, reveals that children in metros are victims of one or other substance use, including inhalants (35%), alcohol (12%), cannabis (16%), chewing tobacco and gutka(16%) and smoking (21%).
- Diarrhoea/loose motions, viral fever and food poisoning are **common illnesses** that are caused and aggravated by consumption of unsafe drinking water, lack of personal hygiene and open defecation. 
	- Most CiSS depend on public sources of water. This includes tap water, hand pumps, wells and water sources at parks, bus stands and railway stations. The CiSS are often more vulnerable to sexual and reproductive health problems, sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortions. It has been seen that sexual and reproductive health problems affect both girls and boys. 
- In addition, the CiSS have a **number of psychological problems** due to insecurity, and continued anxiety, violation and maladjusted behaviour throughout their lives.
- Most of the children **do not have any identification document,** such as birth certificates, and other caste-related or family income certificates, which is the biggest hindrance for children and families in availing benefits of education and other social welfare schemes.
- The term **“street child”,** used by the Commission on Human Rights in 1994, was developed in the 1980s to describe “any girl or boy...for whom the street (in the broadest sense of the word, including unoccupied dwellings, wasteland, etc.) has become his or her habitual abode and/or source of livelihood, and who is inadequately protected, supervised or directed by responsible adults.”
	- At that time, “street children” were categorized as: children on the street, who worked on the street and went home to their families at night; children of the street, who lived on the street, were functionally without family support but maintained family links; or abandoned children who lived completely on their own.
	- The terminology has continued to evolve to recognize children as social actors whose lives are not circumscribed by the street. Human Rights Council Resolution 16/12 refers to children working and/or living on the street, and **the Committee on the Rights of the Child has adopted the term “CiSS”,** recognizing that children engage in numerous activities on the street and that if there is a “problem”, it is not the child butrather the situations in which s/he finds her/himself.

## Definition of Child in Need of Care and Protection
[[Indian Laws]] [[JJ Act]]
Section 2(14) of the JJ Act, 2015 defines child in need of care and protection as a child:
- (i) who is found without any home or settled place of abode and without any ostensible means of subsistence; or
- (ii) who is found working in contravention of labour laws for the time being in force or is found begging, or living on the street; or
- (iii) who resides with a person (whether a guardian of the child or not) and such person—
	- (a) has injured, exploited, abused or neglected the child or has violated any other law for the time being in force meant for the protection of child; or
	- (b) has threatened to kill, injure, exploit or abuse the child and there is a reasonable likelihood of the threat being carried out; or
	- (c) has killed, abused, neglected or exploited some other child or children and there is a reasonable likelihood of the child in question being killed, abused, exploited or neglected by that person; or
	- (iv) who is mentally ill or mentally or physically challenged or suffering from terminal or incurable disease, having no one to support or look after or having parents or guardians unfit to take care, if found so by the Board or the Committee; or
	- (v) who has a parent or guardian and such parent or guardian is found to be unfit or incapacitated, by the Committee or the Board, to care for and protect the safety and well-being of the child; or
	- (vi) who does not have parents and no one is willing to take care of, or whose parents have abandoned or surrendered him; or
	- (vii) who is missing or run away child, or whose parents cannot be found after making reasonable inquiry in such manner as may be prescribed; or
	- (viii) who has been or is being or is likely to be abused, tortured or exploited for the purpose ofsexual abuse or illegal acts; or
	- (ix) who is found vulnerable and is likely to be inducted into drug abuse or trafficking; or
	- (x) who is being or is likely to be abused for unconscionable gains; or
	- (xi) who is child of or affected by any armed conflict, civil unrest or natural calamity; or
	- (xii) who is at imminent risk of marriage before attaining the age of marriage and whose parents, family members, guardian and any other persons are likely to be responsible for solemnization of such marriage.

## Categorization of Children for Appropriate Interventions
- The CiSS may be categorized under three broad types as follows:
	1. Children without support living on the streets all alone:
	2. Children stay on the streets in the day and are back home in the night with their families who reside in a nearby slum/hutments:
	3. Children living on the streets with their families:

## POSSIBLE SCENARIO WHEN A CHILD IS PRODUCED BEFORE THE CWC

### Procedures to be Followed to Ensure Care and Protection of CiSS
- Production of Child before the CWC
	- The principle adopted and reflected in JJ Act, 2015, that any child/children who come under the category of CNCP is to be produced before the CWC, is established under Section 27 of the Act.
	- According to JJ Act, 2015, Section 31(1):
		- Any child in need of care and protection may be produced before the Committee by any of the following persons, namely:—
			- (i)any police officer or special juvenile police unit or a designated Child Welfare Police Officer or any officer of District Child Protection Unit or inspector appointed under any labour law for the time being in force.(This definition is expanded to include the “police beat officer/constable” in urban areas and, as a measure of gatekeeping, can include the chowkidar in the rural set-up. It also includes the Railway Police in this version of the SOP.)
			- (ii)any public servant
			- (iii) Childline Services, or any voluntary or Non-Governmental Organization or any agency as may be recognized by the State Government;
			- (iv) Child Welfare Officer or probation officer;
			- (v)any social worker or a public spirited citizen; or
			- (vi) by the child himself; or
			- (vii) any nurse, doctor or management of a nursing home, hospital or maternity home,
		- Provided that the child shall be produced before the Committee without any loss of time but within a period of twenty-four hours excluding the time necessary for the journey.

### Information, Preparation and Reporting
- **Anybody**, including a spirited citizen, Childline, Child Welfare Police Officer (CWPO), District Child Protection Unit (DCPU), inspector appointed under labour laws, police, social worker, public servant, Child Welfare Officer (CWO), Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) official, nurse, doctor or management of hospital, workers in their official capacity or personal capacity as a spirited citizen having information of CiSS **can produce a child before the concerned CWC, as provided under Section 31(1), or can share the information with Childline-1098 for the same purpose.*
- As provided under Section 30(xii) of the JJ Act, 2015,CWC having information on CiSS under their jurisdiction may reach out to these children(as they are in need of care and protection), who are otherwise not produced before the Committee, with the decision by at least three members
- Based on information for the purpose of producing before the CWC and rehabilitation of CiSS, statutory bodies, like NCPCR, SCPCRs and district child protection mechanism, can constitute teams for conducting survey or adopt any other means to collect information/data on CiSS and carryout rescue operation within the ecosystem created by JJ Act, 2015, as well as other applicable acts and provisions. The concerned CWC must be informed of such operation, which is to be carried out in consultation with the CWC. 
- As provided under Section 31 regarding a public spirited citizen, it may be mentioned that Article 51 of the Constitution of India prescribes the fundamental duties of a citizen to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement. Accordingly, in the context of CiSS, all spirited citizens having information on such children should bring to the notice of police or inform Childline-1098 service forproducing the child before CWC to ensure its care and protection
- In case of a rescue effort, if the number of children rescued is more and transportation/movement isa problem, the CWC may reach out (instead of waiting for the children to be reported to them) to the children so as to ensure their suitable placement.
