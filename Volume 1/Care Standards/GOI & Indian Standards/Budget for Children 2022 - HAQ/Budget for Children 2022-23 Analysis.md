## Major Highlights:

* Children in India receive the lowest share of financial allocations made in the last 11 years.
* Allocations for Welfare of Children, the total allocation for children in Union Budget 2022-23 (BE) is INR 92736.5 Crore against an allocation of INR 85712.56 Crore in the Union Budget 2021-22 (BE).
* Although there is an increase of 8.19 per cent in absolute terms for the overall budget for children in 2022-23, this increase is not proportionate to the increase in the Union Budget.
* 2.35 per cent of the total Union Budget 2022-2023(BE), a reduction of 0.11 percentage points from the share in 2021-22 Union Budget (BE).
* The share of Budget for Children (BfC) is a meager 2.35% - while the overall Union Budget increased by 13.25 per cent in 2022-23, a further reduction in the share of children, especially when the country is battling with COVID-19 situation, is beyond explanation.
* The sectoral share of Child Health, Education and Development continue to receive reduced allocation in the Union Budget 2022-23.
* The share of child protection in the Union Budget 2022-23 observed a minimal increase of **0.01 per cent.**
* Despite the numerous challenges posed by the COVID-19 on school education, the overall budget for child education has seen a decline this year.
* Similar trends can be witnessed for Child Health and Child Development as well.
* Within the Budget for Children (BfC), Child Health and Child Development have seen reduced share of allocation while child education continues to receive the maximum allocation.
* Allocations for Welfare of Children contributions from various Ministries. The Ministry of Women and Child Development has observed a reduced allocation of INR 18858.67 Crore, a significant reduction of 7.56% against 2021-22.
* The 2022-23 Union Budget features a total of 159 programmes/schemes, which is a significant 31 per cent increase in the number of programmes which received attention in the previous budget. Despite allocations for 159 programmes/schemes coming from 24 Departments/Ministries, the share of children in the Union Budget has gone down.
* One of the most important schemes under child health, **NRHM-RCH FlexiPool** has observed a reduced allocation of 8.22 per cent, i.e., INR 3174.57 Crore in Union Budget 2022-23 against an allocation of INR 3459 Crore at BE stage in 2020-21.
* Kalawati Saran Children’s Hospital, one of the largest children’s hospitals in India, received an unchanged allocation of INR 149.44 Crore in Union Budget 2022-23 (BE). This appears to be a mere accounting business, reflecting almost no planning for allocation of resources towards meeting the increased need for investment in child health budget in the times of the pandemic.
* Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 scheme too has observed a reduced allocation of 11.28 per cent with allocations going down from INR 19412.5 Crore in 2021-22 (BE) to INR 17223.61 Crore in Union Budget 2022-23 (BE).
* The National Programme for Mid-Day Meal in Schools has been discontinued and now features a new name - Pradhan Mantri Poshan Shakti Nirman (PM POSHAN). The allocation for the Mid-Day Meal Scheme in the Union Budget 2021-22 (BE) was INR 11500.00, which was reduced  by 11.01 per cent at RE stage. The PM POSHAN scheme covers about 11.80 crore children studying in 11.20 lakh schools across the country. 1Yet, the allocation for PM POSHAN in the Union Budget 2022-23 remains reduced at the same level as the RE for 2021-22.
* Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan has received an increased allocation of 20.40 per cent with total allocation of INR 37383.36 Crore in 2022-23 against INR 31050.16 Crore at BE stage in 2021-22 Union Budget.
* The Education Scheme for Madarsas and Minorities observed a reduced allocation of 8.04 per cent with allocations going down from INR 174 Crore in Union Budget 2021-22 (BE) to INR 160 Crore in Union Budget 2022-23 (BE).
* The budget for the National Child Labour Programme (NCLP) has been drastically reduced by 75 per cent in the Union Budget 2022-23 with a total allocation of INR 30 Crore only. This significant reduction must be seen in the light of year 2021 declared as the International Year for the Elimination of Child Labour by the United Nations General Assembly while acknowledging the magnitude of child labour.
* A significant increase of 63.57 per cent for Mission Vatsalya in the Union Budget 2022-23 is a welcome move. However, it is critical to highlight that the current allocation of INR 1472.17 Crore for Mission Vatsalya is still lower than the allocation of INR 1500 Crore for the Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS) alone in 2020-21, which has been merged under Mission Vatsalya.
* **Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao (BBBP) under SAMBAL component of Mission Shakti: **
    * As per the 5 th report of the Parliamentary Committee on Empowerment of Women dated December 2021, the Ministry of Women and Child Development has earmarked a budget of INR 50 lakh per district for implementation of BBBP, of which 50% (INR 25 lakh) is for awareness and innovation.
    * The scheme is reported to be currently implemented in 405 districts fully with multi-sectoral interventions including advocacy and media campaigns, while the remaining 235 districts out of the total 640 Census districts are covered with a nationwide media campaign.
    * Although, the Committee notes with dismay that out of Rs. 622.48 crore released to the States between 2014-15 and 2019-20, “only 25.13% of the funds, i.e. Rs. 156.46 crore have been spent by the States reflecting not up to the mark performance of the scheme,” the Committee also recommends the government to focus on planned expenditure allocation for sectoral interventions in education and health through BBBP.
    * If this recommendation were to be followed, a budget of INR 320 Crore is required to implement BBBP in the 640 districts fully with multi-sectoral interventions, including awareness.
    * However, the allocation for the entire SAMBAL component of Mission Shakti in the Union Budget 2022-23 is INR 562 Crore, which includes schemes like One Stop Centre, Nari Adalat, Mahila Police Volunteer, Women’s Helpline besides BBBP.
* **Mission Vatsalya and Child Protection**
    * The erstwhile Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS) was merged under Child Protection Services and Child Welfare Services in the Union Budget 2021-22 with a reduction in allocation from INR 1500 Crore in the Union Budget 2020-21 to INR 900 Crore in the Union Budget 2021-22.
    * There is a clear reduction in the budget as Mission Vatsalya receives a total allocation of INR 1472.17 Crore in the Union Budget 2022-23 compared to what ICPS alone received in 2020-21.
* **Saksham Angawadi and Poshan 2.0**
    * The share of children under the Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 scheme has observed a reduced allocation of of 11.28 per cent with allocations going down from INR 19412.5 Crore in 2021-22 (BE) to INR 17223.61 Crore in Union Budget 2022-23 (BE).
    * The scheme includes the Umbrella ICDS, Poshan Abhiyan and Scheme for Adolescent Girls, a miniscule increase of 0.8 per cent cannot address the nutrition issues of children under six years, adolescent girls and pregnant and lactating mothers etc. 

## Child Health [[Physical Health]] 

* The allocation for Child Health has decreased by 6.08 per cent with allocations going down from INR 3727.57 Crore in 2021-22 to INR 3501.11 Crore in Union Budget 2022-23.
* The overall allocation for Child Health (under the allocation for Department of Health and Family Welfare/ Demand No. 46), has gone down by 6.01 per cent.
* One of the important components “NRHM-RCH Flexi Pool”, has seen a major setback in terms of reduced allocations in the Union Budget 2022-23.
* The National Health Policy, 2017 envisaged an increase in government’s health expenditure to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2025.
* The budgeted expenditure of the Central and State Governments on the health sector has made slow progress and has reached 2.1 per cent of GDP in 2021-22, against 1.8 per cent in 2020-21. 2At this juncture, attention needs to be drawn to the fact India’s out of pocket expenditure on health continues to remain the highest in the world with almost 50% expenditure met by people themselves.
* While there is much to applaud with respect to achievements made on certain health indicators as per the NFHS-5, there are also issues of serious concern, which can be attributed to both, decline in budgetary allocation towards children’s health and nutrition schemes as well as the slowdown in economic growth.
* There are large inter-state variations in Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR), Under-five Mortality Rate (U5MR), Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) and Sex Ratio at Birth (SRB), the four key Health Outcome indicators.
* According to ‘Levels and Trends in Child Mortality’, a report by the United Nations (UN) inter-agency group for child mortality, in 2018, the under-5 mortality rate for girls exceeded that for boys.
* Malnutrition is a significant factor for under-five mortality, especially for girls in India. It remains 8.3 percent higher for girls than for boys as per NFHS-5.
* The NFHS-5 data also shows that 16 out of the 22 States and Union Territories surveyed registered a rise in the percentage of under-five children who are underweight and severely wasted.
* 13 out of 22 states have witnessed a reversal in stunting outcomes, recording a rise in the percentage of children under five years who are stunted in comparison to 2015- 16.
* ‘Adolescents, Diets and Nutrition: Growing Well in a Changing World’ a 2019 report by UNICEF and NITI Aayog based on the Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS) point to the multiple nutritional deprivations suffered by adolescent girls.
* According to the report, while more girls compared to boys suffer from shortness, anaemia affects 40% of adolescent girls, compared to 18% of boys, and worsens as they get older.
* Although the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Government of India has launched the Anemia Mukt Bharat Programme for accelerating decline in anemia prevalence and to achieve the POSHAN Abhiyaan (2018-20) target of reducing prevalence of anemia among children aged 6-59 months, adolescents and women of reproductive age 15-49 years by 3 percentage points per year, 4the implementation remains tardy.

Anaemia Mukt Bharat Scorecard [Assessment Tools](Roll%20Ups/Assessment%20Tools.md)
**A Glimpse into the Realities of Anaemia Mukt Bharat:**

* AMB program is yet to be launched in 18 States and UTs.
* Functional digital hemoglobinometer yet to be procured in 23 States.
* Printed IEC material to frontline workers yet to be distributed in 21 States.
* Conversation with fluorosis, National vector borne disease control program, hemoglobinopathies division still not established in many States.
* Community Testing of water in fluorosis identification, blood testing for hemoglobinopathy still not established in many endemic districts.
* Digital platform for stock inventory like dvdms up to block level yet to be established in 21 States.
* HMIS district headquarter report (IFA coverage and stock reporting) still an issue in complete reporting, 474 districts reported out of total of 726 districts
* NFHS-5 also reveals that children’s access to healthcare services, when suffering from diarrhea and symptoms of acute respiratory infection (ARI), has remained almost the same since the NFHS-4.
* The Economic Survey 2021-22 attempts to glorify and applaud the health expenditure against the GDP, it must be borne in mind that we are looking at serious issues of uniformity in achieving the SDG targets among all the States and Union Territories and reducing gender disparities.


## Child Education [[Education]]  
* Allocation for child education in the Union Budget 2022-23 has increased by 15.04 per cent in absolute terms with a total allocation of INR 69835.72 Crore at BE stage.
* The share of child education in the overall Union Budget 2022-23 has witnessed only a marginal increase of 0.3 percentage points (from 1.74% in 2021-22 to 1.77% in 2022-23).
* The major increase in the Education Budget can be attributed to a 20.40 per cent increase in the allocation for Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan.
* Since the launch of SMSA, the scheme has faced a major setback in shortfall of funds i.e. differences between the approved budget and allocated budget.
* composite grants under Samagra Shiksha are provided for conducive learning environment including construction of separate girls’ toilets, the Parliamentary Committee on Empowerment of Women notes that although the UDISE data claims availability of 95.4% toilets for girls in schools, their actual usability with running water and doors which can be secured from inside is what counts. Lack of functional toilets in schools is the major reason for drop out of girls as toilets play an important role in creating a safe and hygienic school environment, especially for girl students.
* The Ministry of Education does not have any specific data on the adverse impact of prolonged school closures on children and the digital divide created by the pandemic.
* India is one of the countries across the globe to have undergone the longest period of school closures. 
* The Indian education system also saw the largest disruption in history affecting nearly 32 Crore students’ population enrolled in various schools/colleges and universities.
* Around 320 million children in India have not stepped into a classroom for more than a year and have lost a tenth of their entire schooling already.
* With passing time and continued cessation of classes, especially at school level, learning loss was widening and acquiring critical dimensions.
* The Finance Minister announced expansion of the 'One class, one TV channel' program from 12 to 200 TV channels so as to enable all states to provide supplementary education in regional languages for classes 1 to 12.
    * “Locked Out: Emergency report on School Education”  based on a survey of children and parents from 1400 households suggests that “only 1% of rural children and 8% of urban children in our sample acknowledged TV programmes as a regular or even occasional mode of study.” 46% children in urban areas and 43% in rural areas find online classes/videos difficult to follow.
    * Only 33.8% students, 29.6% teachers and 27.2% parents found it joyful, whereas 26.4% students, 15.7% teachers and 25% parents found it difficult. 
    * In terms of identifying difficulties in various subjects, mathematics, sciences and social sciences emerged as the subjects of concern.
    * In terms of use of devices, mobiles were being used by the students in highest percentage, i.e., 84 per cent followed by laptops (19.4%), television (5.5%) and radio (0.6%).
    * Almost 70% children in India go to government schools for their education, which lack even the basic infrastructure as compared to KVs and has thus suggested rethinking on the ways to reduce the learning gaps as only online mediums will not be able to bridge the existing learning gaps
    * The report,“Locked Out: Emergency report on School Education” suggests that only 9% of all SCHOOL children had their own smartphone and poor connectivity and lack of money for “data” are some of the challenges they face in accessing online classes.
    * 57% children in urban areas and 65% in rural areas have reported connectivity problems.
* The Pre Matric Scholarship for SCs and Others under the aegis of Department of Social Justice and Empowerment has received a reduced allocation of 31.03 per cent (from INR 725 Crore in 2021-22 to INR 500 Crore in 2022-23) in the Union Budget 2022-23.
* The Education Scheme for Madarsas and Minorities too has observed a reduced allocation of 8.04 per cent with allocations going down from INR 174 Crore in Union Budget 2021-22 (BE) to INR 160 Crore in Union Budget 2022-23 (BE). 
* Such budget cuts are bound to increase the digital divide in education in the current times besides causing a general setback to many children belonging to the marginalized sections of society.
* There is a welcome increase of 41.03 per cent towards allocation for the Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRs) in Union Budget 2022-23. 
    * As per the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, a total of 652 EMRs have been sanctioned, out of which only 367 EMRs are functional. 
    * EMRs have been established in 102 sub-districts having tribal populations and it is targeted to establish EMRs in the remaining 462 sub-districts by the year 2022.
    * In the Budget Speech of 2021-22, the Finance Minister had promised a target of 750 EMRs.
    * If the remaining 285 EMRs which are yet to be made functional and the construction cost of one EMR (which is INR 20 Crore) are to be taken into account, then the current allocation falls short on the actual requirement and target.
* The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) has approved the continuation of ‘National Scheme for PM POSHAN in Schools’ 12 for the five-year period 2021-22 to 2025- 26 with the financial outlay of INR 54061.73 Crore from the Central Government and INR 31,733.17 Crore from State Governments & UT Administrations.
* Central Government will also bear an additional cost of about INR 45,000 Crore on foodgrains. Therefore, the total scheme budget will amount to INR 1,30,794.90 Crore over a period of five years.
* Effectively, 2022-23 is the first year of PM POSHAN and what it receives in the very first year of its implementation is only 7.8 per cent of the total financial outlay, thus posing a question on the implementation and coverage of the scheme.
* Launch of “A national tele mental health programme”:
    * As per the Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India 13report of the NCRB, suicides by students comprise 8.2% to total suicides in the year 2020.
    * ‘Failure in Examination’ accounts for 1.4% of all suicides.
    * Of the females who committed suicides, highest number (22,372) was of house-wives followed by students (5,559).


## Child Development  [[Roll Ups/Nutrition/Nutrition]] [[Roll Ups/Assessment Tools]]

* The overall budget for Child Development programmes as a part of the Union Budget 2022-23 accounts for an allocation of INR 17826.03 Crore.
* Child Development programmes, which largely include nutrition and day care related programmes for children under 6 years that used to be part of the Umbrella ICDS scheme, have seen a reduced allocation of 10.97 per cent in the 2022-23 Union Budget.
* The major allocation within the Child Development programme has been towards ‘Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0’ with an allocation of INR 17223.61 Crore.
* The major allocation within the Child Development programme has been towards ‘Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 (erstwhile Anganwadi services) has however, received a blow with allocation reducing by 11.28 per cent against the 2021-22 budget at BE stage.
* The Centre and State Governments and UT administrations need to be reminded of the order of the Supreme Court dated 27 March, 2020 where the court had expressed concern over large-scale malnourishment resulting from non-supply of nutritional food to children as well as lactating and nursing mothers with the schools and Anganwadis shutting down during the lockdown.
* According to World Vision’s India Child Well-being Report 2020, almost 115 million children are at the risk of malnutrition due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown.
* Another study points out that five million children are at risk of falling in the wasting category of malnourishment, while an additional two million children are at risk of being pushed into the severe wasting category due to the pandemic. The study concludes that with “high concentration of children around the undernutrition threshold, any minor shock to nutritional health of the children can have major implications.”
* At this stage, it is pertinent to deconstruct the allocations made for Saksham Anganwadi Scheme and Poshan 2.0 as both the components are crucial for eliminating malnutrition among children.
* The GoI is implementing POSHAN Abhiyan, earlier known as National Nutrition Mission, since 18th December 2017 to address the problem of malnutrition in the country. The Abhiyan aims to reduce malnutrition in the country in a phased manner, through a life cycle approach, by adopting a synergised and result oriented approach. To ensure a holistic approach, all districts of States/UTs have been covered in the Abhiyan. Target is to bring down stunting of the children in the age group of 0-6 years from 38.4% to 25% by the year 2022.16. 
* **What is Needed for Effective Implementation of the Integrated Child Development Services/ Saksham Anganwadis**
* An evaluation of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme was undertaken by Niti Aayog in collaboration with the Institute of Economic Growth and IIT Gandhinagar in nine States and Union Territories to understand specifically the governance and implementation mechanisms and key processes under the ICDS scheme. The evaluation report was shared with MoWCD.
-  Some of the key recommendations centred around:
	* Streamlining the governance and monitoring mechanisms for supplementary nutrition to ensure greater efficacy and impact of the allocated resources.
	* ICDS’s take-home ration and hot-cooked meals should adopt a progressive view to promote dietary diversity and coverage.
	* ICDS should evolve as per the changing needs and aspirations of the community, particularly in the urban areas where households are drawn towards an increasingly vibrant pre-schooling environment.
	* The quality of Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD) is thus emerging as a major parameter to sustain the relevance of ICDS.
	* Gaps and inadequacies in ICDS financing, infrastructure and human resources have detrimental effects on service delivery and require renewed attention.

## Child Protection
[Child Safety](Roll%20Ups/Child%20Safety/Child%20Safety.md)
* Child protection has been one of the least prioritized sectors in terms of resource allocation over the years. 
* In 2022-23, child protection has received **only 0.04 per cent **of the **total Union Budget.**
* The overall allocation for Child Protection remains at INR 1573.82 Crore.
* Although the current allocation for child protection is an increase of 44.72 per cent in absolute terms, this increase must be examined in the context of rising child protection concerns. 
* In the 2019-20 Union Budget, the total allocation for the Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS) was INR 1500 Crore. As we moved ahead, the total allocation for the overall child protection sector is a little more than INR 1500 Crore.
* Child line India Foundation, revealed that during the lockdown period (between the months of June to October) there had been an increase of more than 33% in the number of child marriages as compared to 2019. The month of August alone witnessed an increase of more than 88%.
* Online trafficking for child labour and sex increased during the Covid-19 crisis.
* Data from states such as Jharkhand suggest that the number of children trafficked increased by over 600 % in April and May, 2020 when compared to the same two months in 2019. 
* According to Patna’s Centre DIRECT, 362 children were rescued in 2020 and another 136 have been rescued so far in 2021 — all working in factories of Jaipur. The average age of these children was 10 years.
* As per the NCRB crime statistics for 2020, among offenses under the IPC:
    * 1st - Kidnapping and Abduction of children has the highest number of cases (54,785 out of 77,382)
    * 2nd -  Insult to the Modesty of Women (8199 out of 77,382)
    * 3rd - Assault on women with intent to outrage her modesty (4110 out of 77,382).
    * Within SLL crimes, the share of cases under the POCSO Act is the highest [47,221 out of 51,149 or 92.3%].
* It is now an admitted fact that **child labour has seen an upward trend** during the COVID times as there are enough evidences to show that many children had to drop out from school to support their families.
* The policy makers can also not shy away from the phenomena of witnessing children headed households.
* The ILO and UNICEF report warns that globally, 9 million additional children are at risk of being pushed into child labour by the end of 2022 as a result of the pandemic. A simulation model shows this number could rise to 46 million if they don’t have access to critical social protection coverage.
* According to UNICEF India, more than 1.5 billion children in India missed out on their schooling due to COVID-19 restrictions.
* Aide et Action’s study in India on the impact of COVID-19 on migrant children revealed a two-fold increase in the number of children who accompanied their working parents to the brick-making industry after the first wave COVID-19 pandemic.
* Yet there is a massive reduction of 75 per cent towards the National Child Labour Programme in the Union Budget 2022-23, which cannot be justified.
* INR 1472.17 Crore for Mission Vatsalya, which is in fact lesser than the allocation of INR 15000 Crore for the Integrated Child Protection Services in 2019-20 Union Budget, will be nowhere near to meet the child protection challenges
