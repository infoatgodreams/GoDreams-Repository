**Scope:** 
- This is Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Hirabai Cowasji Jehangir Medical Research Institute, Jehangir Hospital, Pune, Maharashtra, India.
-  Basics of growth charts and importance of anthropometric measurements are described. 
- A comparison between growth standards and references is provided. Further, Indian growth reference curves based on the data collected by Agarwal et al. and adopted by the Indian Academy of Pediatrics, World Health
- Organization growth standards for children under the age of 5 years (2006) and contemporary Indian growth references published on apparently healthy affluent Indian children (data collected in 2007-08) are discussed.

- **What are growth charts and how to read them**
	- For the assessment of height, weight and BMI, WHO growth standards (for children < 5 years) and contemporary cross sectional reference percentile curves (for children from 5-18 years) are available for clinical use and for research purposes. BMI percentiles (adjusted for the Asian adult BMI equivalent cut-offs) for the assessment of physical growth of present day Indian children are also available.
		- LMS values and Microsoft excel macro for calculating SD scores can be obtained from the author (email: vamankhadilkar@gmail.com). Contemporary growth charts can be obtained by sending a message to 08861201183 or email: gntd@novonordisk.com.
	- The previously available growth reference curves in India were based on the data collected by Agarwal et al. in 1989 which were published in 1992 and 1994 and were then adopted by the Indian Academy of Pediatrics for growth monitoring in 2007.
	- Standard growth chart has 7 percentile lines and include 3rd, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 97th percentiles. These percentiles are standard for height and weight charts. Any individual who is below 3rd and above 97th percentile is considered out of normal range. 
		- For the BMI charts, however, there are 85th and 95th percentile lines which indicate overweight and obesity cut offs.
		- Proportion charts use Z score lines instead of percentile lines and discrepancy of more than 2Z scores in the upper and lower segment is considered abnormal
		- On the growth velocity chart, 25th percentile is the cut off line for defining low height velocity.
		-  The correlation between Z scores and percentiles can be confusing and in the recent WHO Multicenter Growth Reference (MGRS) 2006 study, these correlations have been spelt out by the WHO	
- Growth charts mainly belong to two types: growth standards and growth references. Growth standards are prescriptive and define how a population of children should grow given the optimal nutrition and optimal health. Growth references on the other hand are descriptive and are prepared from a population which is thought to be growing in the best possible state of nutrition and health in a given community. These describe the growth of children at that time. They represent how children are growing rather than how they should be growing.
	- WHO 2006 growth charts for children under 5 years is an example of growth standards. They delineate how children of the world under the age of 5 years should grow if most of the controllable variables are kept optimal as opposed to this 1989 Agarwal et al.,[3] data and 2007 Indian growth charts by Khadilkar et al.,[7] for affluent children are an example of growth references which describe how children in India were growing at the given time.
	- Advantage of having a growth standard such as WHO 2006 charts is that children of all countries, races, ethnicity can be compared against a single standard thus assessment becomes more objective and easy to compare. 
	- The disadvantage of using charts such as these is that they are likely to over diagnose underweight and stunting in a large number of apparently normal children[8] in the developing countries such as India.
	- Advantage of a reference is that they are true representative of the existing growth pattern of children and allow us to study the secular trend in terms of height, weight, and obesity. The downside of reference curves is that they need to be updated at least once in a decade and in modern times as obesity is on the rise they are likely to define overweight children as normal
- WHO recommends using -2Z (3rd percentile) scoresfor diagnosis of stunting and underweight and -3Z(1st percentile) for the diagnosis of severe stunting and severe underweight. 
- Use of WHO 2006 growth charts are likely over diagnosed stunting or underweight or both in developing countries. [[Stunting]]
	-  In a recent multicentric study done on 1493 affluent preschool Indian children (selected from all zones of India) published by the author the Mean Z scores for height, weight, BMI,and weight for height (-0.75(1.1), -0.59(1.1), –0.19(1.22) and -0.26(1.18), respectively) were below the WHO 2006 standards. The overall incidence of stunting was 13.6% andunderweight was 8.5% amongst affluent Indian children under the age of five years. 
	- This percentage is likely to behigher in rural areas and in under privileged urban areasalthough at the present time no such data is available fromIndia.
