## Introduction

For millions of children worldwide, childhood has ended too soon. The major reasons include: 

1.  ill health
2. Malnutrition
3. exclusion from education
4. child labor
5. child marriage
6. early pregnancy
7. conflict and extreme violence.

This report examines the many factors that rob children of their childhoods and reveals where greater investments are needed to save children from poverty, discrimination and neglect. **THE END OF CHILDHOOD INDEX:** compares the latest data for 186 countries and assesses where the most and fewest children are missing out on childhood.


### Highlights

* **Singapore and Slovenia** top the ranking this year with scores of 990 out of 1,000.
* 8 Western European countries rank in the top 10, attaining very high scores for children’s health, education and protection status. 
* Niger ranks last among the countries surveyed, scoring 392.
* The 10 bottom-ranked countries are all from sub-Saharan Africa. Children in these countries are the least likely to fully experience childhood, a time that should be dedicated to emotional, social and physical development, as well as play.
* The United States badly trails nearly all other advanced countries in helping children reach their full potential. The U.S. score of 948 puts it at least 25 points behind most Western European countries. Countries with similar scores include Bahrain, China, Montenegro, Qatar, Russia and Slovakia.
* It should be noted that data in the End of Childhood Index are almost all from years prior to COVID-19, so they provide a baseline for how the world’s children were doing before the pandemic hit.
* The rankings reflect where children are most likely to experience extreme poverty and inadequate safety nets. These children are the world’s most vulnerable. As such, they are particularly unable to withstand the additional assaults to their well-being that COVID introduces: intensified poverty, increased hunger, reduced health care and schooling, and the diminished presence of caring, healthy adults in their lives. 1
* The End of Childhood Index may be used as a **tool to help decision-makers target investments to children** who are most in need of care, protection and special services that allow them to overcome the compounding disadvantages they face when the effects of chronic marginalization and COVID interact.


## What do the scores mean? 

End of Childhood Index scores for countries are calculated on a scale of 1 to 1,000. The scores measure the extent to which children in each country experience **“childhood enders” such as death, chronic malnutrition, being out of school and being forced into adult roles of work, marriage and motherhood.**

Here’s a quick guide on how to interpret country scores:
* 940 or above – Few children missing out on childhood 
* 760 to 939 – Some children missing out on childhood 
* 600 to 759 – Many children missing out on childhood 
* 380 to 599 – Most children missing out on childhood 
* 379 or below – Nearly all children missing out on childhood

## Convention on the rights of the child

- Every child has a right to childhood. The concept of childhood is defined in the **Convention on the Rights of the Child**. It represents a shared vision of childhood: healthy children in school and at play, growing strong and confident with the love and encouragement of their family and an extended community of caring adults, gradually taking on the responsibilities of adulthood, free from fear, safe from violence, protected from abuse and exploitation. 
- Footnote on Convention on the Rights of the Child: Childhood means more than just the time between birth and adulthood. It refers to the state and condition of a child’s life – to the quality of those years. 
	- As the most widely endorsed human rights treaty in history, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1989 and ratified by all but one country, represents a global consensus on the terms of childhood. 
	- Although there is no absolute agreement on the interpretation of each and every provision of the Convention, there is substantial common ground on what the standards of childhood should be. Source: UNICEF. The State of the World’s Children 2005


## Childhood Enders
* This index does not capture the full extent of deprivations or hardships affecting children. 
	* It focuses on some key rights or “guarantees” of childhood: life, healthy growth and development, education and protection from harm. 
	* If a child experiences all of these, his/her childhood is considered to be “intact.”
- The index tracks a series of events that, should any one of them occur, mark the end of an intact childhood. 
	- These events are called “childhood enders” and include:
		- child dies
		- malnutrition permanently impairs a child's development [[Roll Ups/Nutrition/Nutrition]]
		- child leaves or fails to enter school [Education](Roll%20Ups/Education/Education.md)
		- child begins work life
		- child marries
		- child has a child
		- and child is a victim of extreme violence [Child Safety](Roll%20Ups/Child%20Safety/Child%20Safety.md)

- Depending on the number and severity of enders experienced, the loss of childhood could be complete or only partial. But once a child experiences an ender, childhood becomes fractured rather than complete. Each event represents an assault on childhood. At some point, as the assaults mount up, childhood ends.

- Countries are scored and ranked according to performance across this set of enders, revealing where childhood is most and least threatened.\
	- **ENDER:** Child dies  - **INDICATOR:** Under-5 mortality rate
	- **ENDER:** Child is severely malnourished  - **INDICATOR:** Child stunting (%)
	- **ENDER: **Child is out of school - **INDICATOR:** Out-of-school children, adolescents and youth (%)
	- **ENDER:** Child begins work life - **INDICATOR:** Child labor (%)
	- **ENDER:** Child marries - **INDICATOR**: Adolescents currently married or in union (%)
	- **ENDER:** Child has a child -**INDICATOR:** Adolescent birth rate
	- **ENDER:** Child is a victim of extreme violence - **INDICATOR:** Population forcibly displaced by conflict (%)
	- **ENDER**: Child is a victim of extreme violence -  **INDICATOR**: Child homicide rate


### Indicators, Definitions and Data Sources
[Child Safety](Roll%20Ups/Child%20Safety/Child%20Safety.md)
- The following eight indicators were selected because they best represent these enders, are available for a large number of countries and are regularly updated. 

1. **Under-5 mortality rate (U5MR):** The probability of dying between birth and exactly 5 years of age, expressed per 1,000 live births. Estimates are for 2019. **Child stunting (moderate and severe)**: % of children aged 0-59 months who are below minus two standard deviations from median height-for-age of the [WHO Child Growth Standards](https://www.who.int/tools/child-growth-standards). [WHO Child Growth Standards](Volume%201/Care%20Standards/International%20-%20Govts,%20UN%20&%20World%20Bodies/WHO/WHO_Growth%20reference%20for%20school%20aged%20children%20and%20adolescents.md) [Child Safety](Roll%20Ups/Child%20Safety/Child%20Safety.md)
2. **Out-of-school rate for children, adolescents and youth of primary and secondary school age (OOSC)**: The number of children, adolescents and youth of official primary and secondary school age who are not enrolled in primary, secondary or higher levels of education, expressed as a percentage of the population of official school age. Children and young people (about ages 6 and over) who are enrolled in pre-primary education are considered to be out of school. [Education](Roll%20Ups/Education/Education.md)
3. **Child labor:** % of children 5-17 years old involved in child labor. 
    A child is considered to be involved in child labor under the following conditions:
        1. 5-11 year olds - who did at least 1 hour of economic work or at least 28 hours of household chores
        2. 12-14 year olds - who did at least 14 hours of economic work or at least 28 hours of household chores
        3. 15-17 year olds - who did at least 43 hours of economic work or household chores.
4. **Adolescents currently married or in union**:Percentage of girls 15-19 years of age who have been married and are not either divorced, widowed or separated. Estimates are for 2018 for all but the three countries with supplemental data.  
5. **Adolescent birth rate**: Births to women aged 15-19 per 1,000 women in that age group. Estimates are for 2018 for all but the three countries with supplemental data. **Population forcibly displaced by conflict or persecution**: Total population of concern to UNHCR,9by country or territory of origin, expressed as a percentage of the country’s or territory’s population. 
6. **Evidence of child soldiers**: Countries identified as having governmental armed forces, government-supported armed groups or other parties that recruit or use child soldiers. The term “child soldier” includes children who are serving in any capacity, including in a support role, such as a cook, porter, messenger, medic, guard or sex slave.

7. **Child homicide rate:** Estimated number of deaths caused by interpersonal violence among children and adolescents aged 0-19 years (from WHO), expressed per 100,000 popula- tion in that age group (from UNDESA, Population Division). Estimates are for 2016. Sources: WHO.

### Calculations
[Assessment Tools](Roll%20Ups/Assessment%20Tools.md) 

As indicators are measured on different scales, each was first normalized using a linear scaling technique:
XN= (X – Worst)/(Best – Worst)

Where:
X N is the normalized value X is the actual value Worst is the highest observed value for the indicator Best is the lowest possible value for the indicator

This technique ensures scores range between 0 and 1 and that all indicators are coded positively (i.e., higher scores indicate better performance).10

All indicators are weighted equally. The overall index score was calculated by summing across the normalized scores for each indicator and then dividing by eight. Scores were multi- plied by 1,000 and rounded to three digits. Countries were sorted from high to low by this overall index score (with 1,000 being the best possible score) and then ranked from 1 to 186. 

To help ensure index scores are comparable from year to year and that countries can track progress over time, the best i.e., minimum) and worst (i.e., maximum) values and the indicator weights have been fixed from the inaugural year onwards as shown in the table.  (page 10)

#### Missing Values

* Countries missing violence data were dropped from the ranking. Countries missing up to any two of the other six indicators were allowed to remain in the index. This was the only way to ensure a sufficient number of high-income OECD countries were included, as most do not collect or publish data on stunting or child labor.
* In total, 186 countries had sufficient data to be ranked. 106 countries have data for all eight indicators. 35 countries are missing one indicator. 45 countries are missing two indicators, 39 of which are high-income countries. For countries lacking stunting, out-of-school or child labor data, the normalized score for their under-5 mortality rate was used in place of the missing value(s). 
* Under-5 mortality is the leading indicator of child well-being and is strongly correlated with these three indicators. .
* For countries lacking child marriage data, the normalized score for their adolescent birth rate was ascribed. These two indicators are also highly correlated.
* Syria’s score for displacement is the only exception. Because this year’s estimate (74.5%) exceeds the “worst” possible score of 65.4, Syria’s normalized score is actually negative (-0.14).

#### Prevalence thresholds and performance bands

Countries with “moderate,” “high” or “very high” prevalence of enders were color-coded as shown in tables on page 10 & page 11. Countries were placed into one of 5 bands according to their index score.

#### Country Classification

The End of Childhood Index presents data for the world as a whole and for various country groupings. These groupings are based on UNICEF’s nomenclature and regional classification. For a list of countries and territories in each region, see: **UNICEF, The State of the World’s Children 2016** 

#### Limitations & Caveats

- This index focuses only on the most significant enders for which reliable and comparable data are widely available. 
	- Some indicators (e.g., sexual violence, trafficking, hazardous work) would have been included had there been sufficient data. 
	- Others (e.g., incarceration, **orphanhood,** migration, bullying, corporal punishment, substance use) had data but weren’t included because **they do not necessarily – in and of themselves – signal the end of childhood.** 
	- **A child who is incarcerated, for example, can receive substantial rehabilitation services including counseling, schooling and a reliable network of caring adults**. 

- Many potential indicators (e.g., child abuse) were also discarded due to data quality concerns or because they were not the most relevant indicator for the ender in question (e.g., suicide for child dies).

- This does not mean that children who experience enders are not still children or that they cannot still enjoy some aspects of childhood. 
	- A child who is out of school, for example, may still learn other skills at home.
	- Refugee children still play and may study if the right policies and programs are in place.
	- And even though they have taken on adult roles and responsibilities, child brides and teen mothers are still children entitled to protection and support.
