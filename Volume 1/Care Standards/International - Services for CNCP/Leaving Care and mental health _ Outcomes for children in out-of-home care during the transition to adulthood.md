Leaving care and mental health: outcomesfor children in out-of-homecare during the transition to adulthood

There were 59,500 Children in out-of-homecare in England in 2008. Researchinto this population points to poor health and quality oflife outcomes over the transition to adult independence.

Although the precise reasons for these poor outcomesare unclear long term outcomesfrom national birth cohorts suggest that mental health could be a key predictor for subsequent psychosocial adjustment.

This paper delineates the estimated prevalence of mental health problems for adolescents in the care system, organisational factors, influencing service provision, and pathways through thetransition from adolescence to independent young adultlife.

Children in voluntary or court ordered out-of-home care are referred to differentially between countries and in the literature. In this paper they will be referred to as Children in Care (CIC))

It has been further argued, from Australian studies that, &quot;Children and youth residing awayfrom their parents in court-ordered care represent one of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in Western society. Their mental health problems are complex and exceptional for a non-clinical population.

a 2002 report commissioned by the Office for National Statistics on behalf of the Departmentof Health reported that approximately half (45%) of CIC, and almost three quarters (72%) of those in residential care, were clinically diagnosed with a mental disorder

In the UK, approximately 10% of children 5-16 years old are diagnosed with a mental disorder

In the U.K., government guidelines from Every Child Matters suggest promoting five indicators that reflect mental capital: be healthy; stay safe; enjoy and achieve; make a positive contribution; and achieve economic wellbeing [5]. These indicators could be used to examine outcomesfrom the care system[5].

the abstract for the World Health Organisation's 2008 document declares: &quot;Children are our investment in tomorrow's society. Their health and the way in which we nurture them through adolescence into adulthood will affect the prosperity andstability of countries in the European Region over the coming decades.”

Standard 4 of the National Service Frameworkfor Children, Young People and Maternity Services adulthood. [18] The is standard concerned reads: with &quot;All growing young into people [should] have access to age-appropriate services which are responsive to their specific needs as they grow into adulthood.”

the disadvantaged private household sample and 8.5% of the non-disadvantaged private household sample.

Mental Health of Children in Care &quot;Many children come in and out of care and manyof those who remain in care frequently change placements. The prevalence of childhood mental disorders tended to decrease with the length of time in their current placement..... The overall rate fell from 49% of those in their current placementfor less than a year to 31% of children in their current placementfor at least five years.&quot; [2]

Barth, Wildfire and Green[[23]; USA] report on thedifficulty of determining whether children whoenter the child welfare system are from families who are desperately poor or unfit or whether they are entering the child welfare system in order to access mental health services and placements that would be otherwise unavailable to them. They estimate that up to 20% of CIC may have entered due to lack of mental health services and these children, who do not have an unfit parent, are mostlikely to be in group care.

Mostchildren whoenterthe care system,in the UK,are placed short-term andwill not remain in the system up to their sixteenth birthday, but will be discharged again to the care of their parents with 70% of children being discharged home within a year

Pecora [[24]; USA] also makes the case for high quality mental health services by reviewing a numberof studies in the U.S.A. whichall indicate rates of behavioural problems of up to 50% for children, over the age of 11 years, entering the child welfare system.

The care population therefore is not a stable group and an assessment of their mental health on entry to care is not routine.

Tarren-Sweeney [[3]; New Zealand] reviewing the research into mental health problems of pre-adolescent children in care also finds that their mental health problems moreclosely resemble clinic-referred than normative samples. Children in residential care have been found to have more mental health problemsthan those in family-type foster care, with kinship placements recording the least problems.

Dimigen, Del Priore, Butler, Evans, Ferguson and Swan [21] assessed the mental health of children, aged 5-12 (n = 89), coming into care in Glasgow, Scotland. Taking measurements within six weeks of admission to care, more than 30% had elevated levels of mental disorders including conduct disorder, depression, attention deficit hyperactive disorder, autism and anxiety. The most common disorders identified were conduct disorders (28%) and depression (28%).

standard caregiver-report rating scales primarily the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Rutter scales

Studies have estimated a high prevalence of DSM-III-R and DSM-IV conductdisorder (17-45%), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (10-30%), depression (4-26%) among mixed samples of children and youth in foster and residential care (13-16). The variability in estimated rates is probably more a consequence of differences in study design, than in the populationsselected.&quot;

Ford, Vostanis, Meltzer and Goodman [[22]; UK] examined the socio-demographic characteristics and psychopathology, by type of placement, of children cared for by local authorities (CIC; n = 1,453). They comparedthese children with deprived and non-deprived children living in private homes(n = 10,428). Forty six per cent of CIC had at least one psychiatric diagnosis as compared to 15% of

Age on Entry to the Care System Children entering care in adolescence appearless responsive to changesin parenting style.

Possibly the relational difficulties of late-placed children are moreresistant to therapeutic change in spite of a positive environment.

Cashmore and Paxman [[25]; Australia, n = 47] found that retrospectively measured perceived security was associated with positive outcomes for young adults after they left care.

The issue of identifying when to bring in expertise from other agencies is also reported by Pentecost and Woodsurveying 440 child care social workers concerning their knowledge and perception of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) where approximately 30% of the social workers were unawareoflocal resources that might support these children and families [30].

‘felt’ security is a nonstandardised scale adapted from Schofields' framework of a sense of belonging andfelt security

Tarren-Sweeney [[27]; n = 347] reports on a retrospective and concurrent study which identifies age of reception into care and also the perceived or actual sense of security in their placements as predictive for positive outcomes.

This study confirms earlier research into social workers’ views of the psychiatric needsof children in foster care, where social workers considered 80% required treatment from child mental health practitioners but only 27% were referred [31].

The reasons given for non-referral included placementinstability, belief that the mental health facilities available would fail to meet the child's needs and lack of local authority resources.

Other studies have found a lack of structured assessments of the child in Children's Social Services Departments

The use of standardised instruments such as the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) could inform assessment throughaidingsocial workers in the detection of mental health problems and providing evidence for referring on

McAuley and Davis [28] review the well-being and mental health of looked after children in Great Britain and concur with the Tarren-Sweeney's findings in relation to the level of mental health problemsin this population and with the spread amongst the types of out-ofhomecare. It is very hard to discern whether the pathway through care influences outcomes for these children as the comparators are the general population. Thus, for example, educational attainment of CIC is reported to be poor (13% of looked after children attaining 5 or more General Certificate of Education grades A-C as compared to 62% ofall children in England), but this gives no indication of whetherthe experience of being looked after has improved or worsened the educational achievementtrajectory that these children were on prior to their reception into care.

Key predictors of poor mentalhealth in risk studies include older age at entry into care, intellectual disability, placement instability and adverse life events

It has also been argued that cumulative adversity is more important in predicting mental health in CIC than specific types of harm or single harmful events

Dixon [33] and Dixon, Wade, Byford, Weatherley and Lee [34] report on a study of 106 young people leaving care. Good preparation for leaving care, with older teenagers, was associated with moresuccessful transitions. Leaving care early (16 to 17 years of age) was associated with poorer outcomes and these young people tended to display more challenging behaviour (including offending and substance misuse).

Guglani, Rushton and Ford [29] have reported high levels of psychopathology and educationaldifficulties in children whoare notin out-of-homecare but just have contact with social services,

chiatric disorderat eachlife stage varieslittle and thus the present design of services for children and adolescents whoarelegally and socially dependent on their parents with a transition to adult services at the age of legal responsibility is appropriate. He argues for integrating and strengthening current systems.

The TRACK Study tried to identify factors that may facilitate or impede transitions from CAMHS to AMHS in Greater London [[38]; U.K.]. Forty two of the 65 teams contacted responded to the survey showing that 13 transition protocols were in operation and although the protocols identified the centrality of the service users’ involvementin the transition process, none of the protocols specified how service users should be prepared for transition with a major gap being the omission from protocols of how to ensure continuity of care for those young people not accepted by AMHS.Theresearchers consider that the health and social care needs for this group, who slip through the care net, must become a matterof urgent policy.

Dixon [33] interviewed youngcare leavers and their leaving care workers and found 12% reported mental health problemsat the outset with 24% reporting mental health problems on follow-up 12-15 monthslater

the author suggests that these figures are probably an underestimate as 42% reported emotional and behaviouraldifficulties at the outset and there is evidence that significant mental health problems may coexist)

The TRACKstudy foundthat less than 5 per cent of adolescents who madethetransition received optimal care at the time [38]. Ringeisen, Casanueva, Urato, and Stambaugh[[39]; USA, n = 616; aged 12-15 at baseline and followed up 5-6 years later] report on a study of young adults who had beeninvestigated for child maltreatment in their adolescence by the child welfare systems. Theyalso found a significant decrease in the use of specialist mental health services in the transition from adolescent to young adulthood, declining from 47.6% at baseline to 14.3% on follow-up.

McGorry[[36]; Australia] believes that since mental illness often develops in adolescence or young adulthood that the best way to ensure early treatment is to have a service dedicated to the 15-25 age range.

Birleson [37] agrees that more investment is needed in the prevention and intervention for mental health problemsearly in life, but argues that if we set aside substanceusedisorder, that the total rate of psy

monthsand that children reported restrictive and intrusive services more reliably than services that were provided in their natural environment

Another similarly named instrument, the Services Assessmentfor Children and Adolescents also measures mental health services use and treatments and showshigh reliability between parent and child reports

Looking at outcomes from care is complicated by a range offactors, including age at entry to care, reason for entering care, duration in care and that CIC include a group whocan be described as reunification failures where a return to their parents care has failed. While most children enter care to protect them from harm, a review of recent studies in the USAreveals that a sizeable group (18%) enter care because of behavioural problems andthat for children aged 11 and overentering care this proportion rises to 50%, with many of these remaining in group rather than family based out-of-homecare

The Casey Field Office Mental Health study compared rates of lifetime and past year mental health disorder of youth, aged 14 17 in foster care (n = 188) with a group matched byage, race/ethnicity and gender from the general population (n = 7753).

in both groups, most youth (64%) had no mental health diagnosis in the past year, but the youth in the foster care were morelikely to have at least one lifetime diagnosis (63%) as compared to the general population (46%).

The foster care group hadsignificantly higherlifetime and past year rates of conduct disorder (21% compared to 7%), ADHD (15% compared to 4.5%), major depressive disorder (19% compared to 12%) and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (13% compared to 5%). The population sample had higherrates of lifetime and past year hypomania (4% comparedto 0%), lifetime panicdisorder (2.5% compared to 0%) and past year social phobia (13% compared to 7%)

The Child and Adolescent Services Assessment (CASA)is a self-report instrument that was developed to establish whetherselfreport in child populationsis as reliable as in adult populations where they can provide a reasonably valid indicator of service use. The CASA, while developed with mental health service use as the main focus, aims to identify the whole range of service use accessed within the public sector, including: health, mental health, substance abuse, social service, education and youthjustice. It also examines attitudes towards treatment, out-of-pocket costs for treatmentand perceived barriers to service use. Results showedthat reports of lifetime service use were as reliable as were reports of service use in the last three

urgent need for a wider range of alternative care options for the adolescent population. Barber and Delfabbro [47] report that foster care is a failure for children with conduct disorder.

Vinnerljung and Sallnas [[48]; Sweden] report on a study of 718 young people (age 25 years) who wereplaced in out-of-homecarein their teens (aged 13 16 years). As with Barber and Delfabbro [47] they found a difference between young people placed in care for behavioural problems (such as delinquency or seriously disruptive behaviour at school) and those placed for other reasons (such as a history of abuse, neglect or mentally unstable parents). Those placed in care for behavioural reasons, as compared to their age group peers who were not placed into care, had very high rates of premature death (5.4% compared to 0.6%), involvementin crime (75% compared to 16%), hospitalization for mental health problems (30% compared to 1%), teenage parenthood and low educational attainment (67% compared to 10%),.

Young people placed for other reasons had better outcomes, for example only 48% had low educational outcomes,butstill considerably worse than their age group peers. In Sweden 65% ofall children entering care were adolescents with the main reason for admission being behaviour problems (it should be noted that Sweden has very few young offenders in the prison system andthey are mainly dealt with through the child welfare system so these data are not directly comparable to most other European countries)

Young People not in Employment, Education,Training (NEET)

a recent report [49] highlighted that approximately 18% of 16-24 year-olds in England are classified as NEET.

The Longitudinal Study of Young People in England found that NEET status was associated with poor educational outcomes and that risk behaviours at 13/14 years old were associated with becoming NEETthree yearslater.

These included smoking, trying cannabis, engaging in graffiti and vandalism.

Alcohol was the exception which did not discriminate between those who did and did not become NEET[
