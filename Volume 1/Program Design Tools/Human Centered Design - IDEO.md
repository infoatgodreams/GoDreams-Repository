# Workbook
## Inspiration
Frame your design challenge : 
			- Drive towards impact
			- Short and easy to remember
			- Allow for a variety of solutions
			- Consider constraints and context
			- Not too narrow(limited) not too broad (not knowing where to start)
				- Fill Up: 
					- What is the problem you are trying to solve? 
					- Frame this as a design question
					- State the ultimate impact we are trying to have
					- What are some possible solutions to the problem
					- Write down context and constraints
					- Iterate
