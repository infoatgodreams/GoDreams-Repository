## Problem
Quality of care delivered at Child Care Institutions is on average inadequate and widely disparate. 

## Constraints
- CCIs are under-resourced and short staffed
- There is a skill gap and talent shortage in CCI management
- There is limited funding available in the sector
- State cannot be relied upon as the sole arbiter of quality of institutional care. CCIs operate in silos. 

## Program Goals
- Increase funding available to CCIs to sufficient levels based on target care quality.
    
- Increase KSM (Knowledge, Skills, Mindsets) of CCI staff and management to sufficient levels based on target care quality. 
    
- Enable, Ensure and Incentivize the continuous maintenance of care quality at sufficient levels across CCIs
    
## Design Challenge

1.  What is the most efficient path to providing quality care for a Child Care Institution? 
    
2.  What is the fastest path to increasing the total pool of funding available in the sector?
    
3.  How can A) and B) be delivered to ensure sustainable upkeep of quality of care?

## Secondary Research

**Goal** -To put together information in core areas of program development and draw insights that will allow us to : 

1.  Identify questions for primary research : What don't we know about how CCIs in India operate?
2. Avoid reinventing the wheel during program design : What have others done already?
3. Identify key levers and critical factors that influence the care quality at CCIs  based on existing studies/practices in the sector under the following categories: 
	- Gold Standard Practices and outcomes under all domains :
		-  Best Practices and Inputs
		-  M&E and Outcome Measurements
		-  Successful Interventions
	- Baseline/Current Reality for childcare under all domains:
		- Gaps observed specifically in institutional care
		- Outcome Measurements
4.	 Identify innovations in associated sectors and document potential practices that can be implemented in CCIs.

### **Research Sources:**
- #### 1. Gold Standards and Innovations in Institutional Child Care 
	- *We will be looking at :*
		- Domestic and International CCIs
		- Domestic and Intl Service Providers to CCIs
		- Domestic and Intl Services available for vulnerable children outside of institutions
		- Domestic and Foreign Govt Regulations and UN/International Body Regulations
	-  *What we are looking for:*
		- Successful interventions in institutional care settings
		-  Inputs and best practices that have led to excellent outcomes
		- Outcome measurement tools used
		- Indicators of excellent outcomes
- #### 2. Baselines for Institutional Care
	-  *We will be looking at:*
		-  Domestic and International CCIs
	- *What we are looking for:* 
		- Practices that result in better outcomes in comparison 
		- Outcome measurement tools
		- Data suggesting gaps in outcomes specifically in institutional care settings
- ### 3. Associated Sectors and Innovations
	- *We will be looking at:* 
		- Diverse sectors and domain specific sectors such as 
			- Traditional education sector
			- Ed tech
			- Hostel care
			- Pediatric hospital wards
			- Sporting academies
			- School kitchens/cafeterias
	- *What we are looking for:*
		- Best Practices and Manuals
		- Outcome Measurement Tools

## Primary Research

### Focus Groups
**Goal** -Work closely with 10 CCIs  to decode : 
1. What are the current practices and outcomes of the CCIs in the domains, sub-domains and key areas identified in the secondary research
2. Map and evaluate the support ecosystem available to CCIs
3. Identify the challenges preventing CCIs from adopting best practices and create case studies for the same
4. Convert case studies into design problems for the design sprint

### CCI Landscape Survey
1. Build a basic profile of CCIs across the country through quantitative data towards future use in city expansion and demographic context
2. What does the current ecosystem around CCIs across the country look like in terms of stakeholders and services available to them? 
3. Identify challenges preventing CCIs across the country from adopting best practices and create 1 case profile per city 
4. Convert case profiles into design problems for the design sprint
