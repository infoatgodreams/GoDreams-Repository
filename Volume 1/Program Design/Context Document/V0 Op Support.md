# Need
[[Need For CAP]]

- APPI Applications
	- Care Services increase in intensity from:
		- Low Intensity, High Coverage:  Specialized services for families with additional needs
		- Medium Intensity and Coverage: Targeted support for families and children at risk

	- Majority of CCIs currently not operating at a level where they can access/qualify for funding from grant making organizations
		- They have a capacity and capability deficit caused due to lack of resources
	- **Lack of Resources/Money**:
		- CCI behaviors attributable to whether they are in survival mode or not
		- CCIs getting funded by grant organizations make them less dependent on walk in donors
	- **Lack of talent/people**: 
		- Homes staffed with people who find it hard to be employed elsewhere
			- Destitute women, alumni of homes, clergy, MSW etc 
		- People come from a resource constraint background
	- **Lack of Operating Systems**
		- Sector unprofessional, unorganized 
		- Not enough transparency in operations
		- Suspicion based approach
