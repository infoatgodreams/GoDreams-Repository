# CSF
[[CSF]]

- APPI Applications
	- Comprehensive CCI Standardization Framework(CSF) (Care standards checkboxes, processes and routines for inputs & outputs(M&E, Outcome measurement & Benchmark Assessments)  - > backend can contain first princples and front ended by a clear task list for CCI stakeholders)  that acts as a blueprint/wireframe for running a CCI.
	-  CSF Design Stages
		1. Landscape study of the existing care standards followed and current budget
		2. Create benchmarks for care standards (based on the JJ Act and SME recommendations) and estimate budgets for the same: 
		3. Define eligibility criteria based on care standards, legal, organisational, financial standards expected of CCIs
		4. Prepare a standard budget range for grant submission (based on JJ Act rules): 
	-  CSF Components
		1. Training/ Workshops
		2. Operating Systems (software, equipment,facilities)



# Need
[[Need For CAP]]

- APPI Applications
	- Care Services increase in intensity from:
		- Low Intensity, High Coverage:  Specialized services for families with additional needs
		- Medium Intensity and Coverage: Targeted support for families and children at risk
		- High Intensity and Coverage: Universal support for caregivers and children
	- Majority of CCIs currently not operating at a level where they can access/qualify for funding from grant making organizations
		- They have a capacity and capability deficit caused due to lack of resources
	- **Lack of Resources/Money**:
		- CCI behaviors attributable to whether they are in survival mode or not
		- CCIs getting funded by grant organizations make them less dependent on walk in donors
	- **Lack of talent/people**: 
		- Homes staffed with people who find it hard to be employed elsewhere
			- Destitute women, alumni of homes, clergy, MSW etc 
		- People come from a resource constraint background
	- **Lack of Operating Systems**
		- Sector unprofessional, unorganized 
		- Not enough transparency in operations
		- Suspicion based approach
	- **Lack of Exposure**
	- **Care Practices**
