# Problem 

- **Lack of financial capital and attention in the space:** 
	- State funding into child care institutions is minimal, and continues to decrease year on year. This also results in a lack of attention to the space, a hostile or inefectual policy environment for practitioners and lack of accurate on ground data for policy creation.
	- Private sector is not incentivized to fund CCIs outside of CSR
		- CCIs are often unable to qualify for funding due to capacity and capability deficits
	- Donations by individuals are often ad-hoc, irregular and highly dependent on visitation and interactions with children that are often detrimental to children's developmental outcomes. 
- Lack of Scalability due to 
	- Difficulty scaling high quality care practices: 
		- Tradition and trial and error based care practices are prevalent in most CCIs
		- No reference knowledge base or access to expertise via trainings or upskilling exists.
		- CCIs operate in siloes and are unable to disseminate knowledge, best practices or learn from each-other
	- Talent
		-  No feeder institutions 
		-  No opportunities to upskill or specialize in caregiving post hiring
		-  Low pay grade leading to ad-hoc hiring and under-qualified, dissatisfied staff
- Lack of Attention to the space from: 
	- State : State funding for children in institutions continues to decrease year on year, and results in a lack of attention to issues facing the space. This often results in a hostile policy environment to on-ground operators and lack of accurate data for policy design
	- Society: Public interactions with Child Care Institutions are dominated by ad-hoc inputs and short term interactions that result in neglect and apathy.
