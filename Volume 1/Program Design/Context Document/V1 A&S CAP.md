#  Stakeholder Map
-  **Stakeholders:**
	- **Children**
		- Don’t have access to care
		- Poor quality of care
		- Ineffective inputs
		- Policies are disconnected from their reality (eg. blanket repatriation for runaway children to facilitate family preservation)
		- Short-term runway / abrupt exit
	-  **Children’s Homes**
		-  Lack of intellectual capital (1st principles of child care)\
		- Lack of money (financial capital)
		- Funding based on no. of children vs quality of care - which keeps discussions at basic inputs level vs growth or quality level. 
		- Lack of talent (people) -> not a professional discipline and hence no hiring pipeline.  
		- Hostile, disconnected, regulatory policy environment
		- Apathy & neglect from society & media 
		- Isolated / operate in silos
		- Personal, value based approach of leadership
		- Operates in a high risk environment with regular scrutiny / suspicion from others
		- Government 
		- Funders (i.e Corporates, Foundations, Philanthropists, Retail Donors)
		- Community / the Public / larger Society  
	- **Government:**
		- Lack of execution capacity 
		- Lack of data lending to prescriptive policy
		- Electorally insignificant constituency (no political advantage)
		- Long term nature of outcomes not aligned with election cycles
	- **Funders:**
		- Lack of impact measurement tools as outcomes are too long term and complex to track
		- Lack of credible at-scale operators
		- Comparatively high risk to goodwill and reputation in case of mishaps
		- A nascent uncrowded sector with high potential to establish legacy and thought leadership.
		- Community / the Public / larger Society
		- Misconceptions / flawed understanding of the sector
		- Generally suspicious of children’s homes due to sensationalised stories in the media
		- Understanding is limited to what is shown in movies and the media (sensationalised depiction of ground reality).
		- Wish to contribute but do not know how to be effective.
		- Brings input focused, charity mindset to the sector through ad hoc interactions, inadequate focus / recognition.
		- Does not think about the problem much -- general neglect and apathy
