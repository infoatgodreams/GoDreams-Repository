Scope: A study of change of intellectual level in 132 "dependent and neglected" children aged two through seven - at Irvington House over a period of 4.5 years. The study tests for IQ changes (Stanford Binet Test) over the period.

- Irvington House has kept to the original intention of having no more than 50 children in the 4 dormitories regardless of outside pressures
- In initial planning, they considered trying to imitate some sort of family life, but quickly came to realize that this was not only impractical but probably undesirable and dishonest as well. 
- We have therefore been quite clear with ourselves and we hope with the children, that Irvington house is a house and not a home. That counselors are counselors and not parents, and that the other children in the dormitory are members of a group, not of a family. 

- Children are not confined to dormitories, but dormitories are relatively self-contained units with separate sleeping and playing quarters
- For the youngest groups, 2-3 year olds, we regularly scheduled 30 shifts a week of six staff members. The children in this group eat in a space adjacent to the dormitory.
- The older groups eat in our main dining room. For the three older units, we regularly scheduled 20 shifts a week of four staff members. 

# Caregiving
[Caregiving](Volume%201/Roll%20Ups/Caregiving.md), [ Child Profile](Volume%201/Roll%20Ups/Child%20Profile.md)

- For young children a paramount need is to feel that there is someone who really cares for him or her as an individual human being, someone with whom and for whom he is special. In addition to this special one to one relationship, the child must also feel that all, or most, of the people around him like and respect him for what he is. We have called this basic concept, along with teh child-care practices that have grown out of it, "individualization. 
- We assumed that small children need relatively small, self-contained settings for their basic physical care. They need the opportunity for privacy, some belongings which are their very own, some which are to be shared and the freedom to explore within boundaries that set unobtrusive but firm limits on impulse. 
- A final assumption in relation to the program offered is that any positive life experience, no matter what its duration, strengthens the child in terms of meeting subsequent life experiences. 
- There is no concept of "spoiling the children" as while it is morally and professionally impossibly to not provide the maximum of what we have, our assumption is that if we offer this, a child is better equipped to meet the vicissitudes of whatever his life may be when he leaves us. 

- The one-to-one relationship thus developed between counselor and child is to give the child a feeling that, despite some of the necessary impersonality and antiseptic quality of an institutional environment, someone on the staff cares for him or her as an individual human being above and beyond the requirements of the job. 

## Staff Selection, Supervision and Allocation
- The child-care staff is for the most part college-trained. The average age is 24.
	- We are particularly concerned to find people interested in and responsive to professional supervision
	- The child-care workers are directly supervised by trained group workers, with individual conferences as the main supervisory tool 
	- We look for people interested in eventually undertaking graduate training in social work or a related field and who will be, consequently, professionally as well as personally motivated. 
	- As a matter of policy, we always have had at least one male worker assigned to the three older groups
	- We have tried consciously to keep the numebr of different adults with whom a child must have a meaningful relationship to a minimum
	- A child-care worker once assigned to a given dormitory, has remained there throughout his employment at the house. 
	- Each worker has a case load of approximately 20 children. 
# Results of the study
[[Education]]
- Mean initial IQ level of 89 and terminal level of 97.58 with roughly 8.72 months of gap between tests. 
- Smallest increments are found among chidlren functioning within the average range at the time of their admission. 
	- This data suggests that many of the children who fall initially into the below-average groups are children of normal intelligence who are suffering impairments based on lack of environmental opportunity, or emotional difficulties, or both, and that these cases respond favorably to the institutional environment provided. 
- Those children who perform at an average level initially may, in the majority, be those of this same normal IQ group, whose functioning is less impaired as a result of environmental inadequacy. 
- The relatively small group of children initially performing at above average levels tend to improve significantly. 
	- It is suggested that this group is composed of the brighter children whose previous environments provided markedly inadequate intellectual stimulation or markedly severe emotional deprivation. 
- The magnitude of increment seems directly related to the duration of stay in the institution but the optimal interval appears to be approximately one year, as children remaining much longer do not show significantly greater improvement that children remaining upto a year. 
- The children who appear ot gain most from the institution setting are those whose functioning is far below their ability because of environmental or emotional deprivation 
	- [Restoration](Restoration)Where foster home placement subsequent to the institutional placement is indicated, however, perhaps we should plan in terms of allowing the child to achieve the maximum benefits of the institution before transferring him, instead of following the policy which is now general, namely, transferring the child as soon as a home is available.
- With respect to age, there is no doubt that separation from the natural parents for practically all children under three, for most children between three and five, and for very many children between give and eight, creates anxiety, a sense of loss, a sense of guilt and unworthiness and extreme emotional privation, which thereafter handicap the child's future intellectual, school and social adjustment.
