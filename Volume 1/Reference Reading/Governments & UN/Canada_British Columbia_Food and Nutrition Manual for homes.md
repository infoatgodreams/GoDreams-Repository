# SECTION 1: Monitoring Your Food And Nutrition Program
- A monitoring program helps a facility to maintain health and safety standards.
- Keep copies of the results of your checklists for at least one year. You may want to havea specific binder just for keeping the completed checklists. Remember to sign and date them.
- Checklists, Forms and their purpose: 
	- [Menu Checklist](Volume%201/Reference%20Reading/Governments%20&%20UN/Canada_British%20Columbia_Food%20and%20Nutrition%20Manual%20for%20homes.md#Menu%20Checklist) : To determine that the cycle menu meets the minimum recommendations contained in Eating Well with Canada’s Food Guide.
	- [Satisfaction with Nutrition and Food Services Survey](Volume%201/Reference%20Reading/Governments%20&%20UN/Canada_British%20Columbia_Food%20and%20Nutrition%20Manual%20for%20homes.md#Satisfaction%20with%20Nutrition%20and%20Food%20Services%20Survey) : To determine the satisfaction of persons in care with the nutrition and food service.
	- [Nutrition Care Plan Checklist](Volume%201/Reference%20Reading/Governments%20&%20UN/Canada_British%20Columbia_Food%20and%20Nutrition%20Manual%20for%20homes.md#Nutrition%20Care%20Plan%20Checklist) : To determine that the facility is meeting the requirements of the regulations for residential care under the Community
		- [SCREENING FORM - When to Refer to a Registered Dietitian](Volume%201/Reference%20Reading/Governments%20&%20UN/Canada_British%20Columbia_Food%20and%20Nutrition%20Manual%20for%20homes.md#SCREENING%20FORM%20-%20When%20to%20Refer%20to%20a%20Registered%20Dietitian)
	- Care and Assisted Living Form in terms of nutrition care planning.
	- Mealtime Checklist: To review the mealtime environment in the facility.
	- Meals and More Checklist: To determine whether key information contained in theMeals and More manual has been implemented in the facility
	- 

## [[Menu Checklist]] 
- The purpose of this checklist is to review the facility’s menu to see if it meets the minimum recommendations of the Eating Well with Canada’s Food Guide.
- This means it will also meet the regulations for residential care under the Community Care and Assisted Living Act.
- The Menu Checklist should be completed whenever you make changes to your menu.
- You should also complete the checklist for all menu types provided. For example, you may have a general menu, a texture-modified menu (for example, for puréed food) and/or menus for special diets (for example, for people with diabetes). Ideally, you should complete the form for one week of each of these menu types.
- More detailed information about the foods and how to determine their serving sizes can be found for each of the four food groups as follows:
- Fruit and Vegetables: www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/food-guide-aliment/choose-choix/fruit/index-eng.php
	- Grains: www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/food-guide-aliment/choose-choix/grain-cereal/index-eng.php
	- Milk/Milk Alternatives: www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/food-guide-aliment/choose-choix/milk-lait/index-eng.php
	- Meat/Alternatives: www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/food-guide-aliment/choose-choix/meat-viande/index-eng.php
	- To help determine the number of Food Guide servings in mixed dishes, see: www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/food-guide-aliment/using-utiliser/count-calcul-eng.php

## [[Satisfaction with Nutrition and Food Services Survey]]
- The Satisfaction with Nutrition and Food Services Survey is used to ensure that those incare have input into the food provided at your facility. You may need to revise this form to meet your facility needs.
- Satisfaction with nutrition and food services should be checked at least once a year and/or whenever there are changes to the menu (for example, the fall/winter season and the spring/summer season). 
- Complete one survey for each person. If you have more than 10 people, use the summary form to gather and review your results.
- The facility staff should provide a way for those in care, family members and substitute decision-makers to discuss food issues (for example, a meeting). These should be recorded and kept on file. 
- Some people may have difficulty completing a survey. It may be better to do an informal survey with those in care and/or their representatives. (*At mealtimes, talk to persons in care and carefully listen to their responses. Often the most input will be provided from asking questions such as “How was your meal?” As part of your meal observations, follow-up with personsin care who eat out for meals frequently. This may be a sign that they are not satisfied with meals provided. Checking food waste (that is, the types and amount of foods discarded) can also help to measure satisfaction*)
- The most common reasons for waste include:
	-  Unsuitable timing and presentation of meals.
	-  Interruptions by or lack of assistance from staff at meals.
	-  Feeling bored or not familiar with the menu.
	-  Being left to wait for food while others eat.
	-  Unsuitable environment (for example, uncomfortable seating).
	-  Being provided with the wrong diet.
	-  Side effects of diseases and treatments (for example, medications).
	- Not being able to swallow.


## Nutrition Care Plan Checklist
- Complete the Nutrition Care Plan Checklist at least every six months for a minimum of four people in care.
- When a person is first admitted to the facility, a nutrition care plan should be completed within two weeks. Within 14 weeks of admission, the nutrition care plan should be reviewed. 
	- After this, the nutrition care plan should be reviewed and updated at least once a year for adults. For children, it should be reviewed and updated at least every six months.




# SECTION 2 : Individual Nutrition Care Planning
[[Individual Nutrition Care Plan]]

- A nutrition care plan is a tool for staff that ensures that the person in care receives consistent and quality nutrition care.
	- It considers the abilities, the physical, social and emotional needs and the cultural and spiritual preferences of the person in care. 
	- The initial nutrition care plan is completed at admission and ideally is reviewed within 14 weeks of admission. Thereafter, the plan must be reviewed at least once a year for adults. 
	- For children, the plan should be reviewed at least every six months. The plan should also be reviewed in response to any changes for adults or children.
	- Staff develop the nutrition care plan. They also ensure that the services of a Registered Dietitian are obtained in response to a person’s needs. These needs are determined by completing the Food and Nutrition Information Form and the screening form When to Refer to a Dietitian.



- Nutrition Planning and Feedback Cycle
	- Step 1: Assess and Complete Food and Nutrition Information Form
		- Identify Strengths and Concerns.
		- Complete the Nutrition Screening Form When to Refer to a Dietitian
	- Step 2: Develop the Nutrition Care Plan
		- Use the Nutrition Care Plan
	- Step 3: Evaluate and Review the Nutrition Care Plan
	- Step 4: Revise the Nutrition Care Plan


- **Steps to Complete an Individual Nutrition Care Plan**
	- **Step 1: Assessment of Nutrition Concerns** 
		- Gather information about the person in care’s eating habits, health, blood values from the lab, height and weight, functioning, behaviour, and lifestyle. 
			- Obtain information from:
				- the chart or health record.
				- the person, their family members, staff members and care providers (for example day-program staff) as well as the person in care’s doctor.
				- observe the person in care at meal and snack times.
				- Complete the Food and Nutrition Information form. 
				- Record strengths and concerns on the Nutrition Care Plan Summary form under “Assessment of Nutrition Health.”
				- Next, complete the screening form When to Refer to a Registered Dietitian. Write the score on the Food and Nutrition Information form. If the score is 10 or more, this indicates that the person may require a referral to a Registered Dietitian. Develop a nutrition care plan that can be used until the Registered Dietitian comes to the home.
				- If the score is between 0 and 9, the services of a Registered Dietitian may not be required at this time. 
				- Review the nutrition concerns identified with the person in care’s physician.
				-  Develop a nutrition care plan.
	- **Step 2: Developing and Using an Action Plan**
		- Work with the person in care to develop an action plan for each goal. Document it on theNutrition Care Plan Summary form
			- For each action, state what is to be done as well as by whom and by what date. Provide simple and clear directions for caregivers to follow.
	- **Step 3: Evaluation and Review**
		- The nutrition care plan should be reviewed as set out in the person in care’s overall care plan. It is revised in response to needs such as:
			- loss of ability to move around freely or use the hands to grasp small objects
			- problems with behaviour, mood, relationships or physical health (for example, weight loss, abnormal lab values, swallowing problems, new diagnosis)
			- marked or sudden improvement in health status
			- change in medication and/or dosage.
		- Systems for ensuring that caregivers actually follow the plans (for example, in the facility and other contexts such as eating out) should be in place. 
			- For example, if the action plan is to weigh the person every two weeks, a staff member should be assigned this responsibility. 
			- If the goals have not been met, the following questions should be asked:
				- Was this really a concern for the person?
				- Were the stated goals, time frames and approaches realistic and measurable?
				- Were the actions carried out and did they help the person to achieve the goals?
	- **Step 4: Revise the Nutrition Care Plan**



### Food and Nutrition Information



### SCREENING FORM - [[When to Refer to a Registered Dietitian]]


- [[Individual Nutrition Care Plan]] Considerations
	- **Special Diet**
		- This includes any changes (amount, types or texture) that are needed in food or fluid intake, including diets for weight loss.
		 - Medical Conditions that require dietary changes 
	-  **Swallowing and Chewing Problems**
		- This applies if the person has been diagnosed with dysphagia or a swallowing disorder or has any of the following warning signs:
			- Coughing, choking, drooling, pocketing food, gurgly-sounding or slurred speech during/after eating or drinking.
			- Complains food “gets stuck,” or “goes down the wrong way,” or has frequent throat clearing. Refuses or avoids certain food(s).
			-  Lung congestion or chronic respiratory infection.
			- Drowsiness or fatigue at mealtimes or is unable to keep upright for an entire meal.
			- Takes more than 30 minutes to eat a meal.
	-  **Abnormal Lab Results**
		-  if any of these are abnormal: blood sugars (random, fasting), albumin, cholesterol (total, HDL, LDL), hemoglobin, hematrocrit, ferritin, serum creatinine, hemoglobin A1c, prealbumin, total lymphocyte count, liver enzymes, triglycerides, potassium,sodium, folate, vitamin B12, homocysteine or microalbumin.
	- **Medications**
		- Consider all types including PRNs (for example, laxatives, antacids, enemas), vitamin and mineral supplements, herbal remedies, etc. when counting the total number taken. Also consider if any of the following are taken: Isonazid (INH), antipsychotics, antiseizure medications, lithium, statins or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI).
	- **Behavioral Eating Problems**
		- if the person in care has behaviours such as hearing internal voices that affectfood intake, eating non-food or unsafe food items, regurgitating or self-inducing vomiting, taking excess fluids, hoarding food, eating very quickly, eating a limited range of foods (picky eater), hyperactivity, involuntary movements, etc.
	-  **Condition Where Diet Therapy Benefits Treatment** 
		- Breathing problems include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure or lung diseases. Mental illnesses include schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar or major depression, substance abuse disorders, autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The “Other” box is checked if the person has a condition that is not indicated and where diet therapy can help treatment. Check with your licensing officer if you are unsure
	- **Body Measures**
		- If it is difficult to measure weight (for example, the person is in a wheelchair), seek help from a health care professional. Significant weight changes (that is, weight gain or loss) are defined as 5% in 1 month, 7.5% in 2 months or 10% in 6 months (see the table below). 
		- Do not use the Body Mass Index (BMI) for those who are pregnant or breastfeeding, younger than 2 years old or over 64 years old. 
		- If the BMI is between 25 and 29, this is the “Caution Zone” which means there is some health risks associated with this range. Refer to the Weight Control information in this manual for ideas to help reduce weight or pre vent further weight gain.
		-  Documenting Height and Weight
			- Weight gain or loss greater than 5% over one month, 7.5% over three months or 10% over six months requires a referral to a Registered Dietitian.
			- Determining Weight Goals
				- What is the weight history of the person in care?
				- Are they ready to change their weight? Do they have the ability to change their weight?
				- Set small goals that can be met in less than a year’s time. A healthy weight loss is 0.5–1 kg (1–2 lbs) per week. Be specific about what actions will be taken to reach the weight goal. What type of exercise will be done and how often? What food plan will be followed? How will it be tracked?
	- **Developing an Eating and Drinking Plan**
		- An eating and drinking plan is a record of how to assist a person to eat and drink. It is anoptional tool that provides specific directions from the nutrition care plan at mealtimes.

		- Select lower-fat milk alternatives. Compare the Nutrition Facts table on yogurts or cheeses to make wise choices. 
		- Choose cheeses with less than 20% M.F. (milk fat) more often than others. Try partly skim mozzarella and light cheeses. More information on Nutrition Labelling is provided in the Purchasing Food Wisely section of this manual.
		- Offer milk at meals and snacks. Sometimes milk is restricted in the belief that it causes mucus. This has not been proven. Excess mucus can occur for many reasons (for example, not drinking enough fluids). Consult the person in care’s physician.
		-  Coffee whiteners, whipped toppings, butter, margarine, sour cream, powderedcheeses in macaroni and cheese dinners, cream cheese and rice or nut milks are not counted as part of this food group. They do not provide the same nutrients

	- One serving equals:
		- 50–100 g (2–4 oz.) cooked lean meat, fish, shellfish or poultry
		-  30 ml (2 Tbsp.) nut butters (for example, peanut, cashew, almonds, hazelnut) or seed butters (forexample, sunflower, sesame)
		- 125–250 ml (½–1 cup) cooked dried peas, beans or lentils
		- 2 eggs
		- 175 ml (¾ cup or 150 g) tofu
		- 60 ml (¼ cup) shelled nuts and seeds
	- Guidelines and Tips for Meat and Alternatives
		- Have meat alternatives such as beans, lentils and tofu often
		- Eat at least two Food Guide servings of fish each week
		- Choose fish such as char, herring, mackerel, salmon, sardines and trout that are high in omega-3 fatty acids which have been found to have heart health benefits. 
		- Add canned salmon or tuna to pasta dishes or salads.
		- Select lean meat and alternatives prepared with little or no added fat or salt
		- Trim the visible fat from meats. Remove the skin from poultry
		- Use cooking methods such as stewing, roasting, baking, broiling, microwav ing or poaching that require little or no added fat. Use herbs and fresh salsas to season and flavour fish, meats and poultry
		- If you eat luncheon meats, sausages, wieners or packaged meats, choose those lower in salt (sodium) and fat. Buy fresh or frozen meat, fish and poultry without breading or rich sauces. Use dry-roasted nuts and seeds without added oils or salt
		- Look for lean or extra-lean cuts of meat (for example, inside round roast, outside round roast, eye of round steak or roast, strip loin steak, sirloin steak, rump roast). Choose “lean ground” or “extra-lean ground” beef, poul try, lamb and pork. 
		-  Provide at least two servings from this group each day. Note that side bacon is not counted as part of the meat and alternatives group
		- Use dried peas, beans (navy, black), chickpeas (also known as garbanzo beans and lentils (red, green or brown), nuts, seeds and boiled eggs in soups, casseroles, stir-fries, salads and burritos, or mash them into dips.
		- Try different soybean-based foods like tempeh. Substitute tofu for half the ground. Select tofu made with calcium
		- Use small strips or pieces of meat, poultry or fish to add to stir-fries, stews, soupsor salads
		- For a low-fat option, wrap a chicken breast or fish fillet with vegetables and herbsin aluminum foil and bake in the oven or on the barbecue.

- [[Oils and Fats]]
	- Include between 30–45 ml (2–3 Tbsp.) of unsaturated fat each day.
	- Guidelines and Tips for Fats and Oils
		- Unsaturated fats include oils (for example, canola, corn, flaxseed, olive, peanut,soybean and sunflower) used for cooking, salad dressings, soft tub margarine and mayonnaise. This is how 30 ml (2 Tbsp.) of unsaturated fat may look in a day of eating
		- Breakfast 5 ml (1 tsp.) of soft non-hydrogenated margarine on toast. 
		- 5 ml (1 tsp.) of canola oil in a pan to make scrambled eggs
		- Lunch 15 ml (1 Tbsp.) of oil-type salad dressing (for example, balsamic, Italian, vinaigrettes) on a salad
		- Dinner 5 ml (1 tsp.) of canola or olive oil used to stir-fry.
		- Choose soft margarines that are low in saturated and trans fats. Limit butter, hard margarine, lard and shortening.
		-  Limit foods that may be high in fat, such as gravy, cream-based soups and salad dressing. Use low fat milk instead of cream in soups.
		-  Limit foods with hidden fats, such as baked goods, sauces and desserts.
		-  Choose preparation methods that require little or no fat: steam, stew, roast,broil, microwave or bake. Only occasionally fry or deep-fry. Use small amounts of vegetable oils for stir-frying or sautéing (for example, 5 ml/1 tsp.) Heat the oil before frying to prevent the food from soaking it up.
		- Fill a spray bottle with vegetable oil to spray your pans instead of greasing them.
		-  Make your own salad dressing with canola or olive oil. Add balsamic, rice wine or other vinegars. Flavour the dressing with lemon juice, dry or Dijon mustard, garlic and herbs. Be sure to refrigerate the salad dressings.
		-  Keep oils in a cool dark cupboard or in the refrigerator to prevent them fromspoiling.

- [[Fluids]]
	- Provide 1.5–2 L (6–8 cups) of fluid daily.
		-  Encourage persons in care to drink water, juice,soup, milk, decaffeinated coffee and decaffeinated tea.
		-  Try to limit coffee, regular tea and cola-based drinks that contain caffeine to 3 cups or fewer per day. 
		- Also avoid energy drinks. Caffeine may interfere with sleep and medications and may increase agitation.These beverages are not recommended for children.
	- Guidelines and Tips for Fluids
		- Milk and water are the preferred drinks for both children and adults.
		- Encourage water in addition to other beverages at all meals and snacks.
		- Provide water when giving medications.
		- Assist those who require help with drinking. Provide thickened fluids of the right consistency where appropriate.
		-  Define standard serving sizes of fluids offered at meals to make recording of the amount consumed and eliminated easier (for example, In/Out Records). 
			- Examples include coffee cup = 250ml (1 cup), juice, water, milk glass = 250ml (1 cup),soup bowl = 125 ml (1/2 cup).
		- Provide water jugs and glasses for everyone. Use water bottles and wheelchaircup holders where applicable.
		-  Try different fluids (for example, hot beverages, cold water, juices, frozen juice, popsicles, lemon or other citrus flavoured waters)
		-  Offer fluids before meals.
		- Try to avoid fluid products with the words “fruit drinks”, “punch”, “cocktail”, “beverage” or that end in “ade”. These products are high in sugar and contain little fruit.
		- Children can get dehydrated quickly. To keep them hydrated encourage them totake water breaks during the day, take a sip from the water fountain often, drink water before, during and after active play and carry a water bottle.
		- Fortified waters contain additional vitamins and nutrients. They're generally not needed if a person is eating a healthy diet.

- [[Fibre]]
	- Fibre is naturally found in plant-based foods (for example, whole grain breads and cereals, beans, lentils, fruits and vegetables). Fibres may also be made from plant and animal materials (for example, oat B-glucan, psyllium and inulin). They all have benefits such as keeping bowels regular and controlling blood fats and sugar levels.
	- Try to get at least 25 grams (1 ounce) of fibre in the diet each day. 
	- The following offers some tips on how to include fibre in a diet.
		- Add cereals high in fibre (for example, All-Bran®, Fiber One®, and 100% Bran) to other cereals. Try a cereal that contains at least 2 grams of fibre per serving. This means it is a source of fibre.
		- Add fresh fruit, dried fruits, nuts and/or seeds (for example, sunflower or pumpkin) to cereals, baked goods and salads.
		-  Substitute bran for bread crumbs in recipes (for example, meatloaf, topping on casseroles, hamburgers, or coating fish, chicken or chops). Add bran to items such as chili, thick soups, sloppy joes or sandwich spreads.
		- Stir bran cereal, flaxseeds, rolled oats, wheat germ, chopped nuts, dried fruit or frozen blueberries into batters for pancakes, waffles, muffins, cookies and quick breads.
		- Try legumes in salads (for example, bean salad) or as a main dish (for example, baked beans).
		-  Vegetables such as lettuce, radishes, celery and onion that contain important nutrients do not contain a lot of dietary fibre. Try salad variations such as carrot salad, fruit salad, bean salad and spinach salad. 
		- Dietary fibre is just as high in cooked vegetables as it is in raw. When you eat potatoes and fresh fruits, wash them thoroughly and eat the skins, too.
		- Substitute whole wheat flour or oat bran for up to half the amount of white flour in recipes. Note that enriched wheat flour and unbleached flour are both refined white flour and are not good sources of fibre.
		-  Try whole wheat pitas, tortillas and English muffins.

- [[Salt]]
	- Most people tend to eat much more salt (sodium) than they require. Minimize salt intake by:
		-  focusing on using fresh, whole foods.
		- using less salt at the table and in cooking.
		- tasting foods before adding salt and using less salt at the table.
		-  using lower-sodium broths and bouillon cubes.
		-  adding less salt when cooking and flavouring foods with lemon, herbs or spices instead of salt.

# SECTION 6: [[MENU PLANNING]]
- A cycle menu is planned for many days and repeated at the end of a given time period. For example, a four-week menu contains menus for Week 1, Week 2, Week 3 and Week 4. At the end of Week 4 the cycle menu is repeated from the beginning.
	-  A planned, written menu helps to: 
		- save money and time, make shopping easier and reduce food waste.
		- ensure nutrition, variety, and that seasonal foods are included. 
		- You can also identify foods that those in care like and dislike so that future changes can be made.
		- address staff food-preparation skills, kitchen equipment available, storage space, budget and workload balance. 
		- It also allows staff to create a recipe file.
		-  take into account the dietary needs and eating abilities of the persons in care.
		- meet the requirements of the regulations.

- ## **Steps to Plan Your Cycle Menu**
	- **Assemble Menu-Planning Items.** Gather the following menu-planning tools:
		- Menu item suggestions (see Table 1 on the following pages), any recipes, cook books and menu ideas you have as well as a copy of the most recent version of Canada’s Food Guide and/or refer to the Healthy Eating section of this manual 
		- Lists of food likes and dislikes, food allergies and intolerances, special diets ofpersons in care
		- Pencil and eraser, or a computer
		- Blank menu form outlining your sample meal pattern. 
		- Provide for the minimum number of recommended servings of each food group within the given age range that is typical in your home. 
		- The menu should include the week number,your facility name, season and date implemented.
	- **Plan the Main and Light Meals for each of the 28 days of the menu.**
		-  Plan the entrées for each meal.
		-  Plan the starchy vegetable or grain food(s) for each meal.
		-  Plan 1–2 vegetables for each meal.
		-  Select the fruit or dessert for each meal.
		-  Select the beverages (for example, water, milk, juice, coffee, tea, etc), appetizers (for example, soup), accompaniments, garnishes for the meals.
	- **Plan the Breakfast Meals**
		- Choose the meat or meat alternative (for example, egg, nut butters) if needed.
		-  Select the grain products (for example, cooked or cold cereals, toast, pancakes or waffles)
		- Select a fruit or juice, other beverages, condiments (for example, sugar, jam) and garnishes
		- Plan at least two snacks each day, including one evening snack.
		- Plan how you will modify the menu for those with special needs
	- **Review the menu and complete the Menu Checklist**. Here are some things to think about:
		- Is there a variety of colours, food textures (for example, crisp, soft), flavours(for example, mild, sweet, sour), shapes (for example, round, sticks, diced),types of preparation (for example, cooked, raw) and temperatures (that is,hot, cold)?
		- Can the menu be prepared with the staffing and equipment available? Are theworkloads balanced for different shifts?
		- Is any food item repeated too often? Are food patterns avoided (for example, a sandwich for lunch every day)? Is there repetition in foods that appear on the menu at the end of one week and the beginning of the next?
		- Are meals made attractive with suitable garnishes and accompaniments? Will
		- the menu be acceptable to those in care?
		- Is the menu honest? Is the food written on the menu the food actually served?
		- Are familiar and attractive descriptions used
	- **Test the Menu.** 
		- The first cycle of your menu (four weeks) should be tested.
		- Encourage feedback and make any needed changes.


- ## **Developing and Standardizing Recipes**
	- Once you have your menu developed, the next step is to develop a system for your recipes. 
		- Good resources include cookbooks, magazines, food companies, co-workers, individuals living in the small facility and the Internet. 
		- You should test recipes to ensure they meet the needs of those in care. This is called standardizing and provides the advantages of:
			- helping to prepare grocery lists as you know exactly what and how much food to buy. This saves food costs and time.
			- helping staff (especially new people) take the guesswork out of cooking which produces a high-quality product no matter who is doing the cooking.
			- helping identify ingredients for those with allergies or special diets.
			- allowing for nutritional analysis if desired.
	- How Do I Standardize My Recipe?
		- Check your recipe and make sure it is not missing any information (for example,ingredients, instructions).
		- If you need to do any conversions, the following table shows a number of commonmetric/imperial conversions
		- Prepare the recipe and try it out. Did it look and taste good? Was there too much ornot enough? Was everyone able to eat it? If necessary, adjust the recipe (for example, ingredients, measures, cooking time) and prepare it again until you have aproduct that works well.
		- Once the recipe is perfected, it is ready to be put into a standardized format. This includes the name, number of portions, serving size, ingredients, amounts, method,equipment used, cooking time, and cooking temperature. It may also include instructions for diets and texture modifications, if needed. For facilities with food permits, Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) guidelines will also need to be included. An example of a standardized recipe is as follows:




# SECTION 7:  Lunches to Go, Eating Out & Snacks
[[Packed Lunches]]
- ## Lunches To Go
	- lunch that a person in care takes with them should contain all the four food groups. Be sure to also include snacks with bagged lunches. The following provides lunch ideas for each food group
	- Involve persons in care in preparing their lunch. Younger children can do simpletasks such as putting out lunch kits or food containers for packing. Older children and adults can take a more active role.
	* These must be refrigerated to prevent bacteria from growing. Here are some more tips on packing bagged lunches: 
	* Make lunches ahead (try making them after dinner) and refrigerate them. Use an insulated bag with a chilled thermos or carton of frozen juice to keep the food cool.
	* Do not re-use plastic bags as they can be a source of bacteria. Sandwiches can be
	* made ahead of time and frozen without the vegetables. Take them out in the morning and they will thaw in time for lunch. Fillings that freeze well include cheese,roast beef, chicken, turkey, ham and meatloaf
	* Pack a buttered roll and baked or poached chicken or fish pieces, slices of cold meats or a can of sardines or shrimp, or fill a pita bread with hummus and shredded lettuce.
	* Put hot or cold soup (for example, gazpacho, leek and potato), hot or cold beans in tomato sauce or bean, rice or pasta salads in a thermos.
	* Try cold pizza, milk, an oatmeal muffin and a dried fruit strip for something different.
	* Try a more nutritious version of the packaged snack packs by packing whole graincrackers, lower-fat cheese, sliced turkey and raw vegetables in a divided container.Serve with 100% juice.
	* Salsa, hummus, bean dips, or fruit dips with baked chips and veggies or fruit aregood lunchbox choices, since these foods contain more vitamins and fiber
	- If you make your own snack mixes, you can include healthy additions like driedfruits, unsalted nuts, pretzels, and baked crackers

FOOD GROUPS | Ideas for Lunches
---|---
Grain Products | Whole wheat, rye, pumpernickel, cracked wheat, multi-grain bread,bagels or kaiser buns. Try muffins, pita bread, wraps or leftover pasta,rice, couscous, bulgur or quinoa.
Vegetables & Fruit |Fruit juice, canned, unsweetened fruit or fresh fruit (for example,apple, orange, grapes, banana, pear, peach or kiwi). Offer freshvegetables (for example, celery, turnip, zucchini or carrot sticks,cucumber slices, sliced sweet peppers, chopped broccoli orcauliflower, sugar peas or cherry tomatoes) and salads.
Milk & Milk Alternatives| Milk, fortified soy milk, yogurt, milk pudding, tofu dessert, cottage Cheese, hard or processed cheese.
Meat & Alternatives | Peanut or other nut butters, seed butters (for example, sesame,sunflower), hummus*,tuna or salmon*, hard-cooked egg*, roastbeef*, pork*, chicken*, turkey*, ham* or meatloaf*, nuts or seeds (forexample, trail mix) or leftover baked beans*, chili*, stir-fry*, lentilsoup*.

[[Eating Food Outside]]
- ## Eating Out
	- To make healthy choices when eating out:
		- choose foods that are broiled, braised, roasted, steamed, grilled or poached.
		- decide how much to eat prior to the meal instead of during it. 
		- Some restaurants serve much more food than needed. Order a small appetizer or half a meal. If you are served too much, ask for a "take-home package" and use the leftovers for the next day.
		- go easy on the butter and jam you add to bread, toast, muffins, biscuits and pancakes, and on extras like regular gravy, sour cream, sauces made with cream, cheeseand eggs, salad dressings, mayonnaise and tartar sauce.
		-  use the nutrition information available for the menu items to find healthier options.
		-  for those on texture-modified or therapeutic diets, call ahead to order the meal toensure it is appropriate. For puréed and minced modifications, take a hand-held grinder to the restaurant.
		-  look for healthy selections for children on the children’s menu, too. Often they offeralternative sides such as fruit instead of french fries
		-  soft music and lighting contribute to the enjoyment of a meal, but they can influenceyour calorie intake. Instead of lingering over a dessert, enjoy a cup of coffee or tea.

[[Snacks]]
- ## Snacks
	- A good snack helps meet nutrition needs. Two snacks, including one evening snack are recommended.



# SECTION 8: Purchasing Food Wisely
[[Purchasing Food]]
- ## Where to Shop?
	-  Regardless of where you shop, there will be pros and cons. Running between stores for the lowest price on an item may not save money.  In addition, the extra time may be better spent on other tasks. 
STORE | ADVANTAGES | DISADVANTAGES
---|---| ---
WHOLESALE | • generally lower costs for large amounts <br> • orders can be made by phone and goods delivered <br>• labour and time saving• monthly statements/payments<br>|• higher prices are charged if you do not buy the entire case of an item <br>• minimum order required for delivery<br>• need storage to hold large deliveries<br>•ties up money in inventory<br>
RETAIL | • can take advantage of specials, coupons <br>• can hand-select fresh produce and purchase in small quantities <br>• more selection of products and brands<br>• can teach life-skills and contribute to the community<br>| • labour intensive<br>• time consuming<br>• prices generally higher <br>• may not provide delivery service 

- ## General shopping tips to help you purchase wisely: 
	- Check flyers for weekly specials and sales. Use coupons if you can double them or get the name brands for next to nothing. In most cases you can make the item orbuy a generic brand for less. 
	- Buy according to what you will use and can safely store. As a general rule, buy groceries in amounts that can be used up within three months. Check the label for best before dates.
	- Buy less expensive, local, seasonal foods and store brands rather than name brands.
	- Buy larger packages or consider some bulk foods if you will use them.
	- Compare prices of products using unit pricing (that is, cost per unit of weight—forexample, ounces or grams—or volume—for example, fluid ounces or millilitres). 
	- Foods that are unprocessed (for example, fresh vegetables, fruit or meat) orprocessed very little (such as milk, frozen vegetables, rolled oats) are less expensive(and healthier!) than highly processed items (for example, baking mixes, deli meats,prepared cereals)
	- Make a price list. Keep track of the prices on the items you buy most frequently in a small pocket book. Then set a goal to only buy those items when they are at their cheapest. 
	- Ask for rain checks when a sale item is sold out.
	- To save on herbs and spices you might want to grow your own. This could be part of an activity program of the facility.
	- Most foods have satisfaction guarantees on the products. If you do not like a product,return it to the store or call the toll-free number on the back of the box. Many companies will either give you your money back or send you a coupon for another product.

- ## Grocery Lists and Purchasing Foods from Suppliers
	- ### Best Buys and Shopping Tips
		- GRAIN PRODUCTS 
			- Hot cereals such as oatmeal 
			- Breakfast cereals such as 100 Bran, 
			- Grape-Nuts®
			- Rice
			- Breads
			- Pasta 
			- Choose whole grain items that are low in fat, salt and sugar.
			- Choose prepared breakfast cereals with at least 4 grams of fibre per serving and with little or no sugar. 
			- Avoid instant rice, pasta or cereals as they cost more per serving.
			- Compare bread by weight (and number of slices), not size; large loaves are not always cheaper.
			- Consider purchasing day-old bread. It will keep for two months in the freezer and can be used to make bread crumbs and croutons.
		- VEGETABLES AND FRUIT 
			- Fresh vegetables and fruit in season
			- Frozen or canned vegetables and unsweetened frozen or canned fruit (for example, in pear juice) when fresh items are not in season 
			- Frozen unsweetened fruit juices
			- Cabbage, potatoes and root vegetables(for example, carrots, turnips, parsnips)
			- Buy local or store brands.
			- Try shopping at local farmers’ markets in the summertime. 
			- Pick-your-own farms offer you the chance to pick your own at a lower rate than the picked price.
			- Buy standard grades of canned fruit and vegetables or frozen plain vegetables; frozen vegetables in sauce cost more
			-  Compare the cost per serving rather than the cost per kilogram/pound.
			- Grow your own vegetables and herbs. Some herbs such as parsley can be grown all year round.
			- Select small apples and bananas for children rather than larger ones, which may be only half-eaten.
		- MILK AND MILK ALTERNATIVES
			- Skim milk powder
			- Fluid milk in 4 L jugs
			- Block cheese instead of grated or slices
			- Plain yogurt
			- Cottage cheese
			- Evaporated  milk• 
			- Use skim milk powder in cooking (for example, puddings, cakes, casseroles, soups) and evaporated milk to replace light cream in recipes.
			- Buy plain yogurt and add your own fruit or make your own yogurt.
			- Try ice milk. It often costs less than ice cream.
			- Compare the cost of cheese. Those that cost less tend to be processed cheese, mild block cheese and domestic cheese. Do not throw out hardened cheese. Grate it into muffins, casseroles, omelettes, soups and salads.
		- MEAT AND ALTERNATIVES
			- Dried split peas, beans, lentils
				- Tofu
				- Eggs
				- Peanut butter
				- Ground beef
				- Poultry
				- Less tender cuts of meat (for example, pot roast, stewing meat)
				- Canned fish (water packed)• Compare the price per serving rather than the price per pound/kilogram as fat, bone and gristle reduce the number of servings. The parts that you cannot use make good stock for soup.
				-  Tenderize tough cuts of meat by using a wooden or metal mallet, marinating or slow cooking, and use in stroganoffs and curries.
				- Cut up your own chicken. It usually costs less per serving to buy a whole chicken. Canada B and Canada Utility poultry are cheaper.
				-  Be selective with cold cuts (that is, deli meats) as many are high in fat and salt. Cold cuts in bulk (or sliced at the deli counter) tend to be cheaper than pre-sliced or prepackaged meats.

- ## Using Nutrition Labels to Purchase Wisely
	- Contents of a typical nutrition label
		- **Nutrition Facts**
			- This is the title of the label
		- **Specific Amount of Food**
			- Specific Amount of Food. The amount may be indicated by a phrase (for example, two cookies), household units such as ml, cups, tablespoons, or a fraction offood (for example, 1/4 pizza). These are then followed by the metric measure (g, ml).
		- **Daily Value**
			- % Daily Value is based on recommended amounts for a healthy 2000-calorie diet.Foods that contain less than 5% DV (Daily Value) of a nutrient are low in that nutrient. Foods that contain more than 20% DV are high in that nutrient.
		- **Core Nutrients**
			- Core Nutrients. Calories and the same core nutrients are always listed in the sameorder. Some of the key ones are discussed as follows:
				- Calories: Portion sizes influence the number of calories. For example, if thetable has information based on one waffle and you eat two waffles, you need todouble the amount of calories and nutrients listed in order to figure out actualintake.
				- Fat (saturated, trans and other fatty acids): Saturated fat and trans fat haveone combined % DV because both types of fat have negative effects on bloodfats
				- Cholesterol: The amount is listed in milligrams. The label may provide a % DV.
				- Sodium: This may be added to foods through additives such as disodium phosphate, sodium nitrate or sodium gluconate. A healthy diet low in sodium mayreduce the risk of high blood pressure.
				- Carbohydrate (starch, fibre and sugars): Sugars are added to foods as sucrose,brown sugar, maltose, glucose, fructose, dextrose, liquid invert sugar, molasses,honey, maple syrup and corn syrup. Sugars contribute mainly calories and have no nutrition advantages.
				- Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Calcium and Iron: All of these are based on recommended amounts. They are listed only as a % DV.
		- **Nutrition Claims**
			- Nutrition Claims are claims about the amount of a nutrient in a food (for example, "high in fibre")
				- Cholesterol-free : Product has very small amounts (less than 2 milligrams of cholesterol in the amount specified on the label) and is also low in saturated fat and trans flabel) and is also low in saturated fat and trans fat. 
				- Good source of calcium: A serving of the product has 165 milligrams or more of calcium.
				- High or very high source of fibre :Food has at least 4–6 grams of fibre per serving.
				- Light : Only on foods that are either "reduced in fat" or "reduced in energy" (calories). "Light" can also beused to describe characteristics of a food, provided that the characteristic is clearly identified withthe claim (for example, light tasting, light coloured).
				- Low-fat: Food contains no more than 3 grams of fat in the serving size indicated. In a healthy diet, theded range for fat intake is approximately one-third of total calorirecommended range for fat intake is approximately one-third of total calories.
				- Low in saturated fat : Food contains 2 grams or less of saturated and trans fat combined for the specified amount.
				- No added sugar :The product contains no added sugars, ingredients with added sugars or ingredients that contain sugars that substitute for added sugarssugars that substitute for added sugars.
				- Reduced in calories: Has at least 25mg fewer calories than the food it is being compared to.
				- Sodium-free: For the serving size indicated the food contains less than 5 milligrams of sodium.
				- Source of fibre: The food contains at least 2 grams of dietary fibre in the serving size indicated.
				- Sugar-free: The product contains less than 0.5 grams of sugars and 5 calories per serving size.
				- Unsweetened: The product meets requirements for “no added sugar” and contains no sweeteners.
				- Nutrition labels are based on the food as sold and notas cooked.
		- **List of Ingredients**
			- Ingredients are listed in descending order by weight. This information is helpful for those with food allergies or intolerances, or those making lower-fat, lower-sugar or higher-fibre choice
			- Fat ingredients may be listed as oil, margarine, butter, monoglycerides, diglycerides or vegetable lecithin. 
			- Salt may appear as sodium, monosodium glutamate or sodium nitrate.
			- Food additives examples are: BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene), lecithin, sodium nitrite, sulphur dioxide.
			- Fresh products are least likely to contain additives.


# Section 9 : Managing Food Safely
[[Food Safety]]
- ##  Storage Tips
	- Keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold. 
	- Bacteria grow best in the Danger Zone of 4°- 60°C (40°–140° F). 
		- Store foods at the correct temperature:
			- Freezer Never above -18°C (0°F)
			- Refrigerator Never above 4°C (40°F)
			- Dry storage At 10°–20°C (50°–70°F) in a well-ventilated and dry area away from direct light
		- Do not let perishable or cooked foods remain in the Danger Zone. Produce such ascut melons, tomatoes and raw sprouts have been linked with food-borne illness. 
		- These products must be refrigerated. Freeze fresh meat, fish or poultry right away if you cannot use it within two days.
		- Use chilled ingredients when making sandwiches or salads.
	- Avoid bruising fresh vegetables and fruit and overloading refrigerators and freezers.
	- Store opened packages in screw-top or tight-fitting lidded containers.
	- Store raw foods below cooked/ready-to-eat foods. Keep food/food containers atleast 15 cm (6 inches) off the floor. Store cleaning agents and chemicals separatelyfrom food.
	- Chill hot leftovers quickly by dividing them into small portions, using shallow pans,putting them on ice, stirring frequently and refrigerating immediately. Store leftovers in airtight containers or wrap them in moisture-proof material. Label and date leftovers and try to use them within 24 hours.
	- Mark down when floors, shelves, refrigerators and freezers should be cleaned. Anexample form of how to organize food purchasing, preparation and cleaning is provided on the BC government publications website at: www.publications.gov.bc.ca and look up “Forms To Accompany the Meals and More Manual.”
	- Date newly received items with the month and year of purchase. Place new stockbehind old stock to use in order of purchase.
	- Use foods within the maximum storage times (see Suggested Resources).


- ## Food Preparation
	- Do not cross-contaminate. 
		- Never cut fresh fruit and vegetables on a board that was used for preparing raw meats and poultry without thoroughly washing and sanitizing the board first.
	- Avoid soaking vegetables and fruit for prolonged periods before cooking. Prepare fresh vegetables and fruit as close as possible to mealtimes.
	- When possible scrub vegetables instead of peeling them
	- Reduce bruising by using a sharp knife for trimming, cutting and chopping.
	- Cover and refrigerate foods while you prepare other parts of the meal.
	- Once the original bag or box is opened, transfer dry food to airtight containers.
	- Thaw all meat, even cured vacuum-packed meat, in the bottom of the refrigerator.

- ## Cooking
	- Ensure that meats and poultry are adequately cooked. 
	- Do not partially cook one day and finish cooking the next.
	- Some minerals and vitamins are lost when exposed to the air or dissolve in cooking water
	- Cook vegetables whole or in large pieces and with their skins on, where possible, rather than cut up small and peeled. 
	- Use as little cooking water as possible and use the cooking water in soups, sauces and gravies.
	- Keep the cooking time short; 
	- Add vegetables to boiling water and cook until just tender. A better method is to steam vegetables.
	- Skim and discard fat from meat drippings for a healthier meal.


- ## Serving Food
	- Try to limit the amount of leftovers because reheated food will lose vitamins and minerals, flavour and texture.
	- Refrigerate and reheat food for late comers instead of holding food warm for a long time.

- ## Mealtime Clean-Up and Reheating Food
	- Dishes may be cleaned through a dishwasher or hand-washed. Dishwashers require a minimum:
		- wash temperature of 60°C (140°F).
		- final rinse cycle of 10 seconds.
		-  rinse temperature of 77°C (180°F).
	- If you are hand-washing dishes, a three-compartment sink is recommended: one sink to wash (minimum temperature of 44°C (110°F), one to rinse (use hot tap water) and one to sanitize.

- ## Tips for Food Handlers
	- Wash your hands with liquid soap under warm running water 
		- before starting to prepare a meal
		- after going to the washroom
		- after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or touching your mouth, face or hair
		- after smoking or eating
		- after handling raw meat, poultry, fish, eggs or unwashed vegetables
		- after handling dirty dishes or touching boxes or garbage.
		- Wear clean clothes and aprons.
		- Use clean utensils rather than your hands to mix food. If hands must be used when handling ready-to-eat foods, ensure your hands are washed. 
		- Also consider using disposable plastic or vinyl gloves. Do not use latex gloves because they can trigger allergies.
		- Use clean spoons to taste food. Do not put tasting spoons back into the food.

- ## Cross-Contamination
	- Preventing bacteria from hitchhiking from one food to another. 
		- For example, bacteria can cling to a knife and be lifted from one food to the next if used on different foods.
		- Not using cutting boards and utensils for preparing raw meats or poultry and ready to-eat foods.
			- If the same items are used, wash them with soap, rinse them with water and then sanitize between uses. 
			- Let the sanitizing solution stay in contact with the utensil or cutting board for 2 minutes and do not rinse off.
			-  A sanitizing solution can be made by mixing 15 ml (3 tsp.) of 6% bleach into 1 L (4 cups) of water. Prepare a fresh solution daily.
	- Washing and sanitizing dishcloths before they are used to clean surfaces on which ready-to-eat foods will be placed.
	- Storing raw food such as raw poultry, fish and meat in containers that do not leak. These items should be stored on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator to prevent the juices from dripping onto cooked and ready-to-eat foods.

# SECTION 10 :The Dining environment and Mealtime assistance
[[Mealtimes]]
- ## The Mealtime Environment
	- Don’t rush people while eating or drinking.
	- Dining areas should have adequate and appropriate furniture.
	- Tables should be set properly with appropriate dishes, cutlery and special equipment available.
	- Allow for good communication (for example, suitable temperature, ventilation,unnecessary interruptions).
	- Assistance is available for eating and drinking if required.
	- Positive social interaction between staff and persons in care
	- Mealtime Assistance and Eating Aids
	- The optimal position for safe eating and drinking is to sit upright and well supported
	- Stability is important and is achieved when the person is sitting with their feet firmly on the floor, their arms should be resting on the table with elbows bent
	- The person assisting should be sitting at eye level and seated comfortably.
	- Correct positioning after eating is also important. An upright position for at least 30 minutes helps with digestion.

- ## Common Eating Problems
	- **Conditions that affect eating**
		- Drooling
			- Assess for swallowing disorder (see the Dysphagia (Swallowing Disorders) section of this manual).
		- Dry mouth
			- Provide ice chips, frequent sips of water or sugar-free popsicles.
			-  Have the person in care carry a water bottle with them to sip from often
			- Try sugarless candy and gum to stimulate saliva. 
			- Artificial saliva substitutes (for example, Moi-Stir) are available. Consult a physician and/or pharmacist.Provide 
			- moist foods. Moisten dry foods with soft margarine, gravy, sauces or broth.
		- Loss of taste and smell (whichenhances taste)
			-  A mild mouth rinse of 15 ml (1 tsp.) of baking soda dissolved in 1 Litre (1 quart) of room-temperaturewater may be helpful to swish in the mouth before each meal or snack.
			-  If there is a “metallic” taste, try using plastic instead of metal utensils.
			- Try flavouring foods with tart, sour, sweet or unusual flavours such as lemon, citrus, vinegar, pickleditems and spices such as basil, oregano, rosemary, tarragon, mustard, catsup or mint. Make a fruitsmoothie or milkshake with frozen cranberries. 
			- Try adding 5–10 ml (1–2 tsp.) of decaffeinated coffeegrounds to a liquid supplement such as Boost®. Marinate (soak) and cook meats in sweet juices, fruit or dressings (for example, sweet and sour pork).
			- Try rinsing the mouth with cool black or green tea or lightly salted water to “clear” the taste buds before eating.
		- Thick saliva
			- Offer warm liquids like soups, hot chocolate, Ovaltine, broth, tea or warm water to help clear themouth of thick saliva and to wash foods down. 
			- Check with the doctor or pharmacist about preparations to dissolve and stimulate saliva.
			-  Encourage small, frequent meals and snacks throughout the day. If nutritional supplements are needed, consider the use of commercial supplements such as Resource® Fruit Beverage.
			- Whole or high-fat milk may thicken the saliva but it should not be eliminated from the diet. 
			- Try skim milk followed by a hot or clear beverage, foods with cooked milk such as cream soup or puddings, orfortified soy-based beverages.
			- Sugar-free beverages or foods that are slightly tart or carbonated may help thin secretions. Examples are diet lemon-flavoured drinks, iced tea, sherbet, mandarin oranges, pineapple, sour lemon drops,sugar-free lemonade, sugar-free orange-flavoured drinks or sugar-free popsicles. Tolerance may vary, especially if there are sores in the mouth.
			-  Encourage frequent oral rinsing with club soda or a baking soda rinse (1 ml/1/4 tsp. of baking sodamixed in 250 ml/1 cup of water), especially before and after eating.
			-  Caffeine and spicy foods and beverages should be limited as they irritate the mouth.
			- Consider using a humidifier in the home.
	- **Eating and Behaviour Challenges**
		- A person’s eating patterns develop early in life and affected by:
			-  Being exposed to a variety of foods.
			- Role-modelling of desired eating behaviours.
			- The age of the person, temperament, emotional state, health and development.
			- Genetic make-up (for example, preferences for sweet foods).
			- Recognition of hunger and fullness cues.
			- Environmental factors (for example, social context, lighting)
		- Eating and behaviour challenges tend to be more common in children and adults with development delays. 
			- It is important to determine if the behaviour is a concern before a management plan can be started. Situations that may be a challenge include:
				- a change in growth or weight-gain combined with food refusal. 
				- long-term food or texture restrictions resulting in limited intake or not enoughnutrition (for example, restricting iron-rich foods resulting in anemia).
				- delayed feeding skills, such as poor self-feeding.
				- unusual habits such as a compulsive eating, drinking excess fluids, eating largeamounts of frozen food or eating non-foods (for example, dirt, clay).
				- very long or short mealtimes.
				- tantrums, outbursts, throwing food, gagging, spitting out or vomiting at meals.
				- inappropriate moods around food or mealtimes, including anxiety or distress.
				- eating too fast, rumination (that is, chewing repeatedly for an extended period) andregurgitation (that is, bringing up partly digested food).
				- stealing or hiding food.
		- An assessment by a psychologist should answer the following questions:
			- Is there a medical or psychological reason for problem eating?
			- Who is most concerned by the eating problem (that is, the person in care or others)?
			- Are growth or possible nutrition deficiencies an issue? Does food need to be fortified?
			- Are there any oral or physical problems limiting the ability to eat?
			- Is the person presenting a risk to himself or herself?
		- Eating-Behaviour Solutions
			- Offer new foods repeatedly. It is normal for someone to reject a food the firsttime it is offered. Offer the food repeatedly in a supportive way. Sometimes five totem exposures are necessary for a food to be accepted 
			- Provide a happy, safe, relaxed social context at meals. Staff members also provide direct and indirect examples of eating behaviour. Recognition, praise and approval reinforce appropriate behaviour.
			- Are there any distractions at mealtimes? 
			- Has there been a change in medication?
			- Is the person constipated, dehydrated or in pain?
			- Is the person positioned correctly
			- Provide discipline and support.
			- Avoid distractions such as the television so that the person in care can learn normal eating behaviour including recognizing when they are full. 
			- Emotional support, encouragement and affection around eating are important
			- Be responsive. Appropriate responses to readiness and emotional issues promote healthy eating behaviours.
			- Avoid hurrying the person to eat. Children in particular need to register hunger and fullness and enjoy the social aspect of mealtimes.
	- ## Overeating and the Environment 
		- Store tempting foods in less-convenient locations (such as in a basement or top cupboard).
		- Do not leave serving bowls and platters on the dinner table. Keep second servings a safe distance away.
		- Provide sufficient non-food oriented activities during the day. Exercise-based programs such as walking, dancing or playing sport are ideal.
		- Discourage “grazing” by focusing only on food. Have the person eat only when sitting down, and do this at a distraction-free table.
		- Illustrate normal portion control. Pre-serve the portions and allow no “refills.”
		- Repackage foods into smaller containers. Avoid eating straight from packages.
		- Get rid of the cookie jar, or replace it with a fruit bowl.
		-  Make healthier foods more visible. Wrap tempting foods in foil to make them less visible. Place healthier foods in the front of the refrigerator.
		- Avoid multiple bowls of the same food (for example, at parties) because they stimulate eating.
		- At buffets avoid having more than two different foods on a plate at the same time.
		- To discourage overeating in an environment where food is plentiful (for example, ata party), arrange foods into organized patterns.
		-  Use tall, narrow glasses instead of short, wide ones, and smaller bowls, plates andspoons rather than larger ones.

- ## Suggestions for Special Mealtime Activities
	- Birthday Parties and Theme Days
	- Sporting Events
	- Other

- ## Cultural, Religious and Personal Considerations
	- How is food normally served and eaten? On a plate, or in a bowl? With a fork,spoon, soup spoon, Chinese soup spoon or chopsticks? Scooped up with roti?
	- Is food served plain or with sauces? Are vegetables usually served raw, cooked orpickled?
	- Is there a “most preferred” food (for example, rice, noodles, potatoes, soup)? Is thisfood served at every meal?
	- Are there forbidden foods or food combinations? Are there foods that are servedduring illness, or at celebrations?
	- Are dairy products eaten on a regular basis? Are they served hot or cold? Are theycooked with rice or tapioca? Are they served as buttermilk or yogurt?

# SECTION 11 :EMERGENCY PLANNING
[[Food Emergency Planning]]
- Emergency plans for handling disasters will ensure that the needs of those in care continue to be met.
- **Provide safe water and food.**
	- Store 2.5–5 L (½–1 gallon) per person per day. This water will be required fordrinking, food preparation, brushing teeth, other basic hygiene needs and washing dishes.
	- Store an alternative water supply in sturdy, opaque plastic jugs or bottles.
	- Add chlorine bleach (it must contain 5.25% sodiumhypochlorite and be less than one year old) in the amount listed below. Note: this procedure can also be used to purify water during the emergency
		- WATER IS CLEAR
			- 1 L (1 quart) 2 drops
			- 5 L (about 1 gallon) 8 drops
			- 25 L (about 5 gallons) 2.5 ml (½ tsp.)
		- WATER IS CLOUDY
			- 1 L (1 quart) 4 drops
			- 5 L (about 1 gallon) 16 drops
			-  25 L (about 5 gallons) 5 ml (1 tsp)
	- Finish filling the bottle to the very top. Spread melted candle wax around the top of the\rim and screw the lid on tightly
- **Pre-plan, keep it simple and prioritize.**
	- The plans you develop should take into account all types of disasters that include:
		- NATURAL
		- INDUSTRIAL
		- SOCIAL/POLITICAL 
		- FACILITY
		-  Fire
		- Flood
		- Earthquakes
		- Weather
		- Disease outbreak (for example, influenza)
		- Food recalls
		- Hazardous material spills
		-  Heating, water, power disruptions or failure
		-  Explosion
		-  Mid-air crash• Labour disruptions, strikes
		- Civil disturbances,riots
		- Bomb threat or hostage-taking
		- Medication interruptions
		- Disruptions in food service and laundry
		- Sewage backups
		- Search for missing person in care
		- Internal evacuations
	- Make sure you have at least one alternative way to cook your food (for example,camp stove, sterno stove, barbecue, fondue pot, chafing dishes). Never burn charcoal indoors because it could cause carbon monoxide poisoning.

- ## Emergency Menu
	- An emergency menu and food supplies for at least three days should be in place.
	- Keep a supply of canned foods and dry mixes or other foods that require little or no cooking or refrigeration in case utilities (for example, electricity) are disrupted.
	- Store foods that require little or no water for preparation and that will not increasethirst. Liquids from canned foods can be used as water in cooking.
	- Store foods that will meet the needs of those in care requiring special diets. Include foods needed for those on therapeutic or texture-modified diets. For puréed diets,jarred baby foods could be used.
	- Store some of the food in portable containers (for example, in case you need to leave the home). Large ice chests with wheels are a good choice.
	- During the emergency use the foods in your refrigerator. Next use the frozen foods inyour freezer. Canned foods and mixes are used last.

# SECTION 12: Considerations for Children

- As part of meal planning ensure that furniture and eating utensils are suitable so that the children can enjoy mealtimes. 
- Nutrition education for children should be part of thefacility program. 
- ## Lunches to go :
	-  Here are some additional tips for lunch menus:
		- Build a “make-your-own sandwich” pack.
		- Buy a reusable foodsaver with compartments and pack it with vegetables (for example, green pepper, tomato), meat (for example, sliced turkey) and cheese. 
		- Include some whole grain bread or crackers.
		- Kids like the idea of building their own lunch.
		- Pack dry cereal (for example, Cheerios, Shreddies) or breadsticks with lunch insteadof chips.
		- Try pasta or potato salad with added vegetables and cheese.
		- Try putting previously rejected foods in interesting containers: colourful foodsaversor very small baggies may make it seem like a different food altogether.
		- Include an ice pack to keep cold foods cold, or a thermos to keep hot foods hot. Tryan “edible ice pack”: freeze an orange and use it as the ice pack so that by lunchtime the orange will be thawed out and lunch will still be cold
		- You should also provide enough fibre (offer plenty of fruits, vegetables and whole grain items) and fluids (offer plenty of milk, water, pure 100% unsweetened fruit juices).

- ## Common Nutrition Concerns in Children from 1 to 19 Years
	- Toddlers (1–3 years)
		- they do not need adult-size portions. 
			- Servings should be a quarter to a third of the size of an adult portion. 
			- Small, frequent meals should be provided and serving sizes increase with age. 
			- A rough rule of thumb for the serving size of meat is 15 ml (1 Tbsp.) per year in age.
		- Toddlers need more fat than adults to provide energy and help with their nervous system development.
		- For the toddler, provide 1.3 L (about 5–6 cups) of fluids a day 
		- and about 19 grams (about ¾ ounce) of fibre a day.
		- nutrition-related concerns during this life stage include: 
			- Appetite and Picky Eaters
			- Food Allergies and Adverse Food Reactions
			- Weight
			- Risk of Choking
			- Iron Deficiency
	- Preschoolers (4–5 years of age)
		- By this time, most children have all their baby teeth, so they chew most foods. 
		- Fat in thediet is still important for nervous system development.
		- Provide the preschooler with 1.7L (about 6–7 cups) of fluids a day.
		- About 25 grams (1 ounce) of fibre a day is also needed.
		- Sugary, sticky foods should be avoided.
		- Regular brushing should be encouraged.
	- School-Aged Children (6–13 years)
		- Most school-aged children are influenced by peer pressure. 
		- Role-modelling and involving the child in meal preparation help shape healthy eating.
		- Try not to categorize foods as good or bad because this can lead to abnormal views about eating.
		- Sexual development can start between the ages of 8 and 9 years. 
		- This changes nutrition needs for both boys and girls.
		- For boys between 9–13 years provide 2.4 L (9–10 cups) of fluids; 
		- provide 2.1 L (8–9cups) of fluids for girls.
		- Provide between 25 and 31 grams (about 1 to ¼ ounce) of fibre.
		- nutrition-related concerns during this life stage include:
			- Nutrition, Hyperactivity and “Hyper Behaviour”
			- Hyperactivity is not caused by a poor diet, but a poor diet may be a factor in a hyperactive child’s life.
			- Some children may be sleepless, restless and tense due to caffeine found in cola drinks. 
			- Regular sleep times, mealtimes and activity are important.
			- Weight and Body Image
			- Obesity is linked with a lack of activity (for example, watching television, computer use).
			- Females are prone to distorted body image. This can lead to trying diets, restrictingfoods and developing other behaviours that affect their health. Encourage a healthy bodyimage (acceptance of body type).
		- Calcium and Vitamin D
			- Calcium and vitamin D are needed to ensure that bones develop to their full potential.
			- Often soft drinks replace fluid milk or milk alternatives. Diets that are low in calcium tend to be low in other nutrients, so focusing on calcium intake can help to ensure an overall healthy diet.
	- Adolescents (14–18 years)
		- Growth spurts tend to occur in girls around 10–11 years of age and in boys around 12–13 years. 
		- These growth spurts last about 2 years.
		- Their food choices are often related to a desire to achieve a particular body shape, clear up acne or improve their athletic performance.
		- In the case of obesity, for example, excessive dieting, which results in low calcium intake and low body weight, can lead to osteoporosis in later life.
		- Calcium-rich foods include the milk and milk alternatives. Aim todrink at least 3 cups of milk and fluid milk alternatives per day. Calcium is also found in many non-dairy foods, or added to other foods, such as juice, cereal and bread.
		- Iron is needed to replace menstrual losses in girls and to support the growth of muscle in bothboys and girls. 
		- The fluids needs for teenage boys is 3.3 L (13–14 cups) a day and 2.3 L (9–10 cups) a day for girls. This amount includes fluids found in foods. You should offer a variety of fluids; at least 1.5 L (6 cups). Female adolescents need 26 grams (about 1 ounce) of fibre a day for females and male adolescents need 38 grams (about 1 1⁄2 ounces)of fibre a day.
		- Some nutrition-related concerns during this life stage include:
			- Food Choices
			- Weight and Body Image
			- Lifestyle Factors
			- Smoking, alcohol and illegal drug use can also affect nutritional status. 
				- Tobacco influences hunger, weight and nutrition status. Smokers tend to eat less fibre, vitamin A, Beta-carotene, folate and vitamin C. It can also increase the need for certain nutrients(for example, vitamin C)
			- Pregnancy
				- Adolescents who become pregnant tend to have nutrition challenges. Many healthregions have prenatal nutrition programs for high risk pregnant moms including adolescents. Contact the health region office for more details.
