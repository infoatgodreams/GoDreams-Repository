Growth charts: A diagnostic tool
Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Hirabai Cowasji Jehangir Medical Research Institute, Jehangir Hospital, Pune, Maharashtra, India
Basics of growth charts and importance of
anthropometric measurements are described. A comparison between growth standards and references is provided. Further, Indian
growth reference curves based on the data collected by Agarwal et al. and adopted by the Indian Academy of Pediatrics, World Health
Organization growth standards for children under the age of 5 years (2006) and contemporary Indian growth references published
on apparently healthy affluent Indian children (data collected in 2007-08) are discussed.
Results and Conclusions:
For the assessment of height, weight and BMI, WHO growth standards (for children < 5 years) and contemporary cross sectional
reference percentile curves (for children from 5-18 years) are available for clinical use and for research purposes. BMI percentiles
(adjusted for the Asian adult BMI equivalent cut-offs) for the assessment of physical growth of present day Indian children are also
available.
LMS values and Microsoft excel macro for calculating SD scores can be obtained from the author (email: vamankhadilkar@

The
previously available growth reference curves in India were
based on the data collected by Agarwal et al. in 1989 which
were published in 1992 and 1994 and were then adopted by
the Indian Academy of Pediatrics for growth monitoring
in 2007.

Standard growth
chart has 7 percentile lines and include 3rd, 10th, 25th, 50th,
75th, and 97th percentiles. These percentiles are standard
for height and weight charts. Any individual who is below
3rd and above 97th percentile is considered out of normal
range. For the BMI charts, however, there are 85th and
95th percentile lines which indicate overweight and obesity
cut offs.
Proportion charts use Z score lines instead of
percentile lines and discrepancy of more than 2Z scores in
the upper and lower segment is considered abnormal
On
the growth velocity chart, 25th percentile is the cut off line
for defining low height velocity.
Growth charts mainly belong to two types: growth standards
and growth references. Growth standards are prescriptive
and define how a population of children should grow
given the optimal nutrition and optimal health. Growth
references on the other hand are descriptive and are
prepared from a population which is thought to be growing
in the best possible state of nutrition and health in a given
community. These describe the growth of children at that
time. They represent how children are growing rather than
how they should be growing.
The correlation between Z
scores and percentiles can be confusing and in the recent
WHO Multicenter Growth Reference (MGRS) 2006 study,
these correlations have been spelt out by the WHO and
are given the Table 1 below for clarity of understanding.
WHO 2006 growth charts for children under 5 years is an
example of growth standards. They delineate how children
of the world under the age of 5 years should grow if most
of the controllable variables are kept optimal as opposed
to this 1989 Agarwal et al.,[3] data and 2007 Indian growth
charts by Khadilkar et al.,[7] for affluent children are an
example of growth references which describe how children
in India were growing at the given time.

Advantage of having a growth standard such as WHO
2006 charts is that children of all countries, races, ethnicity
can be compared against a single standard thus assessment
becomes more objective and easy to compare. The
disadvantage of using charts such as these is that they are
likely to over diagnose underweight and stunting in a large
number of apparently normal children[8] in the developing
countries such as India.
Advantage of a reference is that they are true representative
of the existing growth pattern of children and allow us
to study the secular trend in terms of height, weight, and
obesity. The downside of reference curves is that they need
to be updated at least once in a decade and in modern times
as obesity is on the rise they are likely to define overweight
children as normal

WHO recommends using -2Z (3rd percentile) scores
for diagnosis of stunting and underweight and -3Z
(1st percentile) for the diagnosis of severe stunting and
severe underweight.
Use of WHO 2006 growth charts are likely over diagnosed
stunting or underweight or both in developing countries. In
a recent multicentric study done on 1493 affluent preschool
Indian children (selected from all zones of India) published
by the author the Mean Z scores for height, weight, BMI,
and weight for height (-0.75(1.1), -0.59(1.1), –0.19(1.22)
and -0.26(1.18), respectively) were below the WHO 2006
standards. The overall incidence of stunting was 13.6% and
underweight was 8.5% amongst affluent Indian children
under the age of five years. This percentage is likely to be
higher in rural areas and in under privileged urban areas
although at the present time no such data is available from
India.
