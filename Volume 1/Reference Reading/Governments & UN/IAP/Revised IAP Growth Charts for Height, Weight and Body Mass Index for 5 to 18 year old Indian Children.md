# ** Scope:** 
- The Growth Chart Committee was formed by IAP in January 2014 to design revised growth charts. 
-  Studies performed on Indian children’s growth, nutritional assessment and anthropometry from upper and middle socioeconomic classes in last decade were identified. 
- Committee contacted 13 study groups; total number of children in the age group of 5 to 18 years were 87022 (54086 boys). Data from fourteen cities (Agartala, Ahmadabad, Chandigarh, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kochi, Kolkata, Madurai, Mumbai, Mysore, Pune, Raipur and Surat) in India were collated.
-  Data of children with weight for height Z scores >2 SD were removed from analyses. Data on 33148 children (18170 males, 14978 females) were used to construct growth charts using Cole’s LMS method.
- For children between 5-18 years of age, WHO has stated that it would not be possible to have prescriptive growth standards because environmental variables in this age group cannot be controlledfor;hence, charts by the WHO for 5-18 year old children are based on statistical reconstructionof 1977 National Centre for Health Statistics data and are called growth references and not standards. There is no national consensus on which charts to use
- Total children between the age of 5 and 18 was 87022 (54086 males) (south 61173, center 3253. east 4507. north 7405 and west 10684)
	- 143 children out of 61173 from south were randomly selected 33991 (18630 males) were used in the final analysis. 197 children removed as above or below 5 SD on CDC chart as obvious outliers Out of remaining 33794, 646 (329 males) children were removed as they were above + 2 z score for weight for height
- Growth charts were constructed on 33148 children referencing following publications: 
	- Cross-sectional Growth Curves for Height, Weight and Body Mass Index for Affluent Indian Children, 2007[11]indian Pediatrics 2009 
	- Mysore Childhood Obesity Study Indian Pediatrics
	- Determinants of Overweight and Obesity in Affluent Adolescents, Indian Journal of Community Medicine in Surat City, South Gujarat Region, India [17]
	-  Body Mass Index Cut-offs for Screening for Childhood Overweight and Obesity in Indian Children Pediatrics
	-  Prevalence of Obesity and Overweight in Urban School Children in Kerala, India , indian Pediatrics
	-  An anthropometric study on the children of Tripura :Nutritional and health coverage and redefining WHO percentile cut-off points, International Journal of Scientific and  Research publications, international Journal20139498

# **Key Conclusions:**

- Comparing the final height and weight data with recent international studies from China, Saudi Arabia, WHO and CDC, it is clear that Indian children are growing almost at par with Chinese and Saudi Arabian children but are still shorter and lighter than their Caucasian counterparts [7,27,28,29]
- Further, Indian children’s stature seems to be comparable to Caucasian children until the onset of pubertal years, however, the growth spurt after puberty is attenuated in Indian children in both sexes, the effect being more pronounced in girls.
- Thus, the average difference in height between Caucasian girls and Indian girls from 5 to 11 years of age is only about 1 cm; however this gap widens to6 cms at 18 years.
- Similar figures in boys are 1 cm from the age of 5 to 12.5 years and 3.5 cm at 18 years. Interestingly, Chinese children also show a very similar growth pattern suggesting that this is possibly a characteristic of Asian children [30]. These finding are of particular relevance in interpreting target height and predicting final adult height based on prediction equations, thus stressing the need for ethnic specific growth charts.
- The IAP Growth Chart Committee recommends these revised growth charts for height, weight and BMI for assessment of growth of 5-18 year old Indian children to replace the previous IAP growth charts; the rest of the recommendations for Monitoring height and weight remain as per the IAP guidelines published in 2007. To define overweight and obesity in children from 5-18 years of age, adult equivalent of 23 and 27 cut-off lines as presented in BMI charts here may be used.
- IAP recommends use of WHO Multistandards Growth Reference Study for assessment of children under the age of 5 years.
