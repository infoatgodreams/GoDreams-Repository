Scope: The document outlines alternatives to institutional care based on - -  that infants were at a great risk for developmental difficulties and a quick death when placed in institutions (Chapin (1915, 1917; Gray, 1989) was one of the first researchers to conclude this)

# Child Welfare Systems in High Versus Low-Resource Countries 

High-resource countries, in support of the substantial evidence showing that family-based care is better than institutional placement, typically emphasize a family-based system of child protection. (Page 3)

In contrast, the foundation of most child welfare systems in low-resource countries is primarily institutional care or informal kinship care.

# Supporting families to reduce institutionalization

## Types of Poverty Reduction Strategies

- Cash transfers (CTs), one antipoverty strategy, are income maintenance programs designed to support families

- CT can be of two types.
	-  Unconditional cash transfer allocates cash with no expected behavior ofthe receiving family/household; a family is given money with the expectation that themoney is used to keep children in families and to help children develop. - 
	- Conditional cash transfer dispenses cash conditional on an expected behavior of the beneficiary, such as taking parenting classes, regular visits to a health clinic for the child, or enrollment of the child in school.

- A South African study of a CT program reported significantly positive nutritional changes among young children (Aguero, Carter, Woolard, 2007).
-  A Brazilian CT program led to an increase in girls’ education attainment decreased participation in child labor practices for boys (De Carvalho Filho, 2000), an improvement in girls’ health and nutrition (Duflo, 2003), and better height outcomes (Aguero et al., 2007).



## Family Assessment
[[Restoration]]


- (Page 7) Assessments should place priority on cases where preservation or reunification is likely to happen rapidly, putting more resources in these cases (Kelley, 2000).

- These specialized assessments could be for developmental issues of the child, mental health problems, the use of alcohol or other drugs, or challenges and disabilities that affect parenting. The recommendations arising out of specialized assessments must be incorporated into the service plan.


# Kinship Care

- Programming for successful kinship care should include the following services:

	- Financial support, including benefits, vouchers, CTs, and in kind payments.

	- Access to healthcare, including prevention, treatment, and rehabilitative services (e.g., for HIV and AIDS, drug and alcohol abuse, and disabilities).

	- Education, formal and informal, for caregivers.

	- Early intervention for children in high-risk situations. r Access to daycare and respite care, especially in the case of children with disabilities.

	- Support groups and parenting classes that provide psychological support to caregivers; training in key topics such as crisis management, child nutrition, and child development; and, psychosocial services including direct work with children.

	- Monitor and support community based organizations that have a core team of community volunteer caregivers. These caregivers receive training and then provide support to households with chronically ill members, placing specific focus on child safety, health, development, and school attendance.

# Foster Care

- Informal foster care is a private arrangement made between the two families. Informal foster care is practiced in many countries, especially in Africa.

- Specialized foster family care provides for children with special needs

- Crisis foster care is used when there is an emergency and the child requires temporary care

- Key best practices in foster care are stability; confidentiality; respect of the cultural, linguistic, and spiritual identity of the child, foster family, and biological family; and a multidisciplinary team approach to assessment, case management, case planning, and support for foster families (

# Domestic Adoption

- Specific best practices for domestic adoption include

	- Trained and certified social service workers in the areas ofchild development and adoptive family assessment to provide home study evaluations and case management services in the preand postadoption periods.

	 - Specific policy guidelines and safeguards pertaining to adoptive parent eligibility centering on effective parenting capacities, adoption orientation and training, and postadoption follow-up monitoring to determine the well-being ofthe family and adoptive child.

	- Efficient systems related to declarations of adoption eligibility for children in need ofpermanent families to ensure that permanency is prioritized and placement of children into adoptive families occurs as soon as legally possible, thus preventing prolonged institutionalization.

	- Registry of children available for adoption, with necessary confidentiality and dignity safeguards, that provides efficient information for adoption service providers to match children with adoptive families.

	- Regulations and procedures that prioritize prospects for domestic over ICA (Hague Convention). These can include licensing for ICA based on proven commitment and practice of domestic adoption, time period during which children are on adoption registries where only domestic adoption is allowed (note, this should not be a prolonged period recognizing the negative impact that lack of permanent family-based care has on children of being outside of permanent family care), and low fees or subsidized costs for domestic adoption based on adoptive family’s income.

	- Well-documented and stored history of the adoptive child by service providers, including information on biological family and birth community, health conditions, and information regarding caregivers after birth parent separation

	- Establishment of adoptive family and adoptee associations for mutual support, critique, advice, and advocacy for best practices. 
	-  Development and implementation of public education campaigns, including use of mass media, to promote the need for adoptive families and to overcome cultural stigmas associated with adoption. 
	- Ongoing interdisciplinary workshops, trainings, and forums to ensure best practices and adoption system reforms, recognizing that multiple sectors (i.e., legal, social welfare, philanthropy) are involved in adoption. 
	-  Consideration and design of an amnesty program for families that have informally adopted children to come forward and legalize adoptions to ensure greater openness in adoption and child protection.
	- Capacity and incentives of the non governmental sector to support and provide domestic adoption services. The NGO sector can leverage additional funding to drive best practices and often provide more sustained service experience than governmental sector.
