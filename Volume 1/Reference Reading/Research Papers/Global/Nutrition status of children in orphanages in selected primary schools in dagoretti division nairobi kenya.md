The sample consisted of children who were equally distributed between age 4 and 11 years.Indicators of malnutrition were assessed against potential independent variables such as variety of foods consumed, energy intake, disease prevalence, vaccination rates, hygiene practices and duration of stay in the orphanage.Overall there were thirty three caretakers with one orphanage having eleven, the second ten and the third twelve caretakers. These were employed on full time basis to take care of the children in the orphanages. The majority (51%) of the caretakers had attained post primary education.
This cross sectional study was conducted between November 2009 and February 2010 in children between 4-11 years representing three out of the six government registered orphanages from Peri-urban primary school children in Dagoretti Division, Nairobi Kenya.

# Survey Tool and Methods

A structured questionnaires was used to collect demographic which included, age, sex and educational level of the caretakers of the orphanage children. Data on period of stay in the orphanage, morbidity occurrence, health seeking behaviour and common types of foods taken was also collected from caretakers of orphanage children .

Anthropometric data, which included, height, weight and age was collected from orphanage children. Date of birth was obtained from the orphanages’ records. EPI INFO (Version 3.3.2) was used to calculate Height-for-age (HAZ), Weight- for- age (WAZ) and Weight- for Height (WHZ) Z-scores. Children with HAZ, WAZ and WHZ scores between -2.99 and -2.00 were considered to have moderate stunting, underweight and wasting respectively, while those with -3.00 and below were severely stunted, underweight and wasted respectively [16].

The most documented form of malnutrition in Kenya are protein energy malnutrition and vitamin A deficiencies among under-fives [10,11]
Malnutrition in orphanage children is completely lacking in National surveys. 
In Malawi, 64 % of orphanage children were stunted compared with 46 % of the non orphanage children [12].
In Zimbabwe a strong association was found between living in an orphanage and nutritional and health outcomes such as diarrhea, acute respiratory infection, and underweight status among 5-10 year old children. In the same study orphanage children were more wasted ((9%) compared to non-orphanage group (2%)


Children can exhibit catch up growth if their environment improves. This suggests that interventions for school age children can supplement efforts in the preschool years to reduce levels of stunting


Underweight among school age children can reflect prenatal under nutrition, deficiencies of macro- and micro- nutrient, infection and, possibly inadequate attention by care givers

Wasting is not as common as either stunting or underweight in school age children

The orphanage children who attended school away from the orphanage had two meals (Breakfast and Supper) in a day during
school days and three meals (Breakfast, Lunch and Supper) during the weekend. These comprised 50% of all the orphanage children.


The cereals food group contributed the highest amount by weight (497.3 g) and proportion (34.2%) to the total diet for the orphanage children. Fruits 0.7% (10.1 g) and spread 0.1% (1.7 g) made a small contribution to the orphanage children’s dietary intake. Plantain and Eggs were completely lacking in their diet. A total of 37 food items were consumed by the orphanage children (Table 2). Only 7.2% of orphanage children consumed more than four food groups while majority, 92.9% consumed less than four food groups (t=20.4, df=207, p=0.000). 


The total mean energy intake among the orphanage children who took lunch was 1547 Kcl. The mean energy intake of orphanage children who did not take lunch was almost half (868 Kcl) of those who took lunch. Breakfast contributed the lowest mean energy intake for the day (11.2%). Lunch (44%) and supper (45%) contributed similar proportion of mean energy intake. 


The total nutrient intake was computed and compared to the recommended daily allowance for each age set and by sex of children
[17] these were 1352 and 1698 Kcl for 4-6 and 7-9 year age groups, whereas for the 10-11 year group, they were 2326 Kcl for girls and 2824 Kcl for boys. Overall 37.1% of the children took adequate energy calories (Table 3)
The boys had a higher rate of stunting (26%) and wasting (4.8%) compared to girls (stunting, 21% and wasting, 4.3%). Girls (36%) had a higher rate of underweight than boys (33%). These differences were not significant at p<0.05 (Table 4)



Food groups | Amount consumed from each food group (g) | contribution to the total diet(Percentage) 
------------ | ------------ | -------------
Cereal based grains ( Ugali, maize and beans, Rice, Chapattis, bread,porridge) | 497.3 |  (34.2%)
Vegetables (cabbage, Kales, spinach) | 227.1 | (15.6%)
Legume grains ( Beans, Green grams, Lentils) | 232.1 |  (16%)
Dairy (Fresh or fermented milk)| 147.7 | (10.2%)
Eggs | 0 | (0%)
Meat (chicken, fish, beef)| 66 | (4.5%)
Fruits| 10.1 |  (0.7%)
Spread (margarine, butter, fruit jam)| 1.7 | (0.1%)
Sugar| 29.7 |(2%)
Tea/Cocoa|231.3| (16%)
Plantain|0 |(0%)
Tubers and Roots ( Irish potatoes, Sweet potatoes, Carrots)|11.0 |(0.8%)
Total|1454 |(100%)




- The proportion of stunted, underweight and wasted children was inversely and significantly (p<0.05) correlated with children’s energy intake, variety of foods and washing hands with soap. 

- Diarrhoea and colds/cough and duration of stay in the orphanage were positively and significantly correlated to the prevalence of stunted, underweight and wasted orphanage children
-  Prevalence of malnutrition seemed to increase in  proportion with
increase in length of stay in the orphanage (Figure 1). These differences were significant (X2=1, df=3, p=0.000) for stunting and underweight but not significant (X2=0.79, df=3, p=0.50) for wasting.

- The children in the three orphanages suffered from various infections whose symptoms included 
	- colds/flu, 
	- diarrhea, 
	- vomiting, 
	- fever and 
	- skin rashes. 
	- The children who had been sick in the previous seven days comprised 33 % of the total number of orphanage children.


This study also concurs with 1999 micronutrient survey, which reported a relatively low consumption of fruits in Kenya

# Morbidity
- Prevalence of morbidity was significantly higher (t=2.61, df=206,p=0.005) among boys (27.9%) than girls (13.5%) ages 4-7 years.
- Similarly, prevalence of morbidity was also significantly higher (t=2.56, df=206, p=0.006) among boys (18.3%) than girls (6.7%) ages 8-11 years.
- Of the orphanage children ages 6-11 years, 48% reported washing hands after visiting the toilet, 49.4% washed hands before meals and 12.8% washed hands with soap during the critical times, the day before the interview. [Hygiene](Roll%20Ups/Hygiene/Hygiene.md)


# Calorific Intake
- Deteriorating standards of living, disease prevalence and increase in food prices could have contributed to the high prevalence of under nutrition. 
	- The high dependence on cereals and legume grains could have resulted in extremely high phytate and fiber content of these diets thus rendering the energy nutrient bio unavailable [30].
	- Similarity among the low cereal consumption and its highest contribution to the proportion of the total mean weight of foods consumed was not unexpected, since the community agricultural activities had declined due to urbanization.

- The calories (less than 12% of the daily energy intake) derived from **breakfast**; equivalent to four slices of bread was too low to enable the children to perform adequately until lunch. 
	- This suggests that the children were hungry for a great part of the morning. Supper was a more important source of energy (45%) compared to lunch (44%).
	- Even for the children who took lunch, the overall energy intake did not improve much, as indicated by the study data: with lunch 1547 Kcl, without lunch 869 Kcl. 
		- These findings are similar to the Pakistan study which observed that orphanage children had lower intakes of caloriesfor breakfast (less than 10%). 
		- Similarly, in this study supper was a more (54.7%) important source of energy compared to lunch (34.6%) for orphanage children [22]. 

- The proportionately high contribution of **lunch and supper** to daily energy intake implies that more emphasis was placed on these two meals than on breakfast.
	- Only 37% the orphanage children met their energy requirements. 
		- This proportion of children is lower compared to the Western Kenya findings where 63.7% of school children met the recommended daily energy allowance


- **The number of meals** served to a child is important in promoting growth. Foods given in adequate portions and frequently foster better health and growth in children than bulky and rare servings [25].
	- The average child up to 11 years of age needs to eat every 4-6 hours to maintain a blood glucose level sufficient to adequately support physical and mental activities [26]


- **Foods that provide the body with adequate nutrients** to support all the functions are associated with good health
	-  It could therefore be suggested that for those children whose energy intake fell below the recommended, they were at risk of suffering form nutritional deficiencies. 
	- The children who did not meet energy requirements possibly were given small amounts of food. 
	- They could also have been the children who only took two out of the possible three main meals of the day. 


## CCI Diet Components
- The orphanage diet consisted of 37 different foods. This diet was dominated by basic staple foods supplemented by complimentary foods usually, in form of stews.
	-  Staples such as maize and rice were observed as sources of energy among the orphanage children.
	-  It was further observed that there was a tendency towards exclusive reliance on starches and legumes.
- Majority 92.9% of the orphanage children were served meals with less than four food groups.
	- Only a small (7.2%) proportion of the orphanage children were served meals with four or more food groups. 
	- These results are similar to a Pakistan study which found 6.5% of orphanage children consumed four or more food groups [22].
	- Conversely, another study in Western Kenya found that all the children in the study consumed four or more food groups [18]. 
	- The consumption of a varied diet is associated with increased intake of energy and better health [24].
	- Children may be served with large servings of starchy cereals because they are bulky thus giving satiety value


The quality and quantity of food given to a child is very important. 


# Stunting

- The higher stunting rate among the orphanage children was also associated with
	-  lower levels of energy intake
	-  low variety of food
	-  washing hands with soap rates
	-  longer duration of stay in the orphanage, 
	-  higher prevalence of diarrhea and
	-  colds/cough and
	-  older children
	- These findings concur with the study in Zimbabwe where stunting rates of orphanage children were directly correlated to length of stay in the orphanages [27]. 
	- Another study in North Western Tanzania found higher stunting levels among orphanage children and this increased with increase in age of the children [28]

- The factors that could have contributed to high prevalence of stunting among the orphanage children included :
	- limited varieties and diversity of foods served to the orphanage children,
	- the few meals taken in a day, inadequate energy intake,
	-  the over dependence on cereals which have low bioavailability and provide poor quality nutrients and
	-  the high prevalence rate of disease among the orphanage children
	- The high levels of stunting could imply that children received inadequate care from the caregivers (fathers, mothers or childhood caregivers) which include food, healthcare and emotional support necessary for the healthy growth and development of children

# Underweight
- Underweight rate was also high among the orphanage children and this was also associated with 
	-  longer duration of stay in the orphanage and 
	- higher prevalence of diarrhoea and colds/cough.
	- Underweight among school children can reflect prenatal under nutrition, infection and possibly inadequate attention by care givers [19]

- These finding are similar to the Zimbabwe study which found a negative correlation between age of children and prevalence of underweight [13].
	- Another study in Nicaragua found a direct relationship between prevalence of underweight among orphanage school children and diarrheal, coughs/colds and length of stay in the orphanage [29].


# Wasting
- Orphanage children were more likely to be wasted and this was associated with lower levels of energy intake, variety of food and washing hands with soap rates. They were also more likely to be wasted and this was associated with high levels of diarrhea and cough/colds rates
	- The high prevalence of wasting in this sample could have resulted from the high prevalence of diarrheal and cough/colds resulting in reduced appetite for food. 
	- Possibly, some children suffered from more than one infectious disease thus culminating in this high rate of nutritional wasting. 
	- They could also have suffered acute food crisis thus becoming severely malnourished.

# Gender and Malnutrition
- Boys had a higher prevalence rate of stunting and wasting than girls.
	- On the other hand girls had a higher rate of underweight than boys
	- However these rates were not significantly different.

- The higher levels of stunting among boys could have been contributed by high prevalence of disease among boys which could also be associated to the low rates of hand washing at critical times.
-  Inadequate energy intake among the orphanage children could have contributed to the high stunting levels among boys than girls mainly because boys (above 10 years of age) require more food than girls of the same age [17].

- It could also be explained by the fact that more girls than boys were involved in food preparation and therefore likely to consume more food than boy’s overtime. Further, since stunting increases with age, it is likely that more boys than girls were stunted in their childhood. 

# Length of Stay 
- The orphanage children who had been admitted to the orphanages for a longer period were more likely to be stunted and underweight (p<0.05) than those who had been recently admitted. 
	- These findings differ from those of the study in Malawi where children who had been admitted to an orphanage for more than one year were less malnourished [36] than those who had been admitted for a shorter time. It could also imply that nutritional care in the orphanage is less than optimal, resulting in chronic long term malnutrition
