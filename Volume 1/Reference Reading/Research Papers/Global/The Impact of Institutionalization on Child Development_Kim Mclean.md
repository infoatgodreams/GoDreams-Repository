Scope: This article reviews via a meta analysis, the impact of institutionalization on the following areas of child development: physical development; developmental milestones, intellectual development,and academic achievement; behavior problems; indiscriminate friendliness; and attachment. Evidence on the persistence of or changes in the behavior, its relation to lengthof institutionalization, and its correlates are also presented.(Page 3)


 # Interventions

 - (Page 4) Such interventions included pro viding sensory stimulation (Broussard & De carie, 1971), placing infants as “houseguests” with older residents (Skodak & Skeels, 1945, 1949), and improving child to caregiver ratios (Hunt, Mohandessi, Ghodessi, & Akiyama, 1976). All of these studies showed that simple changes within the orphanage environment creased children’s developmental competence. 

# Successful Institutionalization
-  Further support for the idea that institutionalized children were not destined for developmental compromise came from the work of Barbara Tizard and her colleagues with children who had spent the first 2 years of their lives in high-quality institutions in the United Kingdom (Tizard, 1977).
	-  In these institutions the child to caregiver ratios were 3:1 and the were taken on outings, and were fed well.
	-  The major way in which orphanage children’s lives differed from the lives of home-reared children was that caregivers were discouraged from forming intimate relationships with them (Tizard & Tizard, 1971). 
	- Tizard and Joseph (1970) first assessed children in the institution when they were 2 years old and compared them to a sample of home-reared children from a working class background. They found that the institution children’s IQ scores were only slightly lower than those of the working class children and that their language was only slightly delayed. 
	- At age 4.5 the mean IQ of the children in an institution was in the average range and no language problems were found (Tizard & Rees, 1974). 
	- Hodges and Tizard (1989) reported that children adopted from the institution had normal IQs at 8 and 16 years of age. Tizard’s findings were more positive than the findings of the earlier search, but it is important to note that the children in Tizard’s sample had not experienced the extreme deprivation experienced by earlier samples of children  (e.g., Goldfarb, 1945a)
