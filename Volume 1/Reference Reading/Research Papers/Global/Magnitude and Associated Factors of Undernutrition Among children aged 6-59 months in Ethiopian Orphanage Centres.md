# Scope: 

- This study aimed to assess magnitude and associated factors of undernutrition among children aged 6–59 months in Ethiopian orphanage centres.
- Institution-based descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study was conducted on 227 children aged 6–59 months in selected orphanage centers of Addis Ababa, Ethiopiafrom July to August 2019.
- The mean (SD) age of the children in the orphanage was 36 (SD ± 12) months. Seventy-nine (34.8%) of the OVC (orphans and vulnerable children) children had stayed in the orphanages for a period of between 12 and 23 months while those who had stayed for 24 to 35 months were 67 (29.5%) (Page 4)
- A small percentage of 14 (6.2%) had stayed for ≥36 months. The mean (SD) duration of stay in the orphanage was 19.3 (SD ± 10.2) months. One hundred eighty-six (81.9%) of the children were double orphans and the rest were either maternal or paternal orphans. (Page 4)


# Results Summary: 

- Being a double orphaned child [AOR= 2.9 (1.201, 7.167)] and lack of vitamin A supplement in the last six months (AOR=1.9 (1.049, 3.799) were significant predictors of stunting
-  Illness in the last two weeks before the survey [AOR= 4.9 (1.345, 1.865)] was a significant predictor of wasting.
- Majority of children in orphanages are nutritionally challenged because of many factors including the fact that they have never been breastfed or exclusively breastfed, low rates of vaccination, and basic hygiene.

- Being a double orphaned, lack of vitamin A supplement, and illness in the last two weeks were associated with undernutrition.

- In some cases, children are kept unhealthy conditions to appeal to donors and volunteers. (Page 2)

- There are an estimated total of 87 child care institutions located in seven mainregions of Ethiopia.

# Survey Tools & Methodology
-   Data was collected using :
	-  structured interviewer administered questionnaires, 
	-  document review, and 
	-  anthropometric measurements (height and weight).
-  Information obtained included 
	-  Socio-demographic factors of children, 
	-  Orphan status (single orphan, double orphan),
	-  duration of stay of children in the orphanage,
	-  immunization status,
	-  Vitamin A supplement, and 
	-  morbidity status of the children.
	-  child health cards,
	-  birth certificates, 
	- and other available documents were used to ensure recording the actual age of the child 
	- and other relevant information including the date of entry to the orphanage, to verify if the child joined other institutions before coming to the current orphanage centers was looked at
- Children were considered to have received all basic vaccinations (According to the guidelines developed by WHO.) when they have received a vaccination against :
	- tuberculosis (also known as BCG), 
	- DPT HepB-Hib (also called pentavalent) vaccine, 
	- vaccines against polio, 
	- and vaccination against measles
- Illness in the last two weeks was assessed from the record whether a child has had symptoms of the following over the last two weeks : 
	- cough, 
	- diarrhea, and 
	- fever.

Prevalence of wasting : 4.4%
underweight, and stunting was 4.4%, 12.3%and 34.8%,
respectively.

# Wasting
- Prevalence of wasting : 4.4%
- The odds of wasting among OVC who had the illness before 2 weeks were 4.9 times an increased risk than OVC who did not have an illness. This due to illness may result in lower appetite, poor digestion, and malabsorption which leads to at least one parent alive. (Page 6)
- This finding was similar to the study in the rural community of Hawassa, Mygoma orphanage center, Khartoum, Sudan, and Tangle, district of Bangladesh which showed a significant relationship between occurred disease type and wasting.

# Stunting
-  Prevalence of stunting : 34.8%
- The prevalence of stunting in this study was a high public health problem according to the WHO’s classification for public health significance.
- Children who did not take **Vitamin A supplement** in the last six months had a 1.9 times greater risk of stunting in comparison with children who took the recommended dose. 
	-  In contrary to this, a study by Panpanich in Malawi orphanages and Dagorti division of Kenya which showed no significant relationship between wasting with illness. A randomized controlled trial in Northern Ghana found no significant association between vitamin A supplementation and linear growth of children. 
	- The reason for the discrepancy might be due to the difference in lifestyle and economic status of the countries, or other factors in the environment
		- For example, a randomized controlled study among pre-school Indonesian children, found that vitamin A supplementation improved linear growth. **Additionally, this effect was higher among children who were not breastfed.**
		- This suggests that **vitamin A supplementation may be protective against stunting, or may reverse stunting.**
- Regarding orphan status, there was a significant **association between children who were being doubled orphaned and stunting.** Double orphaned children had a 2.9 times greater risk of stunting in comparison with those who had a single parent. They were  also more likely to be malnourished and short for their age.
