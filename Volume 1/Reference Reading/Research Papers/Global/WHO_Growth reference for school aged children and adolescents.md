# Scope
-  To construct growth curves for school-aged children and adolescents that accord with the WHO Child Growth Standards  for preschool children and the body mass index (BMI) cut-offs for adults. 
	- Methods Data from the 1977 National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)/WHO growth reference (1–24 years) were merged  with data from the under-fives growth standards’ cross-sectional sample (18–71 months) to smooth the transition between the  two samples.
	- The new curves are closely aligned with the WHO Child Growth Standards at 5 years, and the recommended adult  cut-offs for overweight and obesity at 19 years. They fill the gap in growth curves and provide an appropriate reference for the 5 to 19 years age group.

- They also agreed  that a multicentre study, similar to the  one that led to the development of the  WHO Child Growth Standards for 0 to  5 years, would not be feasible for older  children, as it would not be possible to  control the dynamics of their environment. - 
	- Therefore, as an alternative, the experts suggested that a growth reference  be constructed for this age group using existing historical data and discussed the criteria for selecting the data sets.

- The reference previously recommended by WHO for children above 5  years of age, i.e. the National Center for  Health Statistics (NCHS)/WHO international growth reference,4 has several drawbacks.
	-  In particular, the body mass  index-for-age reference, developed in 1991 only starts at 9 years of age, groups data annually and covers a limited percentilerange.
	-  Many countries pointed to the need to have body mass  index (BMI) curves that start at 5 years  and permit unrestricted calculation of  percentile and z-score curves on a continuous age scale from 5 to 19 years

- The total sample size was 22 917  (11 410 boys, 11 507 girls). For the indicator height-for-age, 8 boys (0.07%),  including an 18 month-old with length  51.6 cm, and 14 girls (0.12%) had  outlier height measurements that were  set to missing in the data set. For the  weight-based indicators (i.e. weightfor-age and BMI-for-age), the same  cleaning approach used for the construction of the WHO Child Growth  Standards (cross-sectional component)  was applied to avoid the influence of unhealthy weights-for-height.10 As a  result, 321 observations for boys (2.8%)  and 356 observations for girls (3.0%)  were excluded
	


# Measurement Tools

Instructions: [Field Measurement Guide](https://www.who.int/childgrowth/training/module_c_interpreting_indicators.pdf)
## BMI

- BMI measurements are then further subcategorized into 
	- Obesity( >2 Standard Deviations), 
	- Overweight (between 1 &2 SD) ,
	-  Normal (0), 
	- Thinness (between -2 and -3 SD) 
	- Severe thinness (below -3)
