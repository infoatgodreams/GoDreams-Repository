- Scope:  To construct growth curves for school-aged children and adolescents that 
accord with the WHO Child Growth Standards  for preschool children and the body mass index (BMI) cut-offs for adults. Methods Data from the 1977 National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)/WHO growth reference (1–24 years) were merged  with data from the under-fives growth standards’ cross-sectional sample (18–71 months) to smooth the transition between the  two samples.

- The new curves are closely aligned with the WHO Child Growth Standards at 5 years, and the recommended adult  cut-offs for overweight and obesity at 19 years. They fill the gap in growth curves and provide an appropriate reference for the 5 to 19 years age group.
