# Scope
-  To construct growth curves for school-aged children and adolescents that accord with the WHO Child Growth Standards  for preschool children and the body mass index (BMI) cut-offs for adults. 
	- Methods Data from the 1977 National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)/WHO growth reference (1–24 years) were merged  with data from the under-fives growth standards’ cross-sectional sample (18–71 months) to smooth the transition between the  two samples.
	- The new curves are closely aligned with the WHO Child Growth Standards at 5 years, and the recommended adult  cut-offs for overweight and obesity at 19 years. They fill the gap in growth curves and provide an appropriate reference for the 5 to 19 years age group.

- They also agreed  that a multicentre study, similar to the  one that led to the development of the  WHO Child Growth Standards for 0 to  5 years, would not be feasible for older  children, as it would not be possible to  control the dynamics of their environment. - 
	- Therefore, as an alternative, the experts suggested that a growth reference  be constructed for this age group using existing historical data and discussed the criteria for selecting the data sets.

- The reference previously recommended by WHO for children above 5  years of age, i.e. the National Center for  Health Statistics (NCHS)/WHO international growth reference,4 has several drawbacks.
	-  In particular, the body mass  index-for-age reference, developed in 1991 only starts at 9 years of age, groups data annually and covers a limited percentilerange.
	-  Many countries pointed to the need to have body mass  index (BMI) curves that start at 5 years  and permit unrestricted calculation of  percentile and z-score curves on a continuous age scale from 5 to 19 years
