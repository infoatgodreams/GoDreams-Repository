# Scope
- Naunihal Children’s Home for Girls is a Children’s Home run by Prerana to provide shelter to girl children in need of care and protection. 
- It is located in the Raigad district of Maharashtra, India and thus falls under the jurisdiction of the CWC, Raigad. 
- Primarily, the resident girls living in Naunihal (and such other similar Shelter/Children’s Homes) are the ultimate beneficiaries of this note. 
- The Superintendents of such Children’s Homes, Counsellors, Social Case Workers, Probation Officers, Child Welfare Officers are expected to be the primary users of this note routinely the child steps out of Naunihal to attend her study classes and/or vocational training program and comes back to Naunihal.
- Only children who are over the age of 15 attend such educational and/or vocational courses unaccompanied by caregivers from Naunihal. It is to be assumed that a CNCP attends any educational and/or vocational training program after approval has been obtained from the concerned CWC.

 - Initiate a discussion with the child on the importance of trusting an individualafter obtaining information about the person and the situation.
