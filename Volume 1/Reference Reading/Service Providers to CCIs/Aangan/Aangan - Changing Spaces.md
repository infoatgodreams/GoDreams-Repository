# Admission Processes
- 58% of children felt lost and alone at the time of admission. On the other hand, 42% were angry and aggressive. The others were homesick, depressed or confused. (Page 18)
- Local NGOs and volunteers can be brought in to do entry-level sessions with new admissions where creative processes (art, craft, music etc.) are used. This will help in welcoming, re-assuring and making the child comfortable in the institution. 
- Institutional staff should create a comprehensive piece of communication and assign a resource to ensure that new admissions are thoroughly oriented.
- Intake case sheets can be reviewed to make them as close-ended as is advisable. Also, they can break the information gathering process up over 2-3 sessions, so the child does not feel pressured to divulge too much information in one shot.
- Frequent sessions should be scheduled by the PO for new admissions along, especially in the first 2/ 3 weeks.
- Children should be informed at the time of their entry itself about the chain of communication to be followed in case of conflict as well as the rules & regulations
- The child must be given a brief orientation about the institution wherein a lot of the confusion that he/she has initially is cleared. 
- Rather than merely providing information, it would help if the staff also reassured the child; built rapport and showed empathy.
- The PO is also overloaded with paperwork and the intake-sheet process is time-consuming and not comprehensive. 
- Also once the intake-sheet interview is over, no subsequent sessions are held in the initial weeks where his/her emotional and behavioral problems are addressed.

# Discipline & Child Safety

- Important components of the child’s psycho-social rehabilitation such as staff interaction with the child during his stay; interaction with peers; communication with the child’s family; follow-up after release etc. are not structured.
	- Absence of comprehensive rehabilitation plan.
	- Discipline (Conflicts with staff and peers; physical & sexual abuse; running away; monitors; contraband)
		- Child-friendly material should be created along with capacity building workshops for staff on how to use this material at the time of the child’s entry. The objective would be to welcome and reassure the child and prepare him/her for the interview with the PO.
		- As POs are often overworked and the interview process is time consuming, interview guidelines can be standardized with regard to the duration and number of meetings, monitoring of the case etc. The PO could be trained for special counseling techniques and could divide children into cases and groups based on relevant themes like entry-level, impulse control etc.
		- The child’s emotional and behavioral issues are highlighted in the first few weeks of stay. In order to reduce the rate of running away, whether due to fear or depression, it is suggested that the child’s initial stay routine be standardized to include bi-weekly meetings with the PO. Subsequently these meetings will be reduced to once a week once the child has settled down. These meetings should specifically bring up issues related to homesickness, peers and running away. The PO must also maintain a chart wherein he can keep track of the number of sessions he has had. He can divide his week in a way that he can conduct counseling sessions (individual as well as group), go for home visits and also devote time for documentation. (Page 24)
		- Platforms such as weekly Bal Panchayats can be provided to children to air their grievances, along with individual meetings for serious or personal issues such as sexual abuse.
		- NGOs can be brought in to provide counseling through creative and therapeutic activities.
		- Increasing security for the perimeter.
		- Enhanced security for children and visitors especially in cases who are known to be trouble-makers or indulge in drug-abuse.8.Implementation of the discipline code. In severe cases of physical or sexual abuse the PO could also conduct group sessions with the perpetrators on relevant themes.
		- Make sure that interaction between staff & children takes place as prescribed in the monitoring tool.
		- The institution can ask local psychologists and psychiatrists to assist in special cases. Besides, they can establish a referral system with nearby local government and private hospitals. (Page 25)

# Restoration 
- .Superintendents, POs :Confusion regarding the status of their case be it CICL or CNCP 
- Homesickness or conflicts with peers
- Lack ofcommunication between the child and his/her parents which increases the confusion. 
- Lack of general knowledge; access to the world outside. When the child is released (s)he has no idea about goings on in the world outside
		- Volunteers can be brought in to assist with letter writing, telephoning and contacting the child’s family during a designated period of time regularly and under staff supervision.
		- The visiting hours must be fixed and one member from the staff should be assigned the task of guiding and briefing the parents and relatives.
		- Monthly meetings must be held with the parents which can also act as a grievance  redressal forum for them
		- Newspapers, monthly debates/discussion, news (if there are televisions (Page 26)
