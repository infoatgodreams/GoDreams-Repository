# Brief
-   **Scope & Description:** This study examines rates of potentially traumatic events and associated anxiety and emotional/ behavioral difficulties among 1,258 orphaned and abandoned children in 5 low and middle-income countries. The study quantifies the types of events the children experienced and demonstrates that anxiety and emotional/behavioral difficulties increase with additional event exposure.

# Summary

p. 1

More than the loss of a parent: potentially traumatic events among orphaned and abandoned children

 As policies for orphaned and abandoned children are being implemented, this study helps policy makers and providers recognize that: (a) children and caregivers are willing to report experiences of potentially traumatic events; (b) those who report such events are at higher risk for experiencing additional events; (c) resulting symptomatology indicates a need for appropriate mental health services; and (d) male children are as vulnerable as females, indicating an equal need for protection

p. 2

studies do not quantify the types of events that orphaned and abandoned children are exposed to, or whether they are associated with increased emotional and behavioral difficulties that may make it difficult to succeed in school and acquire life skills for adulthood.

Childhood exposure to potentially traumatic events has been demonstrated in numerous studies to be associated with anxiety, depression, and antisocial behavior patterns that last into adulthood (Koenig, Doll, O'Leary, &amp; Pequegnat, 2004; Matshalaga &amp; Powell, 2002) and can lead to high-risk behaviors, increased risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV/AIDS, and reduced health promotion activities (Whetten, Reif, Whetten, &amp; Murphy-McMillan, 2008). Exposure to such events in childhood has also been linked to distrust of governments and systems of care later in life (Whetten et al., 2006).

Differences by sex and orphan status are examined and comparisons are made with a small sample of children living with both parents, drawn from the same geographical areas.

The study uses data from the Positive Outcomes for Orphans research study which assesses the wellbeing of children who were orphaned or abandoned in six diverse sites in five low and middle-income countries (Whetten et al., 2009)

ix sites from five low and middle-income countries (Cambodia, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Tanzania) were selected for their cultural, historical, ethnic, religious, political, and geographic diversity: Battambang District, Cambodia; Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Hyderabad, India; Nagaland, India; Bungoma District, Kenya; and Kilimanjaro Region, Tanzania.

The Positive Outcomes for Orphans study employed a two-stage random sampling survey methodology to identify a sample of 1,480 orphaned and abandoned children, ages 6-12 at baseline, who were living in family dwellings

p. 3

Although the Positive Outcomes for Orphans study also enrolled a sample of children residing in institutional care settings, those children are not included in analyses for this manuscript, which focuses on community exposure to potentially traumatic events. Enrollment and baseline data collection were conducted over a 6 to 8 month period at each site between May 2006 and February 2008

The Life Events Checklist was created by the National Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) to facilitate the diagnosis of PTSD

p. 4

The Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist – Specific (PCL-S) was used to measure anxiety

The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire is a brief behavioral screening tool applicable to children 3-16 years old, used to assess behavioral and emotional difficulties and prosocial behavior (Goodman, 1997)

The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire has five subscales: Emotional Symptoms, Conduct Problems, Hyperactivity/Inattention; Peer Relationship Problems, and Pro-Social Behavior

Household characteristics were assessed using the World Bank's Child Needs Assessment Toolkit (World Bank, 2008),

p. 5

he average age of the sample at the 36 month follow-up assessment was 11.5 years (SD = 1.85); 53% were male (Table 2). One-third had experienced the death of a mother, and 75% the death of a father, with an average of 7 years since the death of a parent. Sixty-three percent of children lived with a biological parent, 21% with grandparents, 13% with aunts and uncles. Nearly 3% lived in child-headed households (not shown). The average age of the primary caregivers was 42.5 years (SD = 13.4). One-third of the sample was living in rural areas.

p. 6

Nearly all children experienced at least one additional potentially traumatic event beyond the death of a parent or abandonment (98%), with more than half experiencing 4 or more events (55%). The non-orphan sample experienced fewer event categories than the sample of orphaned and abandoned children, yet 87% reported at least one event; 13% experienced 4 or more types of events. Death of a family member (79%), physical and/or sexual abuse (70%), and witnessing family violence (50%) were the most commonly reported events. One third of children reported a potentially traumatic event during the past year. Sex was not predictive of abuse. Abandoned children were most likely to experience physical and/or sexual abuse (84%), followed by double orphans (79%). Double orphans were most likely to have witnessed family violence (59%) and to have had to leave home (42%). War, riots or killings were experienced by one-quarter of the sample

There was little difference in rates of potentially traumatic events, rates of repeated exposure, or the number of event categories by sex.

There was a significant difference in the mean number of reported event categories between children cared for by a biological parent (3.47) versus other children (3.81; p &lt; 0.001, not shown)

Experiencing a past event predicts experiencing such an event in the future (Table 4). For example, reporting having experienced physical or sexual abuse at the baseline assessment strongly predicted reporting such an event during the year preceding the follow-up assessment. The relationship was statistically significant for three of the five potentially traumatic event categories evaluated.

Nearly all children experienced at least one potentially traumatic event in addition to the death of a parent or abandonment.

Sensitivity analyses suggest significant differences in the strength of the association between potentially traumatic events and mental health symptomatology across study sites, by age, and whether the caregiver is the biological parent (less symptomatology), but not by sex, household wealth, or whether the child was a single or double orphan (not shown).

p. 8

Researchers are beginning to identify interventions that can be adapted to less wealthy nation settings to ameliorate the mental health symptomatology resulting from potentially traumatic events (Lin, Sandler, Ayers, Wolchik, &amp; Luecken, 2004; Verdeli et al., 2003).

Double orphans are considered the most vulnerable children (Huang and Panza, 2009) and appear in this study to be most negatively affected by repeated exposure to potentially traumatic events.
