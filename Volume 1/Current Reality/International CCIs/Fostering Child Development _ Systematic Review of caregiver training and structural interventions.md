# Scope: (Pages 1,3,5)

The 24 intervention studies included in this systematic review reported beneficial effects on the children’s emotional, social, and cognitive development. Yet, few studies focused on effects of interventions on the child–caregiver relationship or the general institutional environment. Moreover, our review revealed that interventions aimed at improving institutional care settings have largely neglected violence and abuse prevention. Unfortunately, our findings are partially limited by constraints of study design and methodology.

In order to obtain qualified intervention studies for the analysis, we searched electronic literature databases (Medline, PubMed, PsycInfo, PSYNDEX, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) using the following search terms: ‘‘child care institution’’ (OR ‘‘orphanage,’’ ‘‘children’s home,’’ ‘‘institutional care,’’ ‘‘residential care,’’ ‘‘group care’’), AND ‘‘intervention’’ (OR ‘‘reorganization,’’ ‘‘training,’’ ‘‘changing,’’ ‘‘improving,’’ ‘‘modification,’’ ‘‘stimulation’’), AND ‘‘orphans’’ (OR ‘‘child,’’ ‘‘infant’’), AND ‘‘care quality’’ (OR ‘‘child care,’’ ‘‘care condition,’’ ‘‘caregiver’’), AND ‘‘development’’ (or ‘‘behavioral changes,’’ ‘‘attachment’’).

After full-text analysis, we excluded an additional five studies. In total, we identified 23 intervention studies within 21 articles fulfilling all inclusion criteria

Following this search strategy, we identified the abstracts of 124 studies.

Following an a priori protocol, all studies were analyzed according to the following inclusion criteria: empirical studies with children as participants; studies with controlled and uncontrolled research designs, the presence of a control group composed of children living in the same institution or in comparable conditions; interventions with children aged 0–17 years living full time in child care institutions in any part of the world (studies assessing formerly institutionalized children or children in foster care were excluded);

Most of these interventions were provided by external specialists and did not involve the caregiving staff of the target institution.

The 24 included studies examined interventions that were conducted in child care institutions in 15 different countries on 5 continents

Most authors implemented their intervention in one institution; only three studies compared several institutions within the same study

Interventions took place in state-run and private institutions.

The included studies incorporated a total of 1,253 children. The age of the children ranged from below 4 weeks (Espie´ et al., 2011; Hunt, Mohandessi, Ghodssi, &amp; Akiyama, 1976; Kim, Shin, &amp; White-Traut, 2003) to 16 years (Hermenau, Kaltenbach, et al., 2015; Hermenau et al., 2011),


# Effects of sub-optimal child care
- Children may develop a low-quality attachment bond or even lack an attachment relationship altogether in the absence of adequate care

- Taken together with the experience of violence and abuse, this lack may impact the child’s stress response system, and, in this way, the development and structure of the brain as well. These changes to neurodevelopment may lead to mental health problems, such as depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and internalizing and externalizing problems

- individuals with a history of early institutional care showed more academic difficulties and deficits in social skills, such as maintaining trustful interpersonal relationships (Frank, Klass, Earls, &amp; Eisenberg, 1996; Merz, McCall, &amp; Wright, 2013).

- child maltreatment has been related to epigenetic changes in the stress response axis (Hecker, Radtke, Hermenau, Papassotiropoulos, &amp; Elbert, 2016; McGowan et al., 2009)

- Usually, the child care institutions are able to offer basic provisions of food and shelter, but they lack adequate means to offer sensitive, child-oriented care, possibly leading to the emotional and physical neglect of many children (Oliveira et al., 2012; Vashchenko et al., 2010)

- the reported worldwide rates of violence against children in institutional care were 6 times higher than those of children living in family-based foster care

# Outcome Measurement

The most frequently applied instruments were the Cattell Infant Intelligence Scale (Cattell, 1940) and the Denver II (Frankenburg &amp; Dodds, 1990), both measuring intelligence and developmental quotients.

# Summary of Findings

Critical Findings: 
1. Structural interventions and caregiver trainings contribute to an improvement in children's living conditions in institutional care
2. Training of caregivers and structural changes have beneficial effects ont he children's development
3. The prevention of physical and emotional abuse in institutional care has widely been neglected
4. More efforts are needed to focus on the improvement of general caregiving environment, caregiver child relationship and maltreatment prevention

Implications for Practice, Policy and Research
1. Board, theory based approaches are needed and should be tested using rigorous scientific standards
2. Responsive non-violent caregiver-child interactions are crucial to children's physical and behavioral develpmnet
3. Beyond improving caregiver-child attachment, caregiver trainings should also focus on prevention of violence and abuse in institutional care
4. Improving the quality of care may be more important than the type of care (eg. institutional care vs foster care)

- Our findings have shown that less than one third of the intervention approaches were theory based, and only three studies applied manualized interventions. Therefore, we advocate for developing theory-based and manualized training concepts for institutional caregivers that may be based on attachment and that can be tested using rigorous scientific standards. [Caregiving](Roll%20Ups/Caregiving/Caregiving.md)

- One promising approach that is theory based and manualized is [[FairstartGlobal]] (www.fairstartglobal.com). It is a curriculum rooted in attachment theory that promotes appropriate caregiver–child interactions and relationships. Its unique benefits include free availability on the Internet, implementation flexibility, administrator and staff involvement in creating its implementation, translation into 26 languages, and current implementation in numerous countries around the globe (McCall, Groark, &amp; Rygaard, 2014; Rygaard, 2010). Yet, its effectiveness still needs to be evaluated.

- Many of the intervention approaches included in the studies ofthe present review have some important components in common: They all aim at improving the caregiver–child relationship (attachment and bonding), enriching the caregiving environment through additional stimulation and quality time, and at least some focus on preventing maltreatment and further harm.
