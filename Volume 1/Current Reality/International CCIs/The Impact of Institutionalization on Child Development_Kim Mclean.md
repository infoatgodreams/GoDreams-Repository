**Scope:** This article reviews via a meta analysis, the impact of institutionalization on the following areas of child development: physical development; developmental milestones, intellectual development,and academic achievement; behavior problems; indiscriminate friendliness; and attachment. Evidence on the persistence of or changes in the behavior, its relation to lengthof institutionalization, and its correlates are also presented.(Page 3) Interventions included pro viding sensory stimulation (Broussard & De carie, 1971), placing infants as “houseguests” with older residents (Skodak & Skeels, 1945, 1949), and improving child to caregiver ratios (Hunt, Mohandessi, Ghodessi, & Akiyama, 1976). All of these studies showed that simple changes within the orphanage environment creased children’s developmental competence. 


# IQ
[Education](Roll%20Ups/Education/Education.md) [IQ](IQ.md)

-  Further support for the idea that institutionalized children were not destined for developmental compromise came from the work of Barbara Tizard and her colleagues with children who had spent the first 2 years of their lives in high-quality institutions in the United Kingdom (Tizard, 1977).
	-  In these institutions the child to caregiver ratios were 3:1 and the were taken on outings, and were fed well.
	-  The major way in which orphanage children’s lives differed from the lives of home-reared children was that caregivers were discouraged from forming intimate relationships with them (Tizard & Tizard, 1971). 
	- Tizard and Joseph (1970) first assessed children in the institution when they were 2 years old and compared them to a sample of home-reared children from a working class background. They found that the institution children’s [[IQ]] scores were only slightly lower than those of the working class children and that their language was only slightly delayed. 
	- At age 4.5 the mean [IQ](IQ.md) of the children in an institution was in the average range and no language problems were found (Tizard & Rees, 1974). 
	- Hodges and Tizard (1989) reported that children adopted from the institution had normal [IQ](IQ.md)s at 8 and 16 years of age. Tizard’s findings were more positive than the findings of the earlier search, but it is important to note that the children in Tizard’s sample had not experienced the extreme deprivation experienced by earlier samples of children  (e.g., Goldfarb, 1945a)
- Dennis (1973) followed children from a Lebanese orphanage after they were adopted and compared the developmental outcomes of children adopted at different ages. He claimed that children who had been adopted before 2 years of age eventually regained normal IQs whereas those who were  adopted after 2 years of age showed permanent deficits in IQ. Although this claim has often been cited, it has not been adequately tested
- Both sets of literature clearly demonstrate that institutionalization early in  life has a negative impact on intellectual development and that it is not only institutionalization but also the length of institutionalization that is important.  Most of the recent information we have concerning the impact of institutionalization on intellectual development has been the result of the 1989 overthrow of the Ceausescu regime in Romania, after which the world be came aware of thousands of children being housed in Romanian state-run orphanages.
	- Shortly after the revolution, Kaler and  Freeman (1994) were able to assess children  within the orphanage context.They conducted cognitive assessments on 25 children ranging  in age from 23 to 50 months who resided in a Romanian orphanage and compared them to same age peers from a Romanian kindergarten class. Apgar scores that were available for 13 of the children indicated that they had normal births. Using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (Bayley, 1969), Kaler and Free  man (1994) found that none of the orphanage  children were functioning at their age level, and **20 of the 25 children functioned at levels  that were less than half their chronological  age.**
- Sloutsky (1997) assessed differences in IQ scores between 6- to 7-year old children reared in a Russian orphanage and children of the same age reared at home and found that the **orphanage children scored  lower in IQ than home-reared children.** Other researchers have been able to evaluate the intellectual development of previously institutionalized Romanian children after the profound intervention of adoption. These two  projects, which are ongoing and have now followed children up to 8 or more years after adoption, have provided the clearest information we have regarding intellectual development in post-institutionalized children. 
	- The first  project, in British Columbia, Canada, comprised an initial sample of 46 Romanian children who had spent at least 8 months (range =  8–53 months) in a Romanian orphanage (orphanage group) prior to their adoption to Canada, when they were a median 18.5 months  old (range = 8–68 months); 29 children who would have gone to orphanage in Romania had they not been adopted prior to 4 months of age (early-adopted group); and 46 Canadian-born, nonadopted, never institutionalized children (Canadian-born group) who were individually matched on demographic characteristics to children in the orphanage group (Ames, 1997). 
	- The second project (Rutter &  the ERA Study Team, 1998) comprised a sam  ple of 165 children adopted to the United  Kingdom from Romania between birth and 42  months of age. Most of the children, but not  all, had been adopted from orphanages. These  children were compared to 52 children who  were adopted within the United Kingdom before 6 months of age.
- Morison et al. (1995) found that 78%  of orphanage children were **delayed in all four  areas of development (personal–social, gross  motor, fine motor–adaptive, and language development)** assessed by the Revised Denver Prescreening Developmental Questionnaire ([[R-DPDQ]]; Frankenberg, 1986) [Assessment Tools](Roll%20Ups/Assessment%20Tools.md)
	- Rutter and his colleagues reported similar findings with their sample of adoptees in the United Kingdom (Rutter & the ERA Study Team, 1998).By 11 months postadoption, improvement was evident in the Canadian sample (Morison et al., 1995).
	-   The length of time that children spent in the orphanage was positively associated with the number of areas of delay on the R-DPDQ and negatively correlated with children’s scores on the adaptive, personal–social, and language scales of the Gesell. In addition to the length of time in an institution, the availability of toys and having been a favorite in the institution were associated with fewer delays and higher scores on the Gesell scales, whereas being described as dirty when first met by parents was associated with more delays and lower Gesell scores (Morison et al., 1995) 
-   Three years postadoption these researchers  Morison & Ellwood, 2000) evaluated children’s intellectual development using the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition [[SB4]]: Thorndike, Hagen, & Sattler, 1986). [Assessment Tools](Roll%20Ups/Assessment%20Tools.md)
	-  IQ results were analyzed separately for orphanage children who had been adopted before and after they were 2 years old. In comparing IQ scores among the younger children, who were 4.5  years old when assessed, Morison and Ellwood (2000) found a clear ordering among the groups, in which 
		-  the Canadian-born group  cored highest (M = 109),
		-  the early-adopted children scored in the middle (M = 99), 
		-  and the orphanage children scored lower (M = 91).  The orphanage children adopted at later ages 24–60 months old) had the lowest IQs of all M = 68)
		-   Le Mare, Vaughan, Warford, and Ferny hough (2001) conducted a later follow-up of  the Canadian sample, when the children were  9.5 years old or older. The pattern of group  results remained consistent with the earlier  findings.
- Not unlike their earlier performance on the [[R-DPDQ]], the scores of later-adopted children were lower across all scales of the [[SB4]]  (i.e., overall IQ, verbal comprehension, and nonverbal reasoning) at both 3 years after adoption (Morison & Ellwood, 2000) and 8 years after adoption (Le Mare et al., 2001). 
	- Rutter and colleagues used the [[Genera Cognitive Index of the McCarthy Scales]] (Mc Carthy, 1972)and reported a similar ordering  among their groups of 4-year-old (Rutter &  the ERA Study Team, 1998) and 6-year-old  children (O’Connor, Rutter, Beckett, Keaveney, Kreppner, & the ERA Study Team, 2000) [Assessment Tools](Roll%20Ups/Assessment%20Tools.md)
-  **The importance of length of institutionalization for IQ is also supported by several re-ports of negative correlations between the two variables**: r = -.75 3 years after adoption (Morison & Ellwood, 2000), r = -.48 at age 6 years (O’Connor, Rutter, Beckett, et al., 2000), and r = -.44 at 8 or more years after adoption (Le Mare et al., 2001).
-   A study of  children reared in Greek orphanages in which  conditions were far superior to the conditions  found in Romania found lower academic performance among 9-year-old orphanage children compared to same gender and age peers  living at home (Vorria, Rutter, Pickles, Wolkind, & Hobsbaum, 1998). Le Mare et al.
	-   In addition, 12%  of orphanage children adopted before 2 years  of age and 60% of orphanage children adopted after 2 years of age had repeated a grade. 
	- Le Mare et al (2001) concluded however that even though many orphanage children were struggling within the school context, a noticeable number of them were functioning well within the average range academically. 
-   Morison and Ellwood (2000) found that not only institutionalization but also the home environment contributed to children’s IQ scores 3  years after adoption. Children’s home environments were measured using the [[Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment]] (HOME; Caldwell & Bradley, 1984). [Assessment Tools](Roll%20Ups/Assessment%20Tools.md)
-  Another common finding is that both conditions in orphanages and conditions in adoptive homes can modify the amount of cognitive deficit. Children do better if they are reared in better quality institutions (e.g., those studied by Tizard, 1977) or in institutions in which perceptual or social environments have been enriched.

# Physical Development
[Physical Health](Roll%20Ups/Physical%20Health/Physical%20Health.md)

-   Dana Johnson and colleagues (Johnson et al., 1992) examined the medical condition of 65  previously institutionalized Romanian children who were adopted to the United States. 
	- They found that only 15% of these children were  considered physically healthy at the time of adoption. Convergent evidence for this finding comes from the Romanian children adopted to Canada (Fisher et al., 1997).
	-  In this sample, 85% of children had a reported medical problem
- Similarly, Hostetter, Iverson, Thomas,  McKenzie, Dole, and Johnson (1991) found that at least one medical problem was reported for a majority of children adopted from 15 countries in East and South Asia, Central and South America, Africa, and the Caribbean and Pacific Islands. 
- Fisher et al. (1997) found that according to their parents’ reports orphanage children’s most common medical problems when they were first adopted were
	-  intestinal parasites (31% of children),
	-  hepatitis B (28% of children) 
	-  anemia (15% of children). 
	- These medical problems are consistent  with those noted by other researchers who have examined medical problems in previously institutionalized children from Romania (Benoit, Jocelyn, Moddeman, & Embree, 1996; Gyorkos & MacLean, 1992; Jenista, 1992;  Marcovitch, Cesaroni, Roberts, & Swanson, 1995) and from several other countries (Hoksbergen, 1981; Hostetter et al. 1991). 
-  Previously institutionalized children are typically small and malnourished after the orphanage experience. [Nutrition](Roll%20Ups/Nutrition/Nutrition.md)
	- Eighty-five percent of  orphanage children in the Canadian sample below the 10th percentile and 59% of children fell below the 5th percentile for weight (Morison et al., 1995). 
	- In another group of 16 Romanian children adopted to Canada, 50%  were below the 5th percentile for weight and  44% were below the 5th percentile for height (Benoit et al., 1996). Similarly, in the U.K
	-  In the UK sample of Romanian adoptees, Rutter and the ERA Study Team (1998) reported that half of  the children had heights, weights, and head  circumferences below the 3 percentile.
	-   In several studies growth retardation in height has been shown to be associated with the  length of time that children had spent in institutions (Ames, 1997; Johnson et al., 1992;  Rutter & the ERA Study Team, 1998). 
-   The only physiological measures that have been examined are cortisol levels (Carlson &  Earls, 1997; Gunnar et al., 2001) and patterns  of brain glucose metabolism (Chugani et al.,  2001). 
	- Substantial preclinical evidence that disturbances in caregiving early in life alters development of the HPA axis and its central releasing hormone (Sanchez, Ladd, & Plotsky, 2001)
	-   Both hyper and hypocortisolemia can have negative effects on health and behavioral functioning  (McEwen, 1998)
	-   The first study to examine cortisol level among orphanage children was conducted b  Carlson and Earls (1997). They measured ambulatory cortisol levels in 2-year-old children residing in a Romanian orphanage and compared them to a sample of 2-year-old family reared children. Carlson and Earls found tha  orphanage children’s cortisol levels were not elevated as compared to family-reared children. 
	-   Family-reared children displayed the typical pattern: 
		- cortisol levels were highest in the early morning and decreased over the day  
		- Orphanage children, on the other hand, did not display this pattern; indeed none of the children they studied exhibited the typical diurnal pattern of cortisol production. Noon levels of cortisol were positively correlated with delays in cognitive functioning in the orphanage group. Carlson and Earls (1997) suggested that orphanage experience disturbs the diurnal pattern of cortisol production but does not result in increased levels of cortisol concentrations overall.
		-   Chugani and colleagues (2001) examined brain dysfunction in ten 7- to 11-year-old  children who had spent on average 38 months  (range, 16–90 months) in a Romanian orphanage prior to their adoption to the United  States. 
		-   Chugani et al. (2001) found lower glucose  metabolism in several areas of the brain among  Romanian adoptees than in either the adult or  child comparison groups. They suggested that  the decreased brain glucose metabolism likely  resulted from the Romanian adoptees’ experience of early deprivation and may be one explanation for the cognitive and behavioral deficits seen in many previously institutionalized  children.
		- The reader is cautioned that early  deprivation in Chugani et al’s sample appears  to have included an unusually high frequency  of physical abuse. Chugani et al. (2001) reported that 5 of the 10 Romanian children they assessed had physical scarring that appeared to have resulted from lacerations, burns or broken bones. [Child Safety](Roll%20Ups/Child%20Safety/Child%20Safety.md)
		-  It is possible therefore  that the brain dysfunction found by Chugani  et al. (2001) may be at least partially related  to pain and fear beyond the levels typical of institutional life

# Behavior Problems
[Caregiving](Roll%20Ups/Caregiving/Caregiving.md)

- Goldfarb (1943b) found that previously institutionalized 6- to 8-year-old children who had been placed in foster care at age 3 scored higher on behavior problem checklists than noninstitutionalized children of the same age who had spent their lives in foster care. 
	- The same difference between these groups was also found  during adolescence (Goldfarb, 1943a). 
	- Even  children who were adopted from the relatively  benign orphanage environment studied by  Tizard were described by their teachers as  having more behavior problems than their  classmates at both 8 (Tizard, 1977) and 16  years old (Hodges & Tizard, 1989). 
	- Verhulst,  Althaus, and Versluis–Den Bieman (1990a,  1990b) found that 10- to 15-year-old children  who had been adopted from other countries to  the Netherlands between birth and 10 years of  age had more behavior problems than same-  age nonadopted children

- Fisher et al. (1997) found that 11 months after adoption Romanian orphanage children adopted to Canada had higher internalizing and total scores on the Child Behavior Checklist ([[CBCL]]; Achenbach, Edelbrock, & Howell, 1987) than did early-adopted or Canadian-born children. [Assessment Tools](Roll%20Ups/Assessment%20Tools.md)
	-   Children adopted after 6 months of age had higher externalizing and  total scores on the CBCL than Romanian children adopted before 6 months of age. 
	-   Although 3 years after adoption the orphanage children no longer scored higher than comparison groups on the internalizing  scale of the CBCL, they continued to score  higher on the same internalizing items on which  they had scored higher at 11 months post  adoption, that is, stares into space, strange behavior, acts too young, and speech problems.

- In the Canadian sample, researchers conducted in-depth interviews with parents regarding any behavior problems they were experiencing with their children at or soon after adoption (Fisher et al., 1997). The main areas of problematic behavior were
		-  eating
		-  stereotyped behavior
		-  peer relationships
	-   Eleven months after adoption 65% of  orphanage children had eating problems [Nutrition](Roll%20Ups/Nutrition/Nutrition.md)
		-  Parents reported that one-third of children refused to eat solid foods and almost one-third of children overate. 
		-  In the Canadian  sample, many parents of orphanage children  reported that they continued to offer food to  children after a meal and that it was never refused. [Observed behavior assessments](Observed%20behavior%20assessments.md)
		- Given orphanage children’s malnutrition and small size, such overeating probably  represents their bodies’ natural catch-up mechanism. 
		- Children in orphanage had never eaten  enough food to allow them to learn feelings  of satiety (Fisher et al., 1997). 
		-   Three  years after adoption, orphanage children had no more eating problems than did Canadian  born or early-adopted children (Ames, 1997)
	- A common behavior problem found in  most samples of orphanage children is stereotyped behavior, that is, repeating the same movement over and over, as in body rocking
		- In the Fisher et al. orphanage sample, 84% of orphanage children displayed one or more stereotyped behaviors. 
			- 67% rocked, and 19% moved their hands stereotypically [Observed behavior assessments](Observed%20behavior%20assessments.md)
			- Tizard (1977). Fisher et al. (1997) suggested that the stereotyped behavior of orphanage children may represent the prolongation of the stereotyped behaviors found in normal infants around the time they learn to sit, stand, or walk (Thelan, 1979, 1981). It may also reflect a self-soothing strategy or an attempt to self-stimulate in the barren orphan age rooms.
			-   In the Canadian sample, stereotyped be  havior was the most frequently reported be  havior problem of orphanage children but it  was also a behavior that improved quite rapidly (Fisher et al., 1997). 
			-  Young orphanage children show the same stereotyped behaviors as family-reared children just starting  to sit, stand, or walk (Thelen, 1979),  but when restriction to a crib for 18–20 hr/day does  not permit them to develop their motor skills  (Ames, 1997), these early stereotyped behaviors are practiced for a prolonged period. 
			-  In the general absence of sensory stimulation  and soothing by adults, for example, by rocking, children may learn to provide their own  stimulation or soothing by making stereo-  typed movements. 
	-   Fisher et al. (1997) found  that 32% of orphanage children had problems  with peers. 
		- The most common problems involved either avoiding contact with peers or  being overwhelmed by peers’ attention.
		-   By the time the  orphanage children had been in adopted in Canada for 8  or more years, their peer relationships had improved (Warford, 2002).
		-   On the other hand, orphanage children felt less social support from their  peer group or a close friend than did children  in the other groups. The longer children had  spent in institution, the less peer support they felt even post adoption  Peer problems are also believed to arise  from the characteristics of the orphanage environment. 
			- Young children in Romanian orphanages are generally quiet and unresponsive to each other, so after adoption they are  wary of and withdraw from family-reared chil  dren who are noisier, more active, and more  unpredictable than their peers in the orphan  age (Fisher et al., 1997). 
			- This unwillingness to interact with peers further prevents them  from learning normal patterns of social interaction. When they do become comfortable  enough to interact with peers in their new environment, they externalize (“act out”) in unacceptable ways that do not endear them to those peers. 
			- Several years after adoption, they have improved on most indices of behavior with peers but still have externalizing problems and feel less social support from peers or  close friend than family-reared children do.
-   Vorria, Rutter, Pickles, Wolkind, and Hobsbaum (1998) found that, compared to same aged peers living at home, 9- to 11-year-old  children living in a Greek orphanage were **more  inattentive and more often engaged in nonproductive activities in the classroom.** Adoptive parents highlighted the following as ongoing problems: 
	- High activity levels 
	- inability to attend
	- Distractibility / [[Attention Problems]]
	-  These findings are consistent with the earlier work of Goldfarb (1945b)  who reported distractibility and a lack of concentration among adolescents who had moved from orphanage  foster care at age 3. 
	- Chugani et al. (2001) found that ten 7- to 11-year  old children adopted from Romanian orphan ages scored on standardized tests in the mildly  impaired range on attention and in the severely impaired range on impulsivity.
	- At 3 years postadoption, orphanage children  in the Canadian sample scored higher than  comparison group children on the Attention subscale of the [[CBCL]] (Ames, 1997).  [Assessment Tools](Roll%20Ups/Assessment%20Tools.md)
		-  They were also reported by their parents according to the [[Parenting Stress Index ]](Abidin,  1990) to be more distractible but not more hyperactive on the Distractibility/Hyperactivity subscale than comparison group children at 11 months after adoption (Mainemer, Gilman, & Ames, 1998) and more distractible and hyperactive than comparison children 3 years after adoption (Ames, 1997)
		-   Kreppner, O’Connor, and Rutter  (2001) found that at both 4 and 6 years of  age the children who had been adopted from  Romania after 6 months of age were rated by  both teachers and parents on the [[Revised Rutter Parent and Teacher scales]] (Hogg, Rut  ter, & Richman, 1997) as displaying higher inattention/overactivity than did Romanian  children or U.K. children who were adopted  before 6 months of age.  
		- The Canadian adoptees from Romania continued to display more attention problems 8 or  more years after adoption (Le Mare & Audet,  2002): orphanage children scored higher than  both Canadian-born and early-adopted children  on the Attention subscale of the CBCL and  on the Impulsivity and Inhibitory Control sub  scales of the [[Children’s Behavior Questionnaire]] (Ahadi, Rothbart, & Ye, 1993) and lower  on the questionnaire’s Attention Focusing sub scale. 
		-  **29%  of children in the orphanage group had received a clinical diagnosis of attention-deficit  disorder (ADD) or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)** whereas none of the  comparison group children had received such a diagnosis (Le Mare & Audet, 2002).
		-   Marcovitch et al. 1997). In addition, Le Mare  and Audet (2002) found that children’s attentional difficulties at 8 years of age were negatively correlated with their [Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment](Home%20Observation%20for%20Measurement%20of%20the%20Environment) environment scores (Caldwell & Bradley, 1984) [Observed behavior assessments](Observed%20behavior%20assessments.md)
		- Problems in attending may be at least  partly explained by the abrupt move from the  very low levels of stimulation in the orphan  age to the overwhelming sensory stimulation  of an adoptive home without any opportunity to gradually learn how to deal with greater sensory complexity. 

-  Some behavior problems last up to 8 or more years after removal from the  institution. 
	- Fisher et al. (1997) have pointed  out that most of the characteristic early problems of children adopted from orphanages  might indicate brain damage or emotionally produced pathology if they were found in children reared in families.

# [Indiscriminate Friendliness](Indiscriminately%20Sociable%20Behavior.md)

-  Tizard (1977) characterized indiscriminate friendliness as behavior that is affectionate and friendly toward all adults (including strangers) without the fear or caution that is typical  in young children. In these cases the children’s behavior toward a stranger cannot be discriminated from their behavior toward their primary caregivers. 
-   (Hodges & Tizard, 1989). Goldfarb (1955) found that indiscriminate friendliness was still present in adolescents who had been institutionalized as children but who were later fostered to unstable foster care placements.
-   Chisholm (1998; Chisholm et al., 1995)  developed a [[5-item measure of indiscriminate  friendliness]]. [Assessment Tools](Roll%20Ups/Assessment%20Tools.md) 
	- Parents were asked five questions assessing :
		-  whether their child wandered without distress
		- whether their child was willing to go home with a stranger,
		-  how friendly their child was with new adults, 
		-  whether their child was ever shy, and 
		- what their child typically did upon meeting new adults. 

- Using a [[disinhibited attachment disturbance scale]] *[Assessment Tools](Roll%20Ups/Assessment%20Tools.md)* which contained three items similar  to those used by Chisholm (1998; Chisholm  et al., 1995), O’Connor et al. (1999) found  that approximately 20% of Romanian children  adopted between 6 and 24 months of age had high scores on the scale compared to approximately 10% of Romanian children adopted  before 6 months of age and 2% of a group of  children adopted within the United Kingdom.
- Unlike the findings for intellectual development and for other behavior problems,  there is disagreement among studies as to whether there is a relationship between the length of  time that children have spent in orphanages  (or their age at adoption) and the amount of  indiscriminate friendliness they display. 
	- O’Connor and his colleagues found modest correlations at both 4 years (O’Connor, et al., 1999) and 6 years of age (O’Connor, Rutter, et al.,  2000) between duration of deprivation (age at adoption) and children’s scores on disinhibited attachment behaviors in the U.K. group.  
	- They pointed out, however, that some children who were adopted after 2 years in Romania showed no signs of disinhibited attachment behaviors and other children who were  adopted within the first 6 months of life showed signs of the behavior 
-   In an attempt to better understand indiscriminate friendliness, **researchers have examined particular correlates that may be associated with this behavior,** focusing on aspects  of the institutional environment, child characteristics, and family characteristics.
	-  In the Canadian sample Chisholm (1998) found that  high scores on indiscriminate friendliness 3 years postadoption were positively correlated  with the child having been a favorite in the  institution. 
	- Other measures of the quality of  institutions, **were unrelated to children’s indiscriminate friendliness**. for example
		-  quality of physical care,
		-  whether toys were available (Chisholm et al. 1998)
		-  or children’s weight or developmental delay at adoption (O’Connor et al.,1999; O’Connor, Rutter, et al., 2000) 
		- [[IQ]] does not appear to be strongly related to indiscriminate friendliness
	-  Researchers have  consistently found associations between orphanage children’s indiscriminate friendliness  and their behavior problems. [Caregiving](Roll%20Ups/Caregiving/Caregiving.md)
		- Chisholm (1998)  found that at 3 years postadoption, children’s  indiscriminate friendliness scores were positively correlated with their scores on the [CBCL](CBCL). [Observed behavior assessments](Observed%20behavior%20assessments.md)
		- Le Mare and Audet (2002) found that children's scores on indiscriminate friendliness at 3 years after adoption were positively correlated with their attention problem scores more than 8 years after adoption. [Attention Problems](Attention%20Problems)
		- In the U.K. sample  children’s scores on disinhibited attachment disturbance were positively correlated with  their scores on hyperactivity and disruptive behavior measures at age 4 and hyperactivity, disruptive behavior and emotional difficulties measures at 6 years. [Observed behavior assessments](Observed%20behavior%20assessments.md)

- Unlike  many of the initial behaviors of concern in institutionalized children, displays of indiscriminate friendliness do not appear to dissipate over time but are still in evidence up to 8 years after leaving the orphanage environment (Fernyhough et al., 2002; O’Connor, Rutter,  et al., 2000) and may persist even longer (Goldfarb, 1955). 

- Chisholm (1998) has suggested that indiscriminate friendliness may serve an adaptive function in the context of the orphanage environment where emotional  resources are extremely limited. 
	- Amid the passivity of the orphanage an indiscriminately friendly child may receive what little attention caregivers have to offer. 
	- The fact that indiscriminate friendliness was associated with having been a favorite in the orphanage supports this contention but does not explain what function such behavior serves after adoption. [Observed behavior assessments](Observed%20behavior%20assessments.md)

-  O’Connor et al.  (1999) also suggested that indiscriminate friendliness may represent a form of developmental  delay in the [[attachment]] behavioral system
	-  although their use of the term “disinhibited at-  tachment disturbance” seems to suggest atten-  tion problems as well as involvement of the  attachment system.
	-   Indiscriminate friendliness is particularly  relevant to the study of attachment, given sug- gestions that this behavior may be indicative  of “nonattachment” (Lieberman & Pawl, 1988)  or the disinhibited/indiscriminate subtype of  reactive attachment disorder (Zeanah, 1996,  2000).
	- Both Lieberman and Pawl (1988) and  Zeanah (2000) described these disorders as resulting from an infant not having had the opportunity to form an attachment relationship
	-  Similarly, O’Connor et al. (2003)  reported that children in their sample who  scored high on their Disinhibited Attachment  Disturbance scale were overwhelmingly classified as Insecure/Other in terms of their attachment patterns. [disinhibited attachment disturbance scale](disinhibited%20attachment%20disturbance%20scale)
-  On the other hand, It seems unlikely that in  discriminate friendliness necessarily indicates  an attachment disorder (Chisholm, 1998) 
	-  Both Chisholm (1998) and O’Connor et al.  (2003) found some securely attached children  who are indiscriminately friendly, and Marcovitch et al. (1997) reported that some securely attached children were observed to be extremely friendly to the stranger in the Strange  Situation.
	- Indiscriminate friendliness has little or no  relation to IQ, but it is positively correlated  with behavior problems, especially problems  of attention. To some extent, therefore, it may  reflect distractibility and impulsivity as ap  lied to interactions with strange adults. 
	- This indicates a possible differentiation of two components of indiscriminate friendliness: uninhibited friendliness toward all adults and lack of  the secure base behavior characteristic of attachment. How distinguishable these two components in terms of their antecedents and consequences remains to be explored further. 


# [Attachment](attachment)

-  Given that attachment usually develops some time during the second half of the first year of life (Bowl-by, 1969/1982) children who have been housed in institutions during the first year or 2 of life necessarily develop an attachment relationship with adoptive parents later than is typical. 
-  Most researchers have assumed that the  children would have been unlikely to have de  veloped an attachment relationship with care  givers within the institution, given the very  high child to caregiver ratios within institutions (Chisholm, 1998). 
-   Tizard has been the only researcher who  examined children’s behavior toward their  caregivers within the institution context. 
	- Tizard and Tizard (1971) found that when com-  paring children in institution to family-reared  2-year-olds, a list of preferred persons could  easily be constructed for family-reared children whereas lists of preferred persons for  children from institutions included anyone  that children knew well. 
	- The only “favorite”  people in children’s lives were people they  saw rarely (i.e., a parent who visited), but  such persons were the only ones who provided one on one attention to the children. 
	- By the time the children were 8 years old there were only 7 institution children left to study and only a minority of them were suspected to have formed any attachment to their institutional caregiver. 
-   Chisholm  et al. (1995) also reported that children from  institutions did not initially display proximity  promoting behaviors like smiling, crying, and  making eye contact, behaviors that often pro  mote contact with caregivers. Parents in the  Canadian sample reported that when they first  met their children fewer than half of the children would smile back at someone who smiled at them. 
-  Conditions in CCIs and their affects on attachment 
	- Goldfarb observed a group with poor care standards while Tizard observed a group with relatively good care standards: 
		- Goldfarb  (1943a) found that the majority of 10- to 14-  year-olds who had been in orphanage for the  first 3 years of life and were later removed to  foster homes were described as withdrawn and  “removed” with both family members and their  caseworkers, and appeared unperturbed by either threats of removal from the home or  changes in foster care placements (Goldfarb,  1945b). 
		-  Goldfarb concluded that  orphanage children were unable to develop attachment relationships with their foster parents and that the effects of institutionalization were permanent. 
		- In contrast to Goldfarb’s work,  Tizard (1977) concluded that children could become attached to parents after leaving an  institution. In her sample, 20 of 25 children  were reported to have formed an attachment  relationship with their adoptive parents within  a year of leaving the institution and a majority of parents reported that their child was deeply  attached to them.
		-  Children in Goldfarb’s sample were delayed in every area of  developmnet. In contrast, children in Tizard’s  sample were chosen for good health and had  average IQs when they left the institution  (Tizard, Cooperman, Joseph, & Tizard, 1972).  These factors would bode well for the formation of an attachment relationship with parents. Second, it is unclear from Tizard’s reports whether children had truly been unable to form an initial attachment with caregivers  in the institution. 
		- Tizard and Rees (1975) reported that even though the institutions maintained a policy that discouraged caregivers from forming relationships with particular children,  there were some indications that children did  have preferences among their regular caregivers. 
		- Perhaps most important, there was a radical difference between the two studies in terms  of the stability of placement for the children  post-institutionalization. Children in Goldfarb’s  study very often went to unstable foster care  placements. By the time children were be  tween 10 and 14 years of age they had experienced care in three or four different foster homes (Goldfarb, 1943a). It is likely that having experienced a series of broken attachment  relationships contributed to children’s emotional coldness. Children in Tizard’s sample, however, went to stable adoptive homes.
	- 
-  Researchers have examined  attachment in previously institutionalized children using standard separation reunion procedures and relying on validated [[attachment coding systems]] (Chisholm, 1998; Marcovitch et al., 1997; O’Connor et al., 2003).[Assessment Tools](Roll%20Ups/Assessment%20Tools.md)
	-  In each of these studies researchers used a separation reunion procedure with preschool-aged children in which children first interacted with their mothers in play, stayed in the same room with a stranger while their mother left, and  then were reunited with their mothers. 
	-   Chisholm (1998) used [[Crittenden’s Pre school Assessment of Attachment (PAA)]]to  code preschool attachment patterns, whereas  both Marcovitch et al. (1997) and O’Connor  et al. (2003) used the [[Cassidy, Marvin, and  MacArthur Working Group Preschool  Attachment System]]. 
	-  Chisholm (1998) found that, compared to orphanage children classified as secure, those who were classified as insecure lower IQs, more behavior problems, parents who reported higher levels of parenting  stress, and lower socioeconomic status backgrounds. 
-   The distribution of atypical patterns in previously institutionalized children is not the  same as in other maltreated samples. [Observed behavior assessments](Observed%20behavior%20assessments.md)
	- One difference is that orphanage samples display a **lower percentage of the Defended/Coercive (A/C) insecure pattern** than do other maltreated  samples. 
	- A child classified as A/C shifts back and forth between defended and coercive strategies in response to the behavior of an often unpredictable caregiver.
	-   Orphanage children in the Canadian sample also displayed a higher percentage of compulsive caregiving (A3), a pattern more commonly seen in neglected samples than in abused  samples of children (Crittenden & Claussen,  2000). [Observed behavior assessments](Observed%20behavior%20assessments.md)
		-  The compulsive caregiving pattern is adopted  in response to a withdrawn or unresponsive  caregiver.
		-  A child displaying an A3 pattern inhibits negative affect and attempts to cheer  an unresponsive caregiver with overbrightness  and nurturance (Crittenden, 1992a). 
	-  Another difference is that the Insecure (other) pattern is more common in orphanage samples than in maltreated samples. **Insecure (other), by definition indicates behavior that is difficult to classify. This classification is given when a child is clearly insecure, but the  strategy that he or she uses in interaction does  not fit any of the established insecure patterns.** 
		-   Such atypicality in orphanage children’s  attachment was also apparent in the attach-  ment patterns of orphanage children classified  as secure. The PAA (Crittenden, 1992a) has a  secure classification labeled “Secure (other).”  This classification is given when children are clearly secure but the strategies they use in  interaction with their caregiver do not reflect any of the standard sub-patterns of secure. 
		-   This finding suggested the possibility that  the coding systems that were developed using  normative samples of children were inadequate to evaluate attachment in institutionalized samples, that is, that children classified  as Secure (other) might not truly be secure.  Chisholm (1996) compared Secure (other) children to both the remaining secure children and to children classified as Insecure (other) to find out which of these groups they resembled more. 
		-  Secure (other) children (from general categories) did not  differ from secure orphanage children on behavior problems, parenting stress, or indiscriminate friendliness, but they did have lower IQs than secure orphanage children. 
		-  Chisholm (1996) concluded that Secure (other) children (in CCIs) were  more similar to children classified as secure (in general categories) than to children classified as Insecure (other).  This suggests that the PAA is able to classify children appropriately as secure and insecure, **and yet reveals that orphanage children may display even secure patterns of attachment differently from both normal samples and noninstitutional, high-risk samples of children.** 
-  Tizard and Hodges (1978) did not find a relationship between whether a parent  considered his or her child to be attached at 8  years of age and the length of time the child  had spent in institution: 
	- The majority of children who had spent at least 4.5 years in institution were reported to be closely attached to  their parent at 8 years of age
	-  In a reanalysis of the Chisholm  (1998) data, Ames and Chisholm (2001) found  that the median and ranges of length of institutionalization were 
		- 16.5 (range = 9–39 months)  for orphanage children subsequently classified  as secure; 
		- 14 (range = 9–53) months for chil  dren classified as typical insecure;
		-  and 21  (range = 8–53) months for children classified as atypical insecure.
	- These differences were  not statistically significant, but it is important  to note that the oldest children who had developed a secure attachment relationship with an adoptive parent had spent only 39 months in an orphanage.
	-  In this sample there were  only 5 children who had spent more than 39  months in an orphanage. All of those children developed an insecure attachment relationship.
	- It is clear that on the basis of 5 children, no firm conclusions can be drawn concerning the end of a sensitive period for the development of a first attachment. 
-  It remains unclear whether **there is a length of time beyond which developing a secure attachment relationship may become impossible.** 
	- Bowlby initially claimed that if the opportunity to form an attachment was delayed until after the age  of 2.5 years, it was “almost useless” (Bowlby,  1953), thereby implying a short window of  opportunity for developing attachment. 
	-  By  1973, he claimed that the sensitive period for  attachment likely extended through the de  cade beyond a child’s fifth birthday, but that  such development would become increasingly  more difficult as a child grew older. This was  in line with a more modern emphasis on risk  and resilience in a probabilistic, rather than  deterministic, model of development (Rutter  & O’Connor, 1999).

## Sensitive Responsiveness and attachment
[Caregiving](Roll%20Ups/Caregiving/Caregiving.md)

- Children with lower IQs (Chisholm  1998; Tizard & Hodges, 1978) and more behavior problems (Chisholm, 1998; Marcovitc  et al., 1997) have more difficulty forming attachment relationships with their adoptive parents, most likely because these factors interfere with parents’ ability to be sensitively responsive to their children.
-  These factors may help to explain the insecure attachments of the oldest five children in  the Ames and Chisholm (2001) reanalysis. 
	- All  five of these children had IQ scores lower  than 85, and four of the five came from families whose income was lower than the average  for the orphanage group as a whole. 
	- Three of these children scored above the clinical cutoff on behavior problems, and
	-  three of the four for whom parenting stress scores were available had higher than average parenting stress scores for the orphanage group.
- Therefore, **rather than assume that length of institutionalization per se explains their lack of secure attachment, it appears more reasonable to suggest that they were adopted into families in  which the resources were not sufficient to allow parents to provide children who had many problems with the high level of sensitive responsiveness that would be required to develop a secure attachment.**
- [Restoration](Roll%20Ups/Alternative%20Care/Restoration.md)  Between 2 and 4 years of age, 24 of the children were adopted out of institution and 15  children were restored to their natural families. In comparing the adoptive and restored  groups of children
	- Tizard and Hodges (1978)  found that whereas 84% of adoptive mothers  felt that their child was deeply attached to  them, only 54% of mothers of restored chil  dren felt this was the case. Children in the restored group were reunited with their bio  logical mothers who often were ambivalent or reluctant to have their child return home.
		-  Restored children typically were returned to  families who had a larger number of children  (Tizard & Hodges, 1978), whose mothers were  younger and whose fathers had jobs of a lower socioeconomic status (Tizard & Rees,  1974). 
		- Parents of restored children also spent  lesstime in play and educational activities with their children than parents in the adoptive group (Hodges & Tizard, 1989). 
	- **Tizard and Hodges (1978) concluded that forming a secure attachment relationship did not so much depend on institutionalization as on the "willingness of the new parents to accept a dependent relationship and to put a lot time and effort into developing it"**
-  **We do not yet know whether the period during which attachment is possible might be extended through adolescence,** as Bowlby (1988) has suggested, or whether there is an earlier time after which  the development of attachment becomes impossible.  

# Conclusions
- **Research on institutionalized children has  shown that similar experiences early in life may  result in a variety of outcomes, a phenomenon  that Cicchetti (1996) has termed [[multifinality]].**
- Given the profound general deprivation that  often characterizes orphanages, **researchers  have been unable to specify which aspects of  deprivation caused the outcomes that have  been found.** 
	- The only exception is Tizard’s work (1977) with orphanage children in the  United Kingdom, who experienced only social emotional deprivation but were well cared  for otherwise. 
		- We know from this work that  providing good nutrition and cognitive stimulation can prevent developmental delays. 
		- These same children, however, still displayed  indiscriminate friendliness and some difficulties in attachment, which seem attributable to  the limitation of not having had a close personal relationship with an adult caregiver.
-  There are presently (at time of writing) two intervention studies ongoing in Eastern Europe. 
	- [[The Bucharest Early Intervention Project]] (Koga,  Smyke, Zeanah, 2003; Zeanah, Smyke, & Koga,  2003) has begun providing a foster care inter-  vention in Bucharest, Romania, in which they  are following the development of children re-  moved from orphanage to foster care and com-  paring their developmental progress to both  children who remain in orphanage and a com-  munity comparison group. 
	- [[The St. Petersburg– U.S.A. Orphanage Project]] (McCall, Muha-  medrahimov, Groark, Palmov, & Nikiforova,  2003), operating in three baby homes in St. Petersburg, is providing different interventions to examine which are most effective in reducing the developmental impact of institutional rearing. I
		- In one baby home, orphanage staff are being trained in child development  and sensitive responsiveness. 
		- In a second,  both caregiver training and structural changes  that reduce the number of different caregivers  and increase their stability in the lives of the children are being implemented. 
		- A third baby  home is serving as a “no intervention” comparison group
- A potential solution to high caregiver ratios is to ensure children are not in age segregated groups: 
	-  Children in Eastern European orphanages are typically housed in age segregated groups, a policy that hinders cognitive growth.
