# CCI Operations
- certain modal features of institutional care that have characterized settings across countries and continents:
	- generally high child to caregiver ratios; 
	- caregiverswith low wages and little education or training who work rotating shifts; 
	- regimented and non-individualized care;
	-  and a lack of psychological investment in the children (Chapin,1915; The St. Petersburg-USA Orphanage Research Team, 2008; Zeanah et al., 2003). (Page 3)

# Physical Health

- Relative to their peers, they show atypically short height, low weight, and small head circumference (Page 6) [[Roll Ups/Physical Health/Physical Health]] [Nutrition](Roll%20Ups/Nutrition/Nutrition.md)

# Mental Health
 ## [Indiscriminately Sociable Behavior](Roll%20Ups/Child%20Development/Indiscriminately%20Sociable%20Behavior.md) : 
- Indiscriminately sociable behavior refers to children’s lack of reticence with unfamiliar adults, willingness to approach and engage strangers, and failure to maintain proximity to attachment figures in unfamiliar settings. 
- Bowlby (1969/1982), the architect of attachment theory, proposed that human infants, like the young of many other species, have a need to form attachments to primary caregivers. The attachment system serves to enhance the child’s likelihood of survival (andthus survival of the genes) because the infant seeks to maintain proximity to the caregiver under conditions of threat. (Page 3)
-  O’Connor and colleagues (O’Connor et al., 2000;O’Connor & Zeanah, 2003) have emphasized the lack of social boundaries among children with this behavior pattern. Zeanah et al. (2005) found that 44% of institutionalized children showed high levels of indiscriminately sociable behavior as contrasted with 18% of children who had never been institutionalized. (Page 6)
- Interventions for post-institutionalized children that have gained considerable attention among adoptive parents and clinicians are sometimes called “attachment therapy” (Cline, 1992; Keck & Kupecky, 1995) or “holding therapy.”
	- Many of these interventions use coercive techniques, such as rage induction or forced holding.
	-  A number of researchers have called such therapies into question (e.g., Chaffin etal., 2006; Lilienfield, 2007; Pignotti & Mercer, 2007), suggesting that the treatment may actually be harmful to children and families. In fact, at least six children have died fromcoercive holding therapies (Chaffin et al., 2006). This illustrates the urgency of developingevidence-based practice for this population. (Page 9)
- the experience of visiting institutions is likely to be powerful for many donors because institutionalized children, often displaying signs of indiscriminately sociability, make visitors feel valued and needed.  (Page 12)
- An education effort should target helping donors and volunteers develop a sophisticated understanding of institutional care and its effects,  (Page 12)
## Cognitive Functioning
-  To assess cognitive functioning at the level of differential brain activation, Marshall, Fox,and the BEIP Core Group (2004) examined differences in alpha and theta power throughelectroencephalogram (EEG) data among institutionalized and never institutionalized children. 
-  Institutionalized children showed lower alpha power at prefrontal cortex sites, and higher theta power at posterior sites, relative to never institutionalized children. 
-  This pattern of results is suggestive of either cortical hypoactivation or delayed cortical maturation, thatis, either deviant or delayed development (Marshall et al., 2004; McLaughlin et al., 2010).
- The specific deficits in attention and executive functioning that have been seen amongchildren who have been institutionalized are consistent with these EEG results (Gunnar,Bruce, & Grotevant, 2000; Gunnar et al., 2007; Kreppner et al., 2007). (Page 7)
## Cortisol Production
- Results from studies of cortisol production among children in institutional settings are somewhat complex (e.g., Gunnar, Frenn, Wewerka, & van Ryzin, 2009).
- Gunnar et al.(2001) found elevated basal levels of cortisol among postinstitutionalized children relative tocontrols.
- Wismer Fries, Shirtcliff, and Pollak (2009) found that postinstitutionalized childrenshowed slower recovery of the HPA system under some conditions. 
- Extrapolating from theliterature on adversity more generally (e.g., Bruce, Fisher, Pears, & Levine, 2009; Dozier etal., 2006; Fisher, van Ryzin, & Gunnar, in press; Gunnar & Vazquez, 2001), it seems likelythat the functioning of the HPA system is affected by institutional care. (Page 8)


## Successful Interventions : [[Attachment and Bio-Behavioral Catchup Approach (ABC)]]
- The ABC intervention targets regulatory issues, attachment quality, and indiscriminatesociability. 
- The original ABC intervention model had been shown to be effective with high-risk birth children and with foster children (Bernard et al., in press; Dozier et al., 2006). 
- The adapted intervention is currently being tested in a randomized clinical trial with internationally adopted children. 
- Three issues targeted in the intervention are described below:
	- The first component of ABC targets children’s self-regulatory capabilities by helping parents to learn to behave in synchronous ways with their children. 
		- This component is adapted from interventions that have targeted the importance of interactional synchrony in enhancing regulatory capabilities among infants(Calkins, 2011). 
		- Shonkoff and colleagues (Shonkoff & Bales, 2011; Shonkoff,Boyce, & McEwen, 2009) have suggested that such interactions be referred to as“serve and return” in that the caring adult “returns” the child’s “serve.” For example, when a child bangs two blocks together, the parent is urged to follow along (e.g., banging two blocks together herself or commenting on what the child is doing) rather than to direct the play (e.g., suggest that the child build a tower orcomment on the color or shape of the blocks).
		- Children who have been institutionalized are often dysregulated biologically (e.g.,as seen in HPA axis functioning), and behaviorally (e.g., as seen in problems in sustained attention). It is expected that this intervention component will enhance children’s cortisol regulation, attention, and behavioral control. 
		- In randomized clinical trials with foster and high-risk children living with their birth parents, the intervention has been found to enhance cortisol regulation and behavioral outcomes(Dozier et al., 2006; Dozier et al., 2009; Dozier, Peloso, Lewis, Laurenceau, &Levine, 2008). (Page 11).
- In the intervention, adoptive parents are helped to reinterpret their children’s behavioral signals, providing nurturance even when it is not elicited. 
	- This intervention component is expected to enhance parental nurturance, and to enhance children’s attachment quality. 
	- Stovall and Dozier (Stovall & Dozier, 2000;Stovall-McClough & Dozier, 2004) found that children who experienced early adversity often behave in avoidant or resistant ways (e.g., turning away from caregivers when distressed), eliciting complementary behaviors from their parents

-  The final issue addressed by the ABC intervention is indiscriminately sociable behaviors.
	-  These behaviors are targeted by helping adoptive parents recognize thesigns of indiscriminate sociability and develop strategies for discouraging thebehavior.
	-  Decreased indiscriminate sociability is expected as a result of this intervention component. 
	- We do not yet have data that suggest whether we will be successful in affecting this behavior because we have not targeted this behavior in other interventions. (Page 11)

- In our randomized clinical trial with high-risk birthparents, only 32% of the children whose parents received the ABC intervention showed disorganized attachments, as contrasted with 57% of the children whose parents received the control intervention (Bernard et al., 2011). (Page 11)
