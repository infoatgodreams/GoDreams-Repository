# Scope: 

- We searched four databases (Pubmed/Medline, CINHAL Plus, Embase and Global Health Database) for relevant articles published from January 1990 to January 2019.
- Studies that included information on anthropometry or micronutrient status of children living within institutionalized care were eligible for inclusion. 	
- From 3,602 titles screened, we reviewed 98 full texts, of which 25 papers were eligible. Two (8%) studies reported data from multiple countries, nine (36%) were from Asia, four (16%) from Africa, three (12%) from Eastern Europe, four (16%) from the European Union and one (4%) from each of the remaining regions (Middle East, South America and the Caribbean). Twenty-two (88%) were cross sectional. Ten (40%) of the studies focused on children >5 years, seven (28%) on children <5 years, seven (28%) covered a wide age range and one did not include ages. Low birth weight prevalence ranged from 25–39%. Only five (20%) included information on children with disabilities and reported prevalence from 8–75%

# Summary of Results
[[Nutrition]]
- Prevalence of under nutrition varied between ages,sites and countries:
	- stunting ranged from 9–72%;
	- wasting from 0–27%; 
	- under-weight from 7–79%;
	- low BMI from 5–27%.
	- Overweight/obesity ranged from 10–32%
	- small head circumference from 17–41%.
	- The prevalence of HIV was from 2–23%
	- Anemia from 3 – 90%.
	- Skin conditions or infections ranged from 10–31%
	- Parasitesfrom6–76%
	- Half the studies with dietary information found inadequate intake or diet diversity. Younger children were typically more malnourished than older children, with a few exceptions (Page 1)

- Children in institutional care often face numerous adversities prior to admission and many enter institutionalized care with pre-existing nutritional, developmental, medical and neurological conditions(Baron,Baron&Spencer,2001; The Children’s Health Care Collaborative Study Group,1994; The St. Petersburg-USA Orphanage ResearchTeam,2005; The St. Petersburg-USA Orphanage ResearchTeam,2008). (Page 3)
- Born prematurely or with low birth weight and many have had exposure to drugs or alcohol, HIV, stress or a range of other issues —all of which can impact their health.(Baron,Baron&Spencer,2001; Groceetal.,2014; The Children’s Health Care Collaborative Study Group,1994; The St. Petersburg-USA Orphanage Research Team,2008) (Page 3)
- No information about children’s early lives or exposures prior to coming into care(The Children’s Health Care Collaborative Study Group,1994; The St Petersburg-USA Orphanage Research Team,2005; The St.Petersburg-USA Orphanage Research Team,2008). (Page 3)
	

## [Physical Health](Roll%20Ups/Physical%20Health/Physical%20Health.md)
- Common illnesses observed were (Page 11)
	- children having three or more parasites
	- skin infections
	- varicellazoster
	- tuberculosis
	- impetigo
	- dentalissues
	- ear/nose/throat problems
	- respiratory infections
	- diarrhoea
- 10-31% of children had skin conditions or infections
- 75% of children had an infection within the first three months of admission to a site(Kapavarapuetal.,2012)
- Anemia prevelance ranged from 3-90%
- 33% of children had low vitamin D
- Common deficiencies were iodine, zinc, albumin , vitamin A and B
- Edema, Conjunctival pallor, xerophthalmia and goiter were also found

# [Nutrition](Roll%20Ups/Nutrition/Nutrition.md)

- Mwaniki and colleagues found that diet diversity was lower in children. Diets were reported to have high reliance on starches and legumes (Mwaniki,Makokha&Muttunga,2014). (Page 11)
- Hearstetal.(2014)concluded that the growth-related indicators coincide with the high prevalence of low albumin, indicating generalized chronic undernutrition, and suggested macronutrient deficiencies could be due to 
	- inadequate diets,
	- infections and/ or inflammation,
	-  impaired nutrient absorption or utilization
	-  psychosocial stress of living in an institution. (Page 30)
- Dietary diversity was reported to be low for children in institutional care , especially in terms of
	- fruits
	- vegetables
	- protein
- Limited funding and reliance on donations for food were frequently mentioned issues, and resulted in diets high in starches and legumes (Mwaniki,Makokha&Muttunga,2014). (Page 30)
- Factors impacting children’s nutrition status in care centers include 
	- Inadequate or poor quality of food
	- inappropriate types of food
	- inadequate stimulation or attention
	- improper use of medications
	- inappropriate feeding practices
	- poor hygiene and sanitation leading to frequent illness and poor utilization of nutrients
