# Introduction to the Domain

For children in need of care and protection, education is not only a tool to support learning, but it is crucial to leverage significant improvements in their lives. Besides equipping children with key technical skills, academic training, and life skills, schooling will contribute to a child’s holistic development and serve as a safe, structured environment in particularly difficult times of change.  A child who knows how to read, write, do basic arithmetic and develop life skills has a solid foundation for continued learning throughout life. For children in institutions, it is known that school attendance plays a role in helping children with a background of trauma to regain a sense of normalcy and aids in building psychosocial resilience to changes that disrupt their lives. 

It has been established that education allows vulnerable children to participate in the economy, improves their health outcomes, and instills a sense of purpose in children lacking direction. Children who lack access to quality education are disadvantaged in terms of income, health, and opportunity. Education is a primary driver of growth and development in children.  

Children leaving care settings are disadvantaged five-fold, according to leading research from the UK

- Firstly, children from institutions are at a higher risk of poor grades in primary school because of primary gaps in numeracy and literacy.
- Secondly, children in institutions often receive lower grades than their peers with the same cognitive capacity, reflecting gaps in how education reaches them in traditional schools.
- Thirdly, children in institutions attain lower educational outcomes relative to peers with similar academic potential, suggesting gaps in children continuing their education in institutions.
- Fourthly, children in institutions often ended-up with lower education levels than children with the same average grades from primary school.
- Fifthly, in institutional care, children have a lower chance of achieving a secondary education when grades were poor, relative to peers in familial settings.

  
It is clear that additional emphasis on educational outcomes is not only recommended but is necessary for institutional care to serve its basic purpose of preparing children for a better future.


## Overview of Education in Child Care Institutions

Children in need of care and protection often come in with significant learning lags, having experienced several school changes, significant time spent out of school, and a lack of support to bridge gaps. Institutions typically choose schools based on affordability, and learning facilities at the children’s home are built around the school programming.

Children in care and care leavers are particularly affected by their experiences of trauma through loss, neglect, and abuse. These experiences can impact their health, well-being, and ability to engage in learning so they often tend to have poorer academic outcomes. According to a report that looks at child performance in five different sites in developing countries, we know that being a child in need of care and protection in a low-to-middle income country can often mean fewer years of schooling, poorer school performance, poorer households, less adequate housing, and increased malnutrition.  Knowing that children who come into institutions are prone to these factors, providing methods to compensate for learning losses is critical.

From observational insights and existing literature, the following are a few factors that influence the quality of educational outcomes in institutional care:

Existing research has indicated that caregiving staff at institutions are not adequately qualified to identify gaps in children’s academic performance and offer them additional academic support outside of school. The addition of qualified tution teachers to compensate for this is limited by availability and funds.

- A major roadblock to education of children in institutions is the lack of support to bridge existing gaps in children’s learning levels when they enter.  Many children, before they enter care, lag behind their peers because of their  disruptive and disadvantaged  backgrounds. 
- There have been many reports that detail how children in school are stigmatised based on their institutional background which impedes their academic progress. Children often experience different forms of stigma, discrimination, and social exclusion.
- School disruption: Research has shown that multiple school changes in irregular intervals are an issue for children because it disrupts relationships with their peers and teachers. This disruption negatively impacts both their experience and engagement with school. 
- Managing transitions: The research suggests there are issues at each level of educational transitions, from primary to secondary schooling, moving to high school, and finally leaving institutional care. At each step of the way, the risk of dropping out increases. 
- Gendered expectations: The challenges that children face in attaining excellent educational outcomes are different, based on social determinants, including gender. Boys are under more career pressure and are pushed towards the first forms of paid work they can access. For girls, the reasons for dropping out might include marriage, caretaking of younger siblings or ailing parents,  among others.

  
## Stakeholders

In an institution, the primary stakeholders responsible for educational outcomes of children are teachers at school, the leadership and school management, tuition teachers, caregivers, counsellors, and other children at school. 

- **Teachers** at school play an important role in the learning outcomes of children in care. It’s noteworthy to mention that teachers often tend to be the only other regular adult interaction that children in institutions have, outside of existing staff. They need to be sensitive to the trauma that children come with, understand existing biases and stigma, and work to ensure that children in care are treated with respect and dignity in every school setting. 
- The **leadership** and school management are also key stakeholders because they often report back to the staff at institutions and take key decisions regarding the child’s educational trajectory, and address any behavioural concerns. Often, it is the leadership at school that sets the tone for customised learning experiences and approach to children from residential care settings at the school. They also act as key stakeholders involved in admitting children to school, providing concessions of fees and joining conditions. 
- After-school **tuition teachers** at the CCI are important stakeholders primarily because children enter CCIs with many gaps in learning. This means that bridge programs and after-school coaching support are crucial to achieving optimal learning outcomes. This is even more so because, it falls within the direct influence of CCI authorities who are fully aware and able to customise keeping in mind the children’s individual circumstances 
- **House parents** are the first point of contact for the teachers at school to understand and make sense of the behaviour and performance of children in school. House parents provide context to the day-to-day behaviour and routines of children which can influence the individual educational plan. They can also implement changes recommended by the teaching staff. 
- **Counsellors** are regularly engaged to prepare children for school, new environments, new peers, and different authority figures. They can also help children adjust to difficult situations at school, and offer suggestions to deal with interpersonal conflicts with peers at school. 
- **Children at school**, who do not come from an institutional background also need to be aware of, and respectful of the background of children in care. They need to be trained by their parents and teachers on appropriate language and inclusivity in all their activities. They can make or break the experience of institutionalised children in school

  
# Educational Outcomes


## Optimal Adult Outcomes
_These outcome indicators typically describe the long-term success seen in the educational status of care-leavers_

- Care leavers are able to complete graduate education and get placed at a job proportionate with their education.
- Care leavers are able to maintain and grow careers in chosen fields.
- Care leavers are able to leverage their skills to be financially independent and secure.
- Care leavers are able to integrate into academic or job environments.
- Care leavers are on par with their peers in English fluency, soft skills and technical skills in chosen subject areas.
- Skill level, aptitude and interest become important driving factors of career choice, being balanced with financial constraints. 
- Care leavers can point out mentors who are deeply invested in their academic journey and career advancement. 
- Care leavers are on par with their peers in habits and mindsets associated with maintaining and growing their careers.
- Care leavers adopt a positive attitude towards learning and academic accomplishment, and see it as an asset to support their long term careers.


## Current Reality

### From Literature

We know that breakdown of the continuum of care, residential instability, inability to form long-term peer groups and frequent changes in the environment – all contribute towards an inability to acquire proper skills and poor academic performance. Many young adults choose not to pursue higher education and are forced to join the workforce due to financial constraints.

In more detail, 

- **Low continuity in education:** Care leavers from India reported that they were unable to continue their education according to their wishes during their time at the institution. This percentage rose when we looked at care leavers who were forced to quit their formal education during the aftercare period, against their original wishes.
- **Gendered differences in outcomes:** The proportion of female care leavers reporting the inability to continue their education almost doubled during the transition from the time at the institution to the aftercare period.
- **Lack of employable skill development:** According to a study by Udayan care, large number of care leavers in India have self-reported that they are not satisfied with their skill development. Studies also show that a very small percentage of care leavers build adequate career-related skills in institutions.
- **Little to no financial literacy:** A majority of care leavers reported getting no guidance regarding their money management during their childhood. At institutions, they did not receive any training on household money management, including the value of savings, and methods of properly maintaining their income and expenses.


## From the Field

- Financing for graduate education is difficult and scholarships are in short supply.
- Learning lags continue to follow children as they enter the workforce, with children often finding themselves behind their peers at work in terms of hard skills and soft skills. 
- Care leavers struggle to cope with external pressures and new environments outside the safety of the institution, and hence even academically gifted students face difficulties in college.
- Resource constraints are the key driver in decision making of career paths.
- Due to lack of exposure, care leavers don’t access the diverse options available and orient towards careers that they have seen around them growing up or heard of through unplanned exposure. 
- Care leavers struggle with consistency in performance outside of rigid routines at the institution. 
- Care leavers are often needed to take care of household responsibilities or are asked to get married to ease the burden of their families as soon as they leave the institution, affecting their uptake of careers or education. 
- Existing schemes for education and skilling of youth are under-utilized for care leavers due to a lack of awareness amongst youth.


# Educational Indicators and Inputs

## Optimal Childhood Indicators
_These social impact indicators allow us to evaluate the positive educational status of children in CCIs_

- All children must be in school in the appropriate class for their age with high continuity and attendance.
- Children with learning disabilities should be regularly accessing specialised education services. 
- Children are able to articulate a positive attitude towards education & school.
- Children are able to self-regulate behavior and attention during classes. 
- Children have clear academic goals.
- Children are able to engage with and learn from material that is age appropriate.
- Children are able to learn independently and in groups.
- Children proactively learn from adults around them including teachers, volunteers, visitors, caregivers etc.
- Children have average to above average scores at school.
- As children reach middle and high school, they are able to articulate career goals.
- Children have grade level literacy and numeracy levels. 
- Children are able to integrate into the school environment.

  
## Current Reality

### From Literature
Research shows major gaps in the learning indicators of children in institutions
- While most school-aged children in need of care and protection were currently attending school, many had not achieved the educational milestones expected for their age. 
- Despite consistently higher primary school and partial secondary school completion, children from CCIs were less likely to fully complete secondary school.
- Children in CCIs show a marked rise in emotional difficulties that are correlated with lags in cognitive development.
- Children feeling ‘different’ or not included in school due to various factors such as lack of sensitization, differences in personal hygiene/clothing at the CCI, physical health status etc.
- Low self-esteem among children from institutional care was found to be a contributing factor to poor performance in education.
- Reading and writing were other challenges that Children in CCIs struggled with. A large percentage of children in institutional care reported not being able to read or write like their peers in school; clear outputs of lagging educational outcomes. 
- Children in institutions demonstrated several academic risks, which was partly caused by multiple disruptions in schooling due to changes in placements.

## From the Field

- Depending on the institutions, children are often either over or under-diagnosed with learning difficulties and attention related disorders leading to inappropriate allocation of limited differentiated support resources.
- During after-school homework time, students typically do minimum required work, and often copy from peers or textbooks verbatim. This is exacerbated by the fact that often times the caregivers monitoring classes aren’t english literate themselves and cannot check the quality of the work.
- Many children, even those in primary school, articulate a lack of interest in academics more acutely than their peers at a similar age group.
- We observed that many children in high school were unable to read words and sentences in English from their textbooks,making it difficult to clear high school examinations and later graduate to college-level education. 
- Low levels of english fluency can also be attributed to CCIs selection of vernacular medium schools due to resource constraints. 
- Focus of after-school classes is often memorization and exam preparation, with bridge programs and concept based lessons only happening in rare cases.
- Children are often multiple years behind grade level in foundational literacy and numeracy skills by the time they reach middle school.
- While some children have a degree of writing and reading ability in English, verbal fluency often lags behind due to a lack of opportunity to practice and exposure.


# Suggested Childhood Inputs
_You can find the official recommendations for education from the Juvenile Justice Act attached in the annexure of this document_

- Key adults who provide guidance and encouragement: A common theme among the research conducted on educational inputs that work suggests that a good relationship with at least one supportive adult is critical. stress the importance of a good relationship with at least one supportive adult. Other themes emerging included mentor relationships being the most significant influence in career development for young people.
- Financial support for all programs of interest for the children, including specialised coaching and additional mentoring services, if needed.
- Institutions need to hire qualified coaching teachers who provided critical education support to children after school hours.
- Institutions should implement an activity-based teaching and learning method, story pedagogy, effective lesson planning, and classroom management to capture and retain the interest of children.
- Children in middle school should be provided aptitude testing and career counselling services, to slowly prepare for their careers post-high-school. 
- Children’s participation should be encouraged through children’s committees on topics like co-curricular, extra curricular activities, academic interest groups etc.
- Teachers at school, volunteers and other external adults working with children in this domain needs to be trained and sensitised to the ongoing impacts of trauma, exclusion and factors that affect academic outcomes in children from Children’s Homes.
- Support and communities of practice need to be built among tution staff at CCIs towards being able to adapt and evolve educational practices in response to student needs or developments in the education space.
- Bridge programs are crucial at the admission stage and need based throughout the stay at the children’s home to ensure learning lags are compensated for. 
- Frequent benchmark assessments of learning levels outside of school assessments need to be conducted, so that teachers can provide support based on individual learning needs.
- Sufficient capacity for differentiation has to be built to ensure children can learn in diverse ways based on interest and need.
- Learning environments including libraries, digital resources need to be updated frequently and well stocked. Children need to be given access to these frequently with the appropriate monitoring. 
- Common study spaces should ideally provide sufficient noise isolation and easy access to these resources. Study areas can be separated if feasible for children in high school or college.
- While 1 on 1 or small group support is crucial for good academic outcomes, children also need to be supported to participate actively in larger group instruction that will commonly pervade their school or college lives. 
- Multiple opportunities to pursue academic areas of interest need to be created for individual children, including seeking out and securing opportunities for specific learning goals. 
- Children’s participation in external academic activities such as olympiads, coaching centers and other structures as per need should be facilitated.
- Conversations around academic and career goals need to be frequent, even more so from middle school onwards

  
## Current Reality 

### From Literature

- Children’s learning lags when coming into institutions and lack of support for staff to help children improve, leads to a cycle of low expectations for academic potential and career aspirations. 
- Children in care are rarely consulted or given opportunities to communicate their views on decisions. Without their participation, the young people end up in courses that they have little interest in or ability to pursue, leading to many dropping out or struggling to attain good qualifications.
- In addition, a growing phenomenon in Africa and Asia is orphanage tourism, where tourists and volunteers are allowed to visit and stay in care facilities for a fee or donation. However, some activities of the visitors disrupt the children’s education. For instance, the children sometimes miss school to rehearse and undertake performances to entertain donors visiting the residential facility.
- An interesting finding from the research is that for some young people, the extremely high expectations of the staff members also had a negative influence on their education because the unrealistic expectations of adults put undue pressure on young people. This contributed to them experiencing low self-esteem and eventual disengagement from school.
- In a few cases, negative comments from teachers and schoolmates because of their care background made school difficult for many of the young people in the study. These experiences of stigma resulted in some even dropping out, disrupting their education.
- An Individual Education Plan is necessary for each child in an institution to receive customized support and to track progress regularly.
- Grades, satisfaction with schooling, and general perception of children about learning and school are only monitored at a group level. Individual context is typically lacking.
- There is an inadequacy of books and reference material at institutions, with many CCIs relying on donated materials. 
- Alternative modes of learning outside of textbook based are rarely available.


## From the Field

- Infrastructure and facilities don’t always support ideal learning environments for children- Study room facilities can be inadequate and children are often required to find places to study without any tables or seating arrangements. 
- Children receive varied educational inputs based on whether they go sent to government or private schools; a majority of institutions send their children to government schools or low-income private schools due to resource constraints.
- Children within the same home may sometimes receive unequal access to quality education depending on their education being sponsored by donors. 
- Education sponsorship is a common tool used to engage donors; donors expect children to keep in touch with them through letters, calls, or visits. 
- Lack of afterschool support, mainly driven by a lack of availability of qualified tutors at the home is observed in some institutions. This is more commonly observed for subjects of mathematics and sciences in high school, that require more qualified tutors.
- Study time is often supervised by a house parent who is not always trained to teach children or support them with their homework, and sometimes cannot read or write in the language of instruction but are able to judge based on volume of home-work completed and diary notes from school teachers.
- Children with learning disorders or attention issues are often neglected due to lack of bandwidth or lack of expertise. Behavioural concerns in school or during study time are not always directly reported to counsellors and teachers sometimes struggle to identify non-violent methods of disciplining children. 
- Some children pursue NIOS curriculum, but the majority of children in CCIs from Bangalore, Chennai and Cochin are state board students followed by CBSE, based on trends observed in scholarship applications.
- Individual education plans are not commonly used in practice and remain documentation tools.

  

# Key Excerpts from Research


## From Literature

**Disruption in learning:** Children growing up in the same institution for many years had better attendance markers than their vulnerable peers from family care, but this changes for worse if the child is moved around to different institutions. (Frimpong-Manso, 2021)
**Poor educational attainment:** Studies in Australia by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) have indicated that children in care have lower reading and numeracy test scores than their peers (Australian Institute of Health & Welfare, 2015)
**Turbulent early years:** Children in need of care and protection often experience difficult early childhoods, leading to lags in language and communication that can be difficult to bridge when they are in schools. (Babchishin, 2015).

  

**Comparison to Boarding schools:** Data from boarding schools suggest that academic outcomes need not be determined only by group residential care. After controlling for background and personality attributes, this study found predominant parity between boarding and day students in their motivation, engagement, and achievement levels. (Martin, 2021)

  

**Difficulty in identifying high school educators:** High school educators need to be qualified, and CCIs are unable to get them on board due to high costs. (Darkwah, 2016)

  

**Impact of social deprivation and trauma:** Many children have experienced significant trauma, and this can have a long-term impact on educational engagement and outcomes. (Lund, 2020)

  

**Caregiver Education:** Caregivers with higher levels of education are more likely to take decisions that support school enrollment and retain children in school, despite monetary constraints. (Sinha, 2016) 

  

**Gender bias:** In India, female children continue to be one of the most disadvantaged groups that are systematically left out of school due to fiscal constraints, safety, and perceived economic returns, among other socially driven reasons. (OECD, 2012)

**From the Field**

  

**Lack of learning materials:** Libraries are , often filled with donated books that are not necessarily age-appropriate or relevant to their educational status.

  

**Covid-19 Learning Losses:** The closing down of schools during pandemic restrictions has resulted in children in CCIs developing significant learning lags. Many children were sent home, with difficulty in accessing online classes. At CCIs, sufficiency of devices for the large numbers was a key challenge. 

  

**Inequity of educational inputs within CCIs:** Children in institutions are often sent to low-income private schools or government schools, a decision that largely hinges on funding availability. We also observed that children are sent to different schools based on their fees being sponsored, creating inequity in outcomes within the institution. Schooling options also tend to be an important factor in decisions on locations that CCIs prefer to rent out for the home.

  

**Conducive Learning Environments:** For children in institutions, dedicated and well designed learning spaces are lacking.. The dormitory, dining area or corridors often double up as study areas. Tables and study facilities are rare and often not appropriate for age, with older children having to sit on small desks etc. Semi-private study spaces are very rare.

**After-school programs exist in most institutions:** Though in most institutions, there is a severe lack of trained teachers and no qualified in-house education coordinator, house parents play a monitoring role vs educating role during study sessions, and younger children often rely on older children for support where available.

  

**Expectations around education:** Education focussed inputs such as study time, routines etc are present in most institutions.  Caregivers and CCI staff often articulate aspirations for educational outcomes of children.  although expectations on education can vary from case to case based on factors such as the CCI staff’s own education levels, funding for school fees, gender biases etc. This is a domain that CCIs typically articulate an interest to invest more in if funding were available.

  

**Co-curricular activities and exposure:** Due to logistical constraints, difficulty obtaining permissions, limited staff availability and security challenges, there is a hesitation to allow children to participate in external competitions, olympiads and activities.  The institutions that were willing to assume the risk, with necessary precautions, were ones where there was a strong capacity to handle legal, compliance and liability issues.
