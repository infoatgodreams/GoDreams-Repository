**Introduction to the Domain**

Nutrition is a vital component of childcare that has far-reaching consequences across outcomes in physical health, mental health, education and overall quality of life.  We know that there are far-reaching consequences to malnutrition, including Malnutrition leads to failure in early physical growth, delayed motor skills, and cognitive and behavioral development. (Galler, 2021)

Under-nutrition diminishes immunity and increases morbidity and mortality. Children who survive malnutrition in early childhood have physical and cognitive disadvantages compared to those who have had adequate nutritional inputs. Multiple studies show that nutrition in a child’s early years is linked to their health and academic performance in later years. (Nyaradi, 2013) 

**Overview of Nutrition in Child Care Institutions:**

  
It is essential to understand the extent to which institutional nutritional practices affect the development and well-being of children in care. While early childhood (0-8 years) is critical for adequate health outcomes as adults, children can have a second window, during middle childhood, and adolescence – the period from age 5 to 19 – for growth, psychosocial development, and establishing a healthy relationship with food. Good nutrition during this period fuels growing brains and bodies, and has shown to play a role in improving school attendance, academic performance, and cognition. Emphasis on nutrition may also allow children from disadvantaged backgrounds to experience catch-up growth after stunting in early childhood. While institutions across the country have done relatively well to reduce obvious signs of hunger and malnutrition, it is clear that we now need to shift our focus to more “hidden” signs of malnutrition. According to the World Health Organization, the burden of malnutrition consists of both under-nutrition and overweight and obesity, as well as diet-related noncommunicable diseases. Under-nutrition manifests in four broad forms: wasting, stunting, underweight, and micronutrient deficiencies. 

From observational insights and existing literature, the following are a few factors that influence the quality of nutritional outcomes in institutional care:

  - Lack of nutritional diversity: Limited access to diverse and nutritious foods can result in deficiencies in essential micronutrients, such as iron. Adolescent girls may be especially vulnerable because of increased demands for iron, folate, iodine, and Vitamin A during adolescence, heavy blood loss during menstruation, and parasitic infestations that are commonly reported.
  - Excessive consumption of unhealthy foods: Fast food and prepared snacks are widely available at CCIs in urban areas or CCIs that have frequent donor engagement, replacing healthy, cooked snacks. Access to highly palatable, “junk” foods can also influence taste preferences and affect the eating habits of children.
  - Prioritization of volume: Due to a myriad of reasons including financial constraints, cultural factors, manpower, etc, the  volume of food is often prioritized over nutritional content, leading to good levels of satiety but hidden nutritional deficiencies.
  - Inadequate infrastructure: Kitchens are not always designed to facilitate large- scale cooking. Gaps in the use of effective cooking equipment, storage spaces, and sanitation practices, are observed.

  
**Stakeholders:**

Key stakeholders at an institution include the kitchen staff, leadership, caregiving staff, medical in-charge, donors, and children

- Typically, in an institution, the primary stakeholders involved in nutrition are the **cooks and cooking staff**. They’re responsible for the day-to-day meal preparation and quality of the food provided to children. Cooks come from diverse backgrounds ranging from home cooks who are used to cooking for 2-3 family members to caterers who cook for large events. 
- Apart from the kitchen staff, the **leadership** of the institution plays a crucial role in planning the menu and in coordination with donors for meal sponsorship.
- In well-organized homes, the **medical staff** works closely with the kitchen staff to provide regular feedback on the children’s nutritional needs and to cater to children with special dietary requirements. 
- In homes with an adequate **caregiver**-to-child ratio, we observe caregivers closely monitoring meal times to ensure that children do not waste food and maintain food diversity. However, this is not a common practice, and children are often allowed to skip certain meals or dishes that they are not fond of. 
- In a context unique to CCIs, **donors** play an active role in the nutritional outcomes of children, because institutions tend to engage with donors primarily through food as a donation. Donors can influence meal options, eating behaviour, and children’s relationships with food. Donor sensitivity is paramount to ensuring that institutions can establish positive eating routines for children. Different forms of engagement exist including sponsorship of in-house meals, bringing of externally prepared food, and buying of provisions alongside celebrating events with children during mealtime.
- Most importantly, **children** need to play an active role in offering feedback to the leadership and the kitchen staff on the quality and variety of food on the menu through child participation methods like  children’s committees. However, from our observations, children have limited decision-making power in what they eat. 

  

**Nutritional Outcomes**
  

**Optimal Adult Outcomes**

These outcome indicators typically describe the long-term success seen in the nutritional status of care-leavers. As defined by UNICEF, children from institutions should grow up to be healthy, productive adults who are Safe from preventable nutritional deficiencies and illnesses that affect long-term health status

- Safe from preventable nutritional deficiencies and illnesses that affect long-term health status.
- Physically active, engaging in exercise and sports to support optimal health outcomes.
- Capable of building an emotionally healthy relationship with food, without any disordered eating patterns.
- Of acceptable height, weight, and other indicators of health, relative to their peers from non-institutional settings.
- Well-protected from common infections, in part due to the development of a healthy immune response that is closely linked with the quality of nutritional inputs.

  

**Current Reality**

**From literature**

- According to existing research on care leavers in the UK, adults who lived in institutional care during childhood had a 40% chance of reporting poor health 10 years later. This rose to an 85% chance over the following two decades. (Murray, 2020)
- It is also reported that there are great disparities in health outcomes for children based on the specific institution that they grew up in. 
- According to a study conducted by Udayan Care on care leavers in Delhi, more than 13% of the cohort self-reported an “Unsatisfactory” score on the Physical Health Index, physical health indicators, including the availability of a caregiver, food, funds and health insurance during times of illness, and the availability of certain healthcare amenities, directly correlated to nutritional practices. (Udayan Care, 2019)
- It’s also seen that male care leavers often report better health outcomes than female care leavers, suggesting a strong gendered component to nutritional practices in institutional settings. (Udayan Care, 2019)
  

**From the Field**

- Care leavers are often unaware of their own nutritional needs, and lack the ability to create structured meal plans for their optimal health. 
- Care leavers often associate “good food” with donor-provided, high-calorie meals, and showcase less interest in different food groups, avoiding vegetables and fruits.
- Care leavers show marked gender differences in receiving training for essential life skills like cooking, grocery shopping, cleaning, and maintaining their own meals. 
- Care leavers are unable to self-identify and communicate symptoms of malnourishment and other deficiencies.

  

  

**Optimal Childhood Indicators**

  

These social impact indicators allow us to evaluate the positive nutritional status of children in CCIs

  

Children in institutions show no stunting, wasting, and have height and weight appropriate to their age.

  

Children enjoy a wide variety of food, across different food groups with nutrient diversity.

  

Children have sufficient energy levels through the day, able to easily get through a day of school, after-school activities, and play. 

  

Children have no recurring medical issues that can be improved or influenced by diet.

  

Children are able to self-regulate their consumption, exhibiting awareness of their own eating habits and dietary preferences.

  

Children exhibit a clear understanding of the importance of a healthy diet and know how to choose healthy balanced meals; customized to their needs. 

  

  

**Current Reality**

  

**From literature:**

  

Research suggests that children leaving institutions are unaware of general morbidities and associated nutritional risks. 

  

Studies from Kenya have shown that there is a high recurrence of acute respiratory infections, malaria, and diarrhea linked to the poor nutritional status of children in institutions.

  

From research on institutional outcomes in South India, we know that Vitamin A and B complex deficiency were the most common nutritional deficiency signs among children, and were more prevalent, relative to family settings. 

  

Research has suggested that one out of every four children in institutions in South India suffer from sickness, fatigue, and bad sleep, all indicators of inadequate nutritional practices.

  

According to this research in India, there is accumulating evidence that early malnutrition, marked by stunting, is associated with long-term deficits in cognitive and academic performance, even when social and psychological differences are controlled.

  

According to a meta-analysis that studied children adopted from Romanian orphanages and others, 65% of orphanage children continued to have eating problems even 11 months after adoption

  

  

**From the Field:**

  

Children are often not aware of diverse food types, the value they add and associated life skills like meal planning and cooking.

  

Children are prone to developing an inability to self manage diet or regulate portion sizes, possibly due to food being served by CCI staff in standard quantities. 

  

Children may develop complications in health conditions due to limited access to specialized diets.

  

Children develop a taste preference for sweets, cakes, and ‘donor meals’. In some CCIs, there is an effort to shift focus from donor meals to in-house diets by ensuring outside food brought in is limited.

  

Children are very aware and conscious of the role of donors in the food they eat; their relationship with ‘donor meals’ is often marked by a strong push to eat beyond typical satiety levels.

  

  

**Suggested Childhood Inputs**

_You can find the official recommendations for nutrition from the Juvenile Justice Act attached in the annexure of this document_

  

Diets need to be balanced and efficient to deliver nutritional inputs on par with global standards.

  

Diets need frequent monitoring of nutritional inputs and outputs through metrics such as macro-nutrient/micronutrient composition of the diet, height vs age, weight vs age, and medical reports.

  

Menus and meal plans need to be standardized with the support of qualified nutritionists, doctors, and leadership staff at the institution.

  

Close attention needs to be paid to operationalizing hygiene, food safety, and sanitization routines.

  

Children with deficiencies are identified with appropriate diagnosis and in comparison to relative benchmarks. 

  

Children with nutritional deficiencies are supported with menu upgrades, special diets, and expert consultations.

  

Children spend time with caregivers during meal times, to bond and develop positive associations with food.

  

Allied health concerns, in relation to eating practices are identified through observation & testing, of eating disorders, allergies and medical issues.

  

Children are taught about the food cycle from production to waste disposal.

  

Donor influence on meal times and nutritional quality is regulated.

  

Age-appropriate nutritional intake needs to be considered in designing meal plans and follow-up systems.

  

Caregivers facilitate regular discussions about healthy food habits with children.

  

  

**Current Reality**

  

**From literature:**

  

Existing research on nutritional inputs in childcare institutions suggests that the psychosocial stress of living in an institution influences the generalized chronic under-nutrition reported.

  

Limited funding and reliance on donations for food were frequently mentioned issues, contributing to low diet diversity and resulting in diets high in starches and legumes.

Dietary diversity was reported to be low for children in institutional care, especially in terms of fruits, vegetables and protein.

  

Poor hygiene and sanitation, as shown by existing research often lead to frequent illnesses in children that result in subsequent poor utilization of nutrients.

  

Research shows that older children are often fed the same quantity of the food as the younger children resulting in lower than required intake in older children.

  

  

## From the Field:
- Children are given at least 4 meals a day, typically allowing them to be satiated.
- Meat & eggs, if provided on a regular basis can alleviate protein consumption concerns and prove to be an excellent source of nutrients for children.
- Diets are usually carbohydrate heavy.
- Fruits and vegetables are quickly perishable and more expensive, dissuading caregivers from providing a diverse range of fresh produce.
- Lunch tends to be the most nutritionally dense meal of the day, tilting the balance of the diet plan- breakfast & dinner tend to be simple and nutritionally deficient.
- Menu plans are not usually created with the help of registered nutritionists and doctors; nor are they updated regularly. 
- Donors heavily influence meal timings, meal plans, and eating habits.
- Children are engaged in creating and updating the menu plan through children’s committees, but are not always equipped with the knowledge and skills to contribute effectively.
- Children are often scolded and punished in response to eating habits, versus caregivers adopting a more encouraging, positive framework to help children improve their eating practices.

  

# Key Excerpts from Research

## From Literature

Some of the recurring themes that we saw in the research surrounding nutrition in children in need of care and protection and children living in institutions were: 
  
- **Micronutrient deficiencies**: According to a meta-analysis of the nutritional status of children in care, Vitamin A and B complex deficiency were the most common nutritional deficiency signs among children. Other common deficiencies were iodine, zinc, and albumin. (Sarma, 1991)
- **Caregiver training** greatly influences nutritional outcomes in children. It is essential for caregivers to develop healthy eating practices in children, encouraging diverse tastes and a comprehensive understanding of nutrition - a valuable skill for adulthood. (Moyo, 2018). 
- **Poor hygiene and sanitation** can lead to frequent illness and poor absorption of nutrients. It is important to remember that hygiene and nutrition are closely linked. Often, waste disposal is not considered carefully enough in developing the food cycle at the institution. (Chitty, 2015)
- **Caregiver ratio** is also a crucial metric that influences nutritional practices in an institution. The number of children served by each caregiver is critical to higher quality care. The poor caregiver-to-child ratio not only inhibits social interaction but also influences the way caregivers respond to the needs of the children. This includes crucial dietary needs and practices. Young children in group care often fail to thrive, tend to be sickly, and often demanding of attention - they need consistent caregiving. (Moyo, 2018)
- **Regular feedback** from children, staff, and external stakeholders is essential to improving the quality of food at the institution. Children need to be actively engaged in the food practices at the CCI through children’s committees and feedback boxes. 
- **Eating behaviors** in children in institutions tend to be poorly developed. Studies have suggested that children in institutional care may not learn how to judge feelings of satiety. They may ask for more or less food than they need; with a tendency to overeat when food is available; due to past experiences of irregular availability of food.  in abundance. (MacLean, 2003)
- **Meal timings** should be ritualized, with the focus on caregivers spending adequate time with children during meal times to encourage them to eat complete meals, nudge them to try different foods, and develop long-lasting bonds. Children are shown to positively respond to attention and care during their meal times. (Powell, 2017)

## From the Field

- **Kitchen Facilities & Equipment**

Improved infrastructure for efficient cooking: In well-run CCIs, large-scale cooking appliances are used to improve efficiency in preparation, allowing fewer staff to cater to a large number of children. Many CCIs lack sufficient equipment to cook for large numbers of children, resulting in cooks compromising on the cutting of sufficient vegetables and other nutritional inputs to save time impacting the nutrition level in meals served. 

- **Donor-influenced behavior**

  In most CCIs, meals tend to be the easiest to get sponsored and donors are often seen participating in the meal-time. Type of meals consumed by children are influenced by donor-contributions and their preferences. Children’s relationship with food can be complicated by the frequent involvement of unknown adults in food preparation and mealtimes. Food preferences can be impacted by the frequency of celebratory food such as cakes, biryani, fast food/snacks etc 

- **Meal Plans & Nutritional inputs**

Most CCIs rely on in-house expertise to create meal plans, and these plans are only updated once in 6 months to a year. Lack of expert guidance limits the  nutritional quality of meals, and there is  an overreliance on carbohydrate-heavy meals, with little emphasis on fresh fruits and vegetables.

  - **Hygiene & Waste disposal**

When it comes to influencing the consumption of food and absorption of nutrients from food, hygiene plays an important role in improving nutritional outcomes in children. While many institutions focus on the provision of food, disposal is often not given sufficient consideration. This leads to unhygienic and unsanitary conditions around plate washing and dustbin areas.

- **Small cooking batches** 

In institutions with a small number of children or individual kitchens in each cottage, we have observed that cooks and kitchen staff are able to ensure higher standards of hygiene and cleanliness while being able to customize menu plans based on the individual needs of their set of children.

  

- **Eating behaviours and caregiving guidelines**

We’ve noticed that institutions that encourage small, group settings for children to eat in, allow for caregivers to bond with their children during meal times, reduce food wastage, and monitor the eating behaviors of children with special dietary needs. Close, circular table settings are preferred to long tables that do not support family-style eating habits.
