# Introduction to domain

There is growing evidence that play enhances child development and learning outcomes. Playful interactions with caregivers and other children can help children develop their social-emotional skills, including how to manage their emotions and be in relationships with others; which are for future emotional health and lifelong integration into their communities.

  Different types of play are essential for different forms of development, all necessary for children in institutions.

- Physical play is linked to motor development and some tentative evidence is that it creates a linkage to social development as well. In CCIs, this is mostly achieved through sports or unstructured playtime.
- Unstructured breaks from classes and cognitively demanding tasks improve learning and attention.
- Construction play that involves building and creating large structures has shown to have a relationship with language development, particularly for younger children. 
- Word play, word games, and theatre can all lead to linguistic development.
- Pretend play relates to language development, particularly narrative skills. Children often engage in fantasy-oriented pretense, and this has been linked to improvements in self-regulation of emotions. 
- Board games (particularly those with numbers and linear number sequences) lead to improvements in numeracy/mathematics ability.


## Overview of Play in Child Care Institutions

It is known that adverse childhood events have a negative effect on cognitive performance and correlate  with lower levels of intelligence, academic achievement, executive function, and other developmental outcomes in the lives of vulnerable children exposed to stressors like poverty and abuse. 

Physical activities and extracurricular engagements are important elements in counteracting this negative impact, influencing physical and mental health, in making friendships and for success in school. These activities also improve school readiness, later academic performance and adapting to independent adult life. Specifically, the period of growth at an institution is a period of reorganizing the child’s self-image. Recent research has pointed out that the children’s consistent participation in physical education lessons and additional activities like music, dance, self-defense classes, and theatre can greatly help in building their self-esteem and improving their self-image. 

  
## Stakeholders

The primary stakeholders responsible for creating a supportive environment of play and extracurricular engagement in an institution are the child welfare officers, the leadership of the institution, teachers in school, primary caregivers at the home, volunteers, and other civil society organizations. 

- In a majority of institutions, play and elements of extracurricular activities are primarily determined by the child welfare officer and the leadership of the organization. They often influence the activities available to children in institutions and organize funding for these activities, based on the interests and needs of the children. Leadership that stresses the value of play will make space in their funding and schedule of children to allow for these activities. 
- Volunteers and other civil society organizations play a crucial role in teaching children multiple activities and hobbies including music, art, dance, and photography. Volunteers can fill in niche expertise areas in different elements of play and provide cost-effective alternatives to engaging private service providers. 
- Teachers & house parents are also required to consciously provide space in children’s schedules for play and unstructured free time. 
- Coaches and trainers are sometimes engaged for specific skills, sports, or arts.


From observational insights and existing literature, the following are a few factors that influence the quality of play outcomes in institutional care:
- Access to creative and physical play outlets through physical education, art, music, and theatre is low due to a lack of facilities, and reduced funding.
- In institutions, after-school opportunities for play may be compromised by a lack of safe play areas, because secure open spaces like parks /playgrounds are less common in childcare institutions.
- Children in CCIs are often under a lot of academic pressure from different stakeholders, which often results in compromises on time to play.
- Experience of Trauma: Adversity in life and in particular the experience of trauma and disruption was identified as the most significant barriers to children’s limited engagement.
- Children have limited choices in their daily lives by virtue of rigid routines in CCIs, and this often led to a reluctance to engage when offered a choice to participate in an extracurricular activity


# Play Outcomes
  
## Optimal Adult Outcomes

- Care leavers are able to use skills developed from play and extracurricular engagements to build social relationships between peers.
- Care leavers exhibit typical cognitive and emotional development, relative to peers from non-institutional settings.
- Care leavers showcase resilience, learning from their experiences in play and extracurricular activities to deal with difficult situations.
- Care leavers are confident in their own talents and abilities, building relevant skills while engaging in activities outside traditional schooling. 
- Care leavers manage emotions and stressful life events through engagement in sports, music, theatre, or art. 
- Care leavers develop a strong sense of identity and self-esteem, commonly correlated with exposure to different activities. 

  

  

  

**Current Reality**

  

**From Literature**

  

During critical periods, if the conditions for development, including opportunities to engage in play appropriate for age, are not available at that time it may be difficult or even impossible to develop these functions later in life. Care leavers often find it difficult to catch up with these core developmental abilities.

  

Care leavers do not often have opportunities to engage in active lifestyles that can reduce feelings of loneliness, depression, and the anxiety of isolation. Their interaction with the community is frayed and limited. 

  

Care leavers report struggling with emotional resilience and psychosocial well-being, both outcomes heavily influenced by a lack of leisure and non-academic activities. 

  

  

**From the Field**

  

Care leavers are unable to deal with stress in healthy ways of expression and play, instead relying on unhealthy coping practices.

  

Care leavers do not have the financial security to afford paid extracurricular activities or play opportunities to improve their well-being.

  

Care leavers often find it difficult to include recreational activities, leisure, and sports into their daily schedules given their long working hours and low-paying jobs.

  

Care leavers rarely exhibit a clear understanding of the value of extracurricular engagements and sports.

  

Care leavers lack the community once they leave the institution, to continue engaging in sports and other leisure activities.

  

Care leavers who engaged in regular play in childhood articulated continuing to engage in physical exercise to stay healthy.

  

There is a gender element to play where male care leavers are more likely to continue engaging in physical activities while female care leavers deprioritize physical play.

  

Care leavers rarely have formal training and support to continue developing existing talents in different fields like music, sports, art, and other extracurricular activities. 

  

  

**Play Indicators and Inputs**

  

  

**Optimal Childhood Indicators**

_These social impact indicators allow us to evaluate the positive nutritional status of children in CCIs_

  

Children are able to interact in teams and have group social skills.

  

Children have a stable peer group in the institution that they can lean on for additional support. 

  

Children have a healthy sense of competition and are able to push themselves to excel in their chosen interests.

  

Children have a play-based identity that they develop through regular participation and development.

  

Children are familiar with the types and details of toys, games, sports, music, art, and other extracurricular activities, on par with peers.

  

Children have a healthy relationship with fitness and view it as a part of their lives.

  

All children participate in some group sport that allows them to gain essential teamwork skills.

  

Children perform well on fitness tests as per their age.

  

Children are able to take a healthy approach to losing, without letting challenges affect their sense of self and future performance. 

  

Children are in simple/complex play stages that are age appropriate.

  

Children facilitate conflict resolution strategies on their own when required, utilizing learnings from engaging in group activities.

  

Children have an interest in and are able to leverage skills in play during leisure time.

  

Children show proficiency in art, music, theatre or some form of creative expression that they can rely on for leisure.

  

  

**Current Reality**

  

**From Literature**

  

Children in CCIs exhibited less exploratory play, less varied play, and developmentally lower levels of play than their peers in family based settings. 

  

When compared to children from family-based settings, of the same chronological age, fewer children from CCIs demonstrated comparable play behaviors at each level of play with the exception of symbolic play.

  

Play behaviours of children previously in CCIs were rated lower than those of a comparison group from familial settings. 

  

Children in institutions often demonstrate delays in emotional, social, and physical development, particularly in the absence of planned interventions in play and sports.

Children in institutions have lower levels of socialization compared to a child living in families, primarily driven by lack of exposure. 

  

Children who face peer rejection often show improper socialization, which later reports lower self-esteem and may result in higher levels of depression. 

  

Lack of socialization results in behavior problems such as maladaptive behaviors that interfere with everyday activities.

  

Studies on institutionalization have shown that children often report emotional and social disorders such as anxiety and depression and lack of communication and interpersonal relationships.

  

CCIs often push for higher scores in examinations, and correspondingly reduce play opportunities. This can lead to increased frustration and stress among children, even manifesting in increased violent behavioral challenges. 

  

In cases where child-centered play was introduced in CCIs, levels of socialization markedly improve.

  

  

**From the Field**

  

Children’s interests are significantly influenced by gender stereotypes and local traditions.

  

Children are unfamiliar with most current toys & games, having access only to older donated play items which are rarely refreshed.

  

Children report somewhat high levels of dissatisfaction with school extracurriculars and sports.

  

Many children do not exhibit proficiency in a chosen skill or extracurricular activity outside of academic performance.

  

Children from institutions show difficulties in integrating with children from non-institutional settings in schools. 

  

Children often display social behavior that is incongruent with their age.

  

A few CCIs had children participating at the school, state, and national level mostly in sports, but sometimes in arts too. This is highly dependent on the location, school, and culture of the CCI.

  

Children in institutions are unable to share, show difficulties in prosocial behaviour relative to children in familial settings. 

  

Children often show hesitance in participating in structured exercise or physical play.

  

  

**Suggested Childhood Inputs**

_You can find the official recommendations for play from the Juvenile Justice Act attached in the annexure of this document_

  

Children have diverse avenues to put their energy into, including multiple play opportunities.

  

Children are provided opportunities to sing, dance, write or act, to express their emotions in non-verbal ways. Children need to have access to indoor and outdoor activities with appropriate equipment. Some activities include yoga, meditation, music, television, picnics, cultural programs, gardening, library, dance, and art therapy.

  

Caregivers tell stories to children and encourage them to ask questions to test their attention and memory.

  

Children are provided with time and space to act out imaginary scenes, roles, and activities.

  

In the schedule, time is allocated for children to interact with friends and to promote socialization. 

  

Children are encouraged to test and try a variety of movements in a physically safe environment under supervision, including hopping, swinging, climbing, and doing somersaults.

  

Caregivers limit screen time to healthy levels. Age-appropriate media can have benefits for older children, especially if caregivers watch and play with them.

  

In after-school activities or tuitions, children are taught playful learning approaches in addition to more structured learning approaches like reading, memorization, and worksheets.

  

Community-based programs can be engaged, that offer a wide variety of activities for children.

  

Play therapy is actively explored as a therapeutic modality in institutions by mental health staff. 

  

  

**Current Reality**

  

**From Literature**

  

According to existing research on institutional care, childcare institutions usually do not meet the conditions of a positive learning environment, a prerequisite for children’s development that includes opportunities for healthy exploration and play.

  

Previous research has suggested that many children in institutional care settings often do not have access to extra-curricular learning and activity opportunities which could help deal with their physical, social and emotional needs.

  

An extensive body of literature has documented the effectiveness of play, as a counseling model, in working with children and adolescents. 

  

In CCIs, children do not develop key adaptive skills independently. Adaptive behaviors are built through exposure to different non-academic activities in varied settings. 

  

Studies that looked at role play and language development show that through play, children developed increased competence in their language and literacy skills and they also increased their management and social interaction skills. 

  

Lack of adequate socialization is one of the most important problems of children who are residing in institutions. Lack of play and socialization leads to increased frustration for children. 

  

Looking at institutional care in India, there are reports of a high overall prevalence of inactivity found in children. 

  

There is a gender skew in physical activity, with boys being given more encouragement to play sports.

  

Participation in structured activities, including sports, has been argued to be associated with better social relationships and mental health, but such engagement is lower for children in institutions than children living with families. 

  

  

**From the Field**

  

Toys and board games are often old and under maintained in institutions. They’re mostly donated and hand-me-down equipment that is improperly maintained. Sports equipment is often broken and not replenished because they’re more expensive to purchase.

  

Sports preferences and encouragement are often gendered. Organized sports and sports coaching is often reserved for boys.

  

Play therapy is not commonly used by mental health staff in the institution, even for younger children.

  

Playtime often lacks structured components such as rigorous training or organized competitive play.

  

Routines are rigid, with play being compromised during exam cycles and other activities given a higher priority

  

Extracurricular activities are volunteer-driven and lack consistency because of disrupted delivery and heavy dependence on external resources that are unpaid.

  

Music, dance, and instrument classes while in demand are rarely offered on a regular basis to children in institutions.

  

External opportunities for further training and growth are heavily limited due to constraints of safety, costs, and mobility.

  

Art activities are few and far between but are more common because of the low investment required to encourage children to paint and draw. 

  

During Covid-19, volunteering activities almost entirely stopped and children did not have access to any non-academic activities.

  

Dance and music activities are often encouraged only when there are scheduled performances in institutions or in schools. They are not always encouraged outside of these public performances or events. 

  

Excellent caregivers often use playtime to build relationships with children and to understand their emotions and peer-to-peer interactions. 

  

  

  

**Key Excerpts from Research**

  

**From Literature**

  

**Play is crucial for development:** From a developmental perspective, play allows children to slowly practice different behavioural and social skills, learning key physical and communication abilities from their peers. For social competence, emotional intelligence and resilience, creativity, and problem-solving skills, play is crucial. (Nijhof, 2018)

  

**Play and caregiving:** The playful interactions that children have with their caregivers, give the caregivers plenty of opportunities to understand children better, their fears, their anxieties, and their behavioral patterns with other children. (Lillard, 2013)

  

**Play and emotional expression:** Play may also allow for the expression of frustration and rage, to cope with environmental challenges, leading to improved mental health outcomes. (Ahloy-Dallaire, 2018)

  

**Physical activity is key for well-being:** Engagement in physical activity has consistently been found to be associated with positive outcomes for children, including improved physical, mental, and emotional well-being. (Eime, 2013)

  

**School engagement is key:** In schools, the need for after-school activities and extracurricular engagement must be equally prioritized, relative to the general push for academic excellence. Otherwise, school engagement might suffer, and holistic learning is negatively affected. (McLean, 2020)

  

**Play therapy is an effective modality:** There’s a bit of a communication gap between children and adults. Depending on age and stage of development, children simply don’t have the language skills of adults. Children learn to understand the world and their place in it through play. It’s where they’re free to act out their inner feelings and deepest emotions. Play therapy can be used to actively explore children’s feelings. (Shrinivasa, 2019)

  

**Sports and Extracurricular activities as an effective tool of caregiving:** Research has shown that structured play through sports or training in music, art, dance, and theatre has the ability to improve social skills, build resilience and confidence, minimize disruptive effects of change, manage emotions and stress better, and allow children to develop their sense of self. (Milteer, 2012)

**From the Field**

  

Play expectations are gendered. In institutional settings, boys are often encouraged to participate in physical activity and organized sports while girls are primarily given opportunities to play unstructured games and asked to explore dance, and music as leisure activities. Interestingly while paid external coaching for sports is rarely present, in cases where it is, it is mostly provided for boys.

  

Play and extracurricular activities are often not a high priority for institutions. Driven by resource constraints and increasing academic pressure, children are not always provided with well-thought, structured activities of engagement. Their routines are rigid, often with multiple after-school tuitions, but insufficient time for unstructured and structured leisure activities.

  

Play equipment and infrastructure are typically donated, and often insufficient or of low quality. Sets of games, puzzles, and toys are often found to be incomplete or outdated. Few toys that are in good condition are typically restricted for use.

  

Training for play and extracurricular activities such as music, art, dance, theatre etc. is limited. Due to financial constraints, most of these services are offered by volunteers, and not by trained instructors or professionals.

  

Play therapy is rarely promoted as a useful modality to address social and behavioral concerns in children. This may be due to lack of training, availability of service providers specialized in this modality, or cost issues.

  

Covid-19 has had a major impact on play and extracurricular activities in institutions. With lockdowns and major financial constraints in institutions, extracurricular activities were the first to be cut. Volunteers could not enter institutions and digital services were mostly inaccessible.

  

Children’s exposure to diverse activities of engagement is heavily controlled and constrained because of safety and resource constraints. Children often have to give up progression in activities due to logistical constraints involved in participation in external events, competitions etc. 

  

Digital media presence at CCIs has increased significantly over the last few years, and children often avoid physical activity and other diverse forms of play in favor of digital time. TV time also requires less staff numbers to facilitate as opposed to play time.

  

**Play - Juvenile Justice Model Rules, 2016**

  

Individual Care Plan, a comprehensive development plan for a child based on age and gender-specific needs and case history of the child, is to be prepared in consultation with the child  in order to restore the child’s self-esteem, dignity and self-worth and nurture him into a responsible citizen and accordingly the plan shall address the following, including but not limited to leisure, creativity and play, including any special needs.
