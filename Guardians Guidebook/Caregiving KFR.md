# Introduction to the domain

Care is a primary need for all children, driven by the presence and actions of a clearly identified, stable adult who creates a safe, nurturing, and emotionally secure environment for each child. The relationship between the child and the caregiver should provide physical and psychological security for the child. Bolstering access to supportive, trustworthy, and trained caregivers at the institution is a key investment for our childcare institutions and the children we aim to support.

  
Following are some principles that govern ideal caregiving practices:

- Individualisation: For children, a primary need in caregiving is the belief that there is someone who cares for them as separate, distinct human beings, this feeling of belonging to a primary caregiver that they can reach out to for anything that they need. 
- Positive Caregiving: A key assumption in caregiving is that any positive life experience, any reminder of happiness and satisfaction, no matter how tiny or how short the feeling is, strengthens the child’s emotional safety. 
- Zero tolerance for bias and discrimination: It is essential for all institutions to be concerned about the right to equality and non-discrimination of children in care.
- Consistency in caregiving: According to a paper that studied caregiving interventions, we need to avoid instability and inconsistency of caregiving, especially for younger children. Changing sets of volunteers and donors who visit the children may also compound this feeling of instability in the institutional context.
- Openness and transparency: Caregivers need to be honest in expressing their emotions about children’s actions and beliefs. Having conversations about others’ feelings is required too as it helps children build empathy, helping them recognize that the staff are not simply figures of authority, but are full-fledged people too.

## Overview of Caregiving in Child Care Institutions

A major challenge for Child Care Institutions is in fostering a sensitive and emotionally secure caregiver-child relationship. Multiple studies in domains of child development, caregiving and psychology suggest that the quality of care is more of a determinant of the long-term success of children as compared to factors such as type of care (family-based or institutional)

Observations at institutions have revealed that deficits in caregiving are often related to both structural problems (including a high density of children, low caregiver-child ratios, high staff churn) and sufficiency of caregiver skills and mindsets/ Sensitive and responsive caregiving is a requirement for the healthy neurophysiological, physical and psychological development of a child. From existing research and our own experience in institutions, it is clear that a motivated and skilled caregiver can dramatically alter outcomes for children and for the institution. 


## Stakeholders
- In an institutional context, the primary responsibility of creating empowering environments for children lies with the caregivers/house parents, the leadership and child welfare officers, mental health staff, and every adult with regular access to the children. 
- Caregivers and house parents are the primary caregivers at an institution, and they spend the most amount of time with their children, paying close attention to their emotional needs and supporting their day-to-day activities. Caregivers need to ideally spend a majority of their time with the children, engaging in structured and unstructured activities or leisure time with the children. 
- Leadership and child welfare officers also play a crucial role in the recruitment, training, and regular monitoring and evaluation of caregiver performance. They also set the tone for the right approach with children, offering inputs on disciplining, and setting clear boundaries and expectations on what is expected of the caregivers. 
- Mental health staff work closely with the caregivers to address difficult behavioral concerns and offer insights into the children’s attachment patterns so that caregivers can appropriately modulate their response.
- All members of the institution are actively involved in caregiving, because any adult presence can serve the caregiving needs of children, and can heavily influence children’s attachment patterns.


# Caregiving Outcomes

## Optimal Adult Outcomes

- Care leavers leave the institution with increased self-esteem and belief that they are worthy of love, care, and affection. 
- Care leavers are able to manage during times of duress and change.
- Care leavers, if they become parents, will be able to provide nurturing care, learning from caregiving styles that they have been exposed to at the institution.
- Care leavers will be able to identify and avoid risky situations and behaviors, and make choices keeping their best interest in mind including aspects such as safety, career, finances etc.
- Care leavers are able to experience positive and supportive relationships with their support system as adults.
- Care leavers prioritize their personal well-being and work on improving their own lives.
- Care leavers should be secure in their choices and be able to resist negative peer influences.
- Care leavers are able to ask for help when required.
- Care leavers are able to create and pursue goals for life and career.
- Care leavers view their childhoods at the CCI positively.
- Care leavers are able to leverage values, habits and mindsets learned through interactions with caregivers towards making decisions and navigating adult life.

  

## Current Reality


### From Literature

- Care leavers report high levels of isolation amongst peers
- Care leavers tend to view adults in their lives as service providers and authority figures, rather than caregivers who truly care for their growth and development
- Care leavers report challenges in creating a network of chosen family and friends in their community 
- Care leavers often do not have a person to reach out to during times of duress
- Care leavers have lower levels of educational attainment, higher changes of being unemployed and increased rates of mental illness and substance abuse relative to the general population
- A majority of care leavers reported lower than average levels of emotional and behaviour health  in studies from the UK
- According to some studies, many care leavers have indiscriminate social behaviors or indiscriminate friendliness, which may be correlated to insecure attachment.

### From the Field

- Care leavers sometimes struggle to modulate their response to adults and peers in their lives, either choosing to completely withdraw from their presence or become intensely attached in very short periods of time.
- Care leavers also find it challenging to modulate their risk taking behaviours, ranging from refusal to try out new activities to engaging in high-risk behaviours with strangers.
- Care leavers lack choices in fulfilling different emotional needs and they’re unable to identify and grow different types of relationships like mentors, friends, romantic partners, acquaintances etc. 
- Care leavers are often unable to go back and seek help from caregivers, due to fear of authority growing up in institutional care.
- Care leavers tend to have challenges in building long sustaining positive relationships because they lack exposure to healthy attachment patterns and communication styles.

  

# Caregiving Indicators and Inputs

## Optimal Childhood Indicators
_These social impact indicators allow us to evaluate the positive caregiving status of children in CCIs_

- Children in institutions should report motivation to perform well in school and other extracurricular activities
- Children are able to feel secure and safe at the institution and with the caregivers there.
- Children are able to handle failures and challenges with resilience.
- Children are able to point out one adult within the institutional care setting that they trust and can rely on for support.
- Children report reduced depressive symptoms and other markers of mental health conditions associated with care environment.
- Children have sufficient social self-efficacy, being able to partake in activities that can create meaningful relationships with trusted adults and peers. 
- Conflict and violent incidents amongst children are within what is expected for the age group. 
- Children articulate less fear and more trust when discussing their relationship with caregivers.
- Children have more willingness to try new things and reduced fear of failure.
- Children have a sense of belonging, of being liked for who they are and cared for as a person.
- Children do not feel judged for difficulties that they go through.
- Children report no instances of abuse and violence at the institution.


## Current Reality

### From Literature

- In literature from India, we know that a common complaint in CCIs from the children is that the staff does not understand them well enough to take care of them.
- Children from institutions have reported having been victims of corporal punishment as a tool for discipline.
- In a systematic review on institutional childcare, it was shown that children may develop a low-quality attachment bond with their primary caregivers. Children in institutions often display indiscriminate friendliness that is linked with their ability to socialize safely.
- Children in institutions have documented various neurological, socioemotional, and behavioral problems related to quality of care.
- Children in institutions report poor attention, concentration, executive function, and difficulties with school performance, which are correlated to limited individualized adult mentorship.
- Children in institutional care also report challenges with emotional regulation, displaying temper tantrums, clinging behavior, and a tendency to externalize problems. They are also more prone to depression & anxiety.

### From the Field

- While some children have positive relationships with caregivers, others have strained and turbulent relationships, marred by anger, distrust and fear. 
- Children are fearful of all adults, looking at them as authority figures.
- Children keep secrets and avoid bringing up conflicting, controversial information with caregivers, indicative of a lack of safety in their relationships.
- Many children show indiscriminately friendly behavior with all adults who visit them at the institution, including volunteers and donors. 
- Many children do not express feeling loved and cared for at the institution, often eager to leave the institution.
- Some children resort to self-harm and poor coping practices while dealing with frustration and other negative stressors in their lives.
- Children may not have relationships of trust and love with their peers at the institution and problematic behaviors and peer-to-peer abuse and bullying are somewhat common.
- Children attempt to seek the attention of caregivers, sometimes with violent outbursts or mischief, but many of them go unnoticed due to a large number of children and few caregivers.



# Suggested Childhood Inputs
_You can find the official recommendations for caregiving from the Juvenile Justice Act attached in the annexure of this document_

- Caregivers support involvement of the children in decision making.
- Caregivers should be happy, satisfied in their roles and excited to be with children.
- Caregivers provide individualized attention and time to respond to children’s customized needs.
- Caregivers use trauma-sensitive communication techniques to work with children.
- Caregivers are honest and open about children’s emotional expression, offering a judgment-free space for children to express negative emotions.
- Caregivers actively avoid discriminating or treating children differently in the group.
- Caregivers do not use retraumatizing or abusive language while working with children.
- Caregivers should reward good behaviour, encouraging a positive feedback loop.
- Caregivers should be consistent in applying appropriate consequences for behaviours in children, explaining the rationale for their decision each and every time.
- Caregivers should serve as mentors for the children, as positive role models that they can learn from.
- Caregivers should be applying updated care practices based on regular training.
- Caregivers need to engage in reciprocal verbal and non-veral communication with the children, including dedicating time for play with the children.
- Institutions need to improve the caregiver to child ratio and prevent frequent disruptions in caregiving due to churn or too many rotations.
- Institutions should implement an in-house system of monitoring and supervision to encourage caregivers to implement training principles with children.
- Beyond improving caregiver-child attachment, caregiver trainings should also focus on prevention of violence and abuse in institutional care.
- Caregivers should be verified as safe to work with children, via systems such as police verification and background checks.


## Current Reality

### From Literature

- Several studies reported that caregivers they spoke to used negative expressions when asked to describe the children in their care. These negative expressions included both externalizing descriptors such as disobedient, disrespectful, selfish, and aggressive; and internalizing descriptors such as being insecure, unhappy, and distressed, in reference to their view of their job.
- A low caregiver to child ratio has been reported in a majority of institutions, affecting their ability offer individualized care.
- Many caregivers have been reported as lacking the training and skills to respond sufficiently to the emotional needs of children.
- Support groups for caregivers have shown to have a positive impact on the overall mental state of caregivers and influenced the way they relate to children.
- Many caregivers report feeling burnt out and complain of poor working conditions, often leading to a high turnover rate in institutions.
- Caregivers report feeling affected by the intense emotions that children experience, particularly children who have experienced very traumatic incidents in their past. Caregivers often lack the appropriate support systems and tools to process these emotions.
- Studies have shown that caregivers in institutions have high levels of anxiety and communicated little with the children in their care.
- Emotional deprivation is seen in some institutions where children lack supportive interpersonal interactions with the staff.
- Caregivers may be unable to attend to children’s emotional and relational needs as a result of the lack of  training, time, staff support, and organizational capacity. 
- Caregivers are often reported to exercise authority over their children, instead of building trust and encouraging children to participate in decision-making involving their lives. 

### From the Field
- Most caregivers that we spoke to spent a significant amount of time and effort on logistical, administrative, and compliance work, and had to balance this with spending time with children. Most institutions lacked dedicated staff or bandwidth to be able to do both effectively. 
- Caregivers are often juggling multiple roles, and hence are not able to spend 100% of their time with children, which is often a requirement to be able to provide individualized support to large numbers of children.
- Due to staffing constraints, caregivers are only able to offer 1-on-1 support very sporadically and spend more time interacting with children in groups.
- Caregivers do not have the training to deal with complex cases of trauma and are often at a loss as to how to support the child.
- Caregivers struggle to work with children with behavioral difficulties and are unable to implement non-violent consequence systems.
- Caregivers are not trained regularly, nor are they given opportunities to upskill.
- Caregiver skill level often varies widely within the same institution, and this lack of standardization of protocol and expectations leads to mixed and sometimes conflicting messaging to children.
- Caregivers often come from challenging situations themselves, and coupled with the responsibilities of dealing with complex trauma that children bring to them, are unable to deal with the challenges. They do not typically have access to dedicated mental health support.
- Caregivers are often burnt out and stretched thin after a few years on the job, and then are unable to provide the emotional bandwidth to extend daily support to children.
- Caregivers are often not paid competitively, with the primary perks of the job being a residence on campus and education for their own children. There are usually limited opportunities for growth.
- Caregivers have not gone through any formalized training, and have mostly learned on the job.
- Caregivers sometimes find it difficult to be neutral or not show bias while working with groups of children, leading to variances in the children’s ability to bond with them. 


# Key Excerpts from Research

## From Literature

- Behavioural consequences of sub-optimal care: Across studies of institutionalized children, a majority of them displayed disorganized attachment patterns, relative to children in families. Research has shown that there are long-term behavioural consequences to these attachment patterns in children. (MacLean, 2003)
- Cognitive & developmental consequences of sub-optimal care: Coupled with the experience of violence and abuse in institutions, inadequate care can affect the child’s stress response system, and lead to a long-term negative impact on the neurodevelopment of the child. (MacLean, 2003)
- Quality of care is what matters: Research indicates that multiple negative outcomes of institutionalization can be subverted if CCIs are financially and professionally supported towards better care practices. (Whetten, 2009)
- Caregiver training, structural enhancements, and enriched caregiving environments in CCIs have shown beneficial effects on the child’s emotional, social, and cognitive development. With a focus on improving the social caregiver-children bonds, we can positively influence children’s general emotional, behavioral and mental development. (Hermenau, 2017)
- The research suggests that background checks are an effective tool to ensure that adults who are employed at the institution are safe for children to be around. caregivers should not have shown any behaviour in the past that could potentially be dangerous to the children, including violent or self-destructive behaviours. Caregivers should not be suffering from any substance use disorders, criminal behaviour, or habituation to drugs. Caregiver checks need to be complete, with police verification. (Rainbow Foundation India, 2016)
- Comprehensive caregiver training needs to include modules on the rights of the child, attachment, discipline techniques, child development, gender roles, sexual abuse and prevention, communication skills, conflict resolution, and stress management. (Berument, 2013)
- Caregiver mindsets can also influence caregiving practices and we need to look for caregivers that showcase empathy, non-judgemental attitudes, unconditional positive regard, and honesty. (Khalid, 2022)
- Establishing continuity of caregivers is imperative to creating an environment of trust. Caregivers need to prepare the children in case they are leaving the institution for a different job. Caregivers should be as constant as possible and, when about to leave their jobs for any reason, they should know how to prepare the children to de-attach. (Almas, 2020)

## From the Field

- Caregivers often double up doing administrative work, compliance oriented work and other tasks due to staff shortages. This impacts their ability to focus on providing 1-on-1 individualized time to the children, especially in the larger CCIs. 
- The staff to child ratio is large and lack of support/knowledge lead to a lack of individualization of care and limited specialized support being provided to children with learning difficulties or behavioral challenges.
- In most institutions, caregivers do not come with any formal training and learn on the job.
- Caregivers often draw a minimal salary without many growth opportunities. Their stay at the institution comes with job perks such as free accommodation and education for their children, which many caregivers articulated as the primary incentive for the role outside of enjoying the work itself.
- Caregivers are not trained in non-violent behavior management and find it challenging to work with large numbers of children without a clear protocol on this.
- The caregivers we spoke to frequently face challenges such as burnout, stress, stretched bandwidth, and fear of consequences for making mistakes. They typically lack access to support groups, therapy, learning communities, etc. that could help them tackle these challenges.
- Most caregivers live at the CCI 24/7 with minimal time off.
- Most caregivers that we spoke to articulated that the routine is the main tool that empowers them to be able to work with large numbers of children. This tool provides distinct advantages in group care settings in ensuring safety, access to opportunity, and building habits such as discipline and consistency in children. On the flip-side, an over-reliance on routine has the additional consequence of reduced personalization & customization based on the individual child’s needs, which can stagnate their growth.
