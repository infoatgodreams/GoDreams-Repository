# Introduction

Children in CCIs frequently are exposed to traumatic events pre-admission to CCIs and require specialized counselling, which is rarely available.  In addition to this, the structured group environment of the home & high child:caregiver ratios lead to very limited personlized attention for each child.  Children are also exposed to violence, bullying etc. at the CCI and school. According to one study, 56% of children in institutional care in 13 Indian states reported having experiences physical abuse at the institution. 

Young adults often lack familial support systems, and typically have to independently deal with long term mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, adhd & suicidal ideation. Insitutionalization has been linked to poorer adult outcomes, particularly cognitive and emotional developmental issues such as lower IQ, poor attachment patterns, behavioral issues and distrust of others. 


# The Gold Standard in Mental Health

## Target Outcomes

- Young adults show few somatic symptoms that are associated with institutional upbringing.
- Young adults are able to smoothly transition into society, and have a healthy sense of self, decision making abilities and other crucial life skills. 
- Young adults are able to create pseudo familial groups and leverage support systems around them. 
- Young adults do not get involved in substance abuse and unsafe/criminal activities. 

## Indicative Outputs

- Caregivers have low stress levels and are happy at their jobs
- Children have normal attachment patterns
- Children have minimal behavioral challenges outside of the norm
- Children have safe spaces and support systems that they actively leverage
- Children have adult role models with frequent interaction




# Key Levers at CCIs


> [!info]- Individualization of Care
> - Staff : Child ratios are minimal (5:1)
> - Individual care plans are used and updated for all children
> - Trauma assessment conducted during admission and periodically thereafter
> - Admission processes rooted in individualized mental and emotional support
> - Children have private/personal spaces and safe peer groups
> - Individual behavioral challenges are responded to quickly and without physical or emotional violence
> - Confidential feedback systems available for children to express their views



> [!info]- Staff Practices
> - Caregivers trained in trauma informed care and conducting restorative circles with children
> - Caregiver exits and onboarding rooted in supporting positive attachment behavior among children
> - Staff attrition minimized 
> - Strong M&E, learning circles and Support Systems for staff
> - Mental health support available for CCI staff
> - Caregivers are able to create safe and personal relationships with children
> - Caregivers trained in behavior management , language use guidelines
> - Non caregiving staff, external adults sensitized (school staff, visitors, parents)
>


> [!info]- CCI Environment and Culture
> - All scheduled events such as lunch/dinner, play time etc. are planned keeping the opportunity for caregiver:child interaction and building a positive cci culture in mind
> - CCI should be a place that children associate with sense of safety, joy and "home-like" feeling
> - CCI staff and leadership are trained to integrate core values of the institution in their actions with and around children and with and around each-other at the CCI
> - Security cameras and other measures in place to ensure physical safety
> - Private "child-only" spaces created for children
> - Counselling spaces created that ensure privacy for children

>[!info]- Children's Choice and Self Determination
> - Children have strong feedback systems in place through feedback boxes, children's committees and other methods
> - Children have personal spaces and child first areas within the institution (visitation limited)
> - Children have multiple avenues for self expression through art/music/sport etc. 
> - Children's schedules, while being sufficiently regimentated to ensure safety, are also open ended enough to allow for flexibility and preferences


>[!info]- Relationships and Mentorship
> - All children have role models with frequent interaction
> - Family like-groups built & cultivated  within the CCI and with relevant external stakeholders
> - Peer-peer groups and relationships are actively encouraged and cultivated


>[!info]- Access to professional support
> - Children have access to regular counseling from qualified cousellors
> - Children have access to qualified psychiatrist on request or recommendation by concerned stakeholders
> - Required medications are tracked and administered by CCI staff on prescription by a qualified psychiatrist after consent taken from concerned parties
> - Children have access to regular formal and informal life-skill training and support



Some of the key **challenges and opportunities that exist in this space** are:

> [!bug]- Traditional Mindsets towards mental health
> - Mental health being viewed as a good to have and not an essential 
> - Negative/inappropriate language use towards or around children
> - Physical abuse as a response to behavioral issues
> - Peer on peer abuse normalized and perpetuated
> - Counsellor confidentiality broken : Counselling viewed as a way for caregivers to get inside information about children

## Literature Review

 - There is exhaustive research done and content available on mental health outcomes and support systems for children. Current realities have informally been mapped to care-leaver outcomes as observed in the Indian system.

## CCI Immersion

- The Goal of the immersion phase in mental health is to: 
	- Gauge the 'feeling of a safe space' among children at the home
	- Gauge children's participation in CCI affairs
	- Gauge the CCI culture and environments affects on childrens mental health
	- Identify challenge areas and best practices among CCI staff and other adult stakeholders
	- Map the current mental health infrastructure available to the CCI and CNCP
