# Introduction to the domain

According to the Centre for Disease Control in the US,  being mentally healthy during childhood means reaching developmental and emotional milestones, learning healthy social skills, and developing healthy coping patterns for when there are problems. Mentally healthy children have a positive quality of life and can function well at home, in school, and in their communities.

Existing research also shows that childhood and adolescence are critical stages of life for mental health, given that the brain is rapidly growing, and personalities are slowly taking shape. Children and adolescents acquire cognitive and social-emotional skills that shape their future mental health and are important for assuming adult roles in society.The quality of the environment where children and adolescents grow up shapes their well-being and development. Early negative experiences in homes, such as exposure to violence, the mental illness of a parent or other caregiver, bullying, and poverty, increase the risk of mental health conditions. 

Importantly, mental health conditions, such as childhood epilepsy, developmental disabilities, depression, anxiety, and behavioral disorders, are major causes of illness and disability among young people. The consequences of not addressing mental health and psychosocial development for children and adolescents extend to adulthood and can limit opportunities for leading fulfilling lives.


 
 ## Overview of Mental Health in Child Care Institutions

Countries like India with the highest rates of institutionalized children often suffer from major resource constraints. Additionally, research suggests that children growing up in resource-poor settings, such as childcare institutions are more vulnerable to traumatic grief and compromised cognitive and emotional development.
Institutions that are under-resourced with low caregiver numbers affect the mental health of children in all spheres of their lives and prevent them from having the security and structures required to grow, thrive, and develop. Living environments need to be designed to protect and promote their well-being. 

There are multiple warning signs and potentially distressing precipitating factors in an institution that should be monitored to safeguard the mental well-being of children. 
- Childhood emotional neglect occurs when caregivers are unable to respond adequately to their child’s emotional needs. This can often lead to children developing unhealthy emotional patterns and creating trust deficits in caregiver-children relationships. Poor self-esteem, higher levels of antisocial behaviors, and inability to form social relationships are common consequences of neglect.
- Children who have been abused in any form are unable to securely communicate their emotions. Adult survivors of child abuse may experience anxiety, sadness, or rage for no apparent reason.
- Studies have also shown that the prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems among children and adolescents brought up in institutional homes is higher as compared with similarly aged children. The emotional and behavioral problems can present as defensiveness, sadness, difficulty forming friendships with many children, frequent lying, crying, shouting, screaming, stealing, and physical violence.
-  familial relationships are highly likely to result from the significant time and monetary investment involved in arranging meetings, resentment in children because of the absence of parental investment and the stigma, shame associated from being involved in the system. 
- Some children struggle with mental illness and developmental disorders including depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. ADHD, autism, and learning disabilities are often undiagnosed and untreated. 
- Research from the Duke Centre for Global Health has suggested that the development of positive child outcomes (such as psychosocial well-being) is maybe dependent primarily on the availability of certain components of quality of care rather than the living situation (family-based versus institutional) itself where the children receive care. Higher levels of food security, quality of shelter, quality of caregiving, and access to health care services significantly predicted more positive psychosocial well-being. Institutions can and should focus heavily on improving markers of psychosocial wellbeing of children in care.



## Stakeholders
In an institution, the primary stakeholders responsible for the mental well-being of children include trained mental health professionals, caregivers, and the leadership of the institution. 

  
- It is recommended that all institutions employ **trained counselors and social workers** to offer 1-1 and group counseling services to children in institutions. This is particularly important because children often come from backgrounds of abandonment, trauma, and abuse that require professional help. However, often, the ratio of counselors to children rarely allows for regular personal interaction.
- **Primary caregivers/House parents** also play an important role in mental health support because they act as the front-line mental health workers in institutions. Children often feel more comfortable bringing up concerns with house parents and they spend more time with the house parents, allowing conversations to happen in non-interview-like settings. Specifically, it is clear that caregivers play a pivotal role from the moment of placement, providing information, creating opportunities for participation, 
- The **leadership** and **child welfare officers** set the tone for the emphasis on mental health in the institution because they determine the mindset and attitude towards mental health concerns. Being open to children’s feedback, adopting progressive values, and creating a culture of openness in the institution can have a huge impact on the mental well-being of children in care. 

  
# Mental Health Outcomes

## Optimal Adult Outcomes

_These outcome indicators typically describe the long-term success seen in the mental well-being of care-leavers_

- Care leavers are able to build and maintain positive relationships with others.
- Creating positive relationships with others is essential, including the expression of empathy, affection, and intimacy. 
- Careleavers ideally only display few negative somatic symptoms that are associated with institutional upbringing. 
- Care leavers are able to build crucial habits, skills, and mindsets that set them up for independence.
- Care leavers don’t get involved in substance abuse or unsafe/criminal activities. If they do, they are able to identify and seek out support.
- Care leavers are able to cope with their own emotions or emotional distress independently where required.
- Care leavers are able to leverage resources around them or social systems to support themselves through periods of stress.
- Care leavers are able to reflect and identify the need for mental health support.
- Care leavers understand the mental health ecosystem and are able to access support where required.
- Care leavers are able to self-regulate their own decisions and behavior through a balanced response to social pressures, individual goals, and constraints.



## Current Reality

### From Literature:  

- According to existing research on care-leavers in India, it has been reported that 86% of a representative cohort face recurring emotional distress that affects psychosocial well-being.
- Care leavers experience a high degree of worry about their futures but typically do not have access to a support system to deal with those feelings.
- 10% of care leavers from a study conducted by Udayan Care report feelings of loneliness, isolation, and the inability to find caring pseudo-families or communities of support. 
- Care leavers often struggle with emotional dysregulation and lack the awareness, vocabulary and training to express their feelings and sentiments. They report suffering from mood swings, anger, and irritability. 
- Crucially, there is a gender dynamic here, where women care leavers reported more symptoms of cognitive, emotional, and functional mental health issues as compared to the men. Women were more like to be easily tired, have mood dysregulation, sleep, and food disturbances whereas more men reported having violent thoughts.
- An overwhelming majority of care leavers reported an inability to form and maintain friendships, a statistic that seems to affect men more than women. This also holds true for romantic relationships, and here too, men seemingly struggle more than women. 
- Familial relationships are often strained and care leavers were unable to maintain relationships with their parents. There is not much difference between the genders in terms of maintaining relationships with biological parents or siblings during their adulthood.
- Some of the literature points to “Socially indiscriminate attachment behavior” among care leavers, which can result in unsafe situations and interactions with others.


### From the Field:

- Care leavers reported being unable to manage independently because they’re not used to being solely responsible for their health, education and mental-well being.
- Some care leavers articulate looking back at their life in the children’s homes with fondness, and would frequently visit.
- Some care leavers expressed distress at not having access to records of their childhoods in institutions in the form of pictures etc.
- Care leavers find it difficult to mingle with peers in their universities and workplaces, reporting a feeling of separateness from their peers in these spaces.
- Care leavers report higher rates of negative habits including smoking, drug use, and alcohol use.
- Care leavers are not often in regular therapy or do not choose to access professional mental health support. While care leavers have access to mental health services at the institution, they rarely have regular therapeutic support once they leave; access to mental health is harder.
- Care leavers find it harder to function without the structure that institutional care provides.
- Some care leavers reported switching between jobs frequently, due to struggles maintaining relationships with peers or management at workplaces.
  

# Mental Health Indicators and Inputs

## Optimal Childhood Indicators
_These social impact indicators allow us to evaluate the positive mental well-being of children in CCIs_

- Children have regular attachment patterns with other children and adults and are able to discern what’s appropriate with people of varying degrees of closeness.
- Children have minimal behavioral challenges outside of what is expected for their age, using healthy modalities to deal with conflict and issues with authority. 
- Children exhibit resilience in the face of struggle, and are able to focus on problem-solving instead of resorting to unhealthy coping patterns. 
- Children show that they are able to actively leverage and use existing safe spaces and support systems at the institution.
- Young children with low self-esteem begin perceiving themselves as more competent and confident after mental health interventions at the institution. 
- Children have become equipped to identify negative emotions using tangible tools and respond or report them to trusted caregivers where required.
- Children showcase a clear understanding that their emotions are separate from their behaviors, and behaviors do not need to be driven by emotions.
- Children clear recognize harmful gender stereotypes as social constructs that can be harmful and they learn to play an active role in altering harmful behavior.
- Children report high levels of satisfaction with their time at the institution and adopt an overall happy, positive attitude towards their stay.
- The number of mental health and behavioural concerns exhibited by children at an institution is on par with familial and community settings.



## Current Reality

### From Literature:

- Research shows that children in CCIs often have to deal with attachment disorders, behavioral and thinking disorders including mood disorders, delinquency, impulsivity, inhibition, violence, and failures in learning.
- It is also known that children with trauma are also prone to committing acts of self-injury, suicide and have higher rates of psychiatric disorders. 
- From intervention studies in caregiving, we know that children with a history of early institutional care showed more academic difficulties and deficits in social skills, such as maintaining trustful interpersonal relationships. 
- From research on institutional care, we know that many children-develop long-term mental health difficulties including depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation.
- Children in institutions show a lack of social boundaries displaying indiscriminately sociable behaviour pattern. 
- It is also reported that children who experienced institutional care had reduced cognitive processing speed compared to the comparison group.
- Children in institutions in Delhi reported that isolation and loneliness were the most common problems; describing their inability to integrate with the community. 
- According to research in India, we know that some older children accepted that many times they smoked and chewed tobacco to avoid tension and be carefree. Some others reported that they often used pain relieving balms as inhalants to relieve tension and anxiety.
  

### From the Field:

- Children often feel home-sick and abandoned by their parents, often displayed through emotional outbursts and sudden temper tantrums.
- Children have complicated relationships with their parents and families, often swinging between intense affection and apathy.
- Children often report behaviour challenges in school and the institution, particularly with bullying and peer-interaction difficulties.
- Children show indiscriminate friendliness and unhealthy attachment patterns with adults, unable to use different approaches to interact with donors, patrons and staff members at the institution.
- Children are unable to form strong bonds with their caregivers because of high turnover and low caregiver-to-children ratio. 
- Children do not have clear life objectives unable to find meaning/purpose that can drive performance.
- Older children display a clear lack of independent living skills, including poor social and relationship skills to integrate with the community.
- Children sometimes resort to substance abuse, driven by peer pressure and stress.
- Children often lack gender sensitivity and struggle to establish friendly relationships with the other gender. 
- Children are often highly excited to receive any adult attention, leaving them open to unhealthy relationship patterns in the future. 


# Suggested Childhood Inputs

_You can find the official recommendations for mental health from the Juvenile Justice Act attached in the annexure of this document_

  
- When it comes to caregivers and mental health providers, the key indicators of success seem to be regular training, supervision, low turnover, establishing continuity, and low child-caregiver ratios.
- Children must receive care from caregivers that have low-stress levels and are happy at their jobs.
- Children need regular time with their caregivers and counsellors through story-time, a time during meals, and regular unstructured talk time to discuss their day, their memories, and their challenges. 
- Small group settings are essential to support bonding between caregivers and children, specifically for children with a history of trauma.
- Children have choice and control in their day-to-day decision-making, in an age appropriate manner. They are made well aware of their rights and responsibilities. Children make crucial decisions on their mental health programs along with the counsellor and caregiver, increasing participation, ownership, and effectiveness of the program.
- Children make crucial decisions with the caregiver and the counsellor, increasing participation and as a result, the effectiveness of any mental health program. 
- When it comes to discipline, children need to have task clarity, consistency, and interpersonal boundaries. Disciplinary strategies have to be rooted in kindness and compassion.
- Counsellors build on children’s interests and develop coping skills for them to fall back on if and when they leave the institution.
- Regular counseling services and therapeutic spaces need to be provided to all children.
- Mental health practitioners ensure that children do not suffer additional victimization through adverse labeling, and that they use empowering, validating vocabulary to refer to the children.
- Sharing and restorative circles are encouraged at institutions to develop relationships between children and to handle interpersonal conflict. 
- Children have adult role models with frequent interaction and mentoring, to ensure consistency in caregiving.
- Children are provided with training on crucial life skills, psychosocial well-being, and understanding of what unhealthy behaviors look like.

  
## Current Reality


### From Literature:

- In a seminar organized by Udayan Care, experts laid out what they see as common pitfalls in institutions that can affect mental health in children
- Rigidity in daily schedules while necessary to establish discipline can often be too restrictive for children to freely express themselves.
- Lack of provisions to accommodate the change in individual rights when children turn older; preventing them from learning to set up independence in their routines.
Inability to get special care and personalized space because of the density of institutions. Individualized care is necessary for trauma informed practices, but it is rare in practice.
Moral codes imposed by the administrative policies of the institutional set-up are often tradition based and sometimes are not in line with progressive childcare practices.
Lack of provisions to accommodate the change in individual rights when children turn older; preventing them from learning to set up independence in their routines.
Provisions for a counselor are often insufficient, social workers/counselors are frequently overburdened with documentation needs and high volume of work. 
Only a limited set of livelihood training programs can be made available – not sufficient to cater to individual future aspirations, specifically for such a diverse vulnerable population as in institutional settings.
Mental health assessments are not regular, nor are they comprehensive, often relying on inputs from other adult caregivers and educators. 
Sharing circles are rare practices and it’s not common for mental health to be discussed outside of poor performance in schools and major behavioral concerns.
Children remain under diagnosed with serious mental illnesses and often do not receive the right medication in time.
In a study conducted by the Ministry of Women and Child Development(MWCD) physical abuse was recorded in 56.73 percent of children in institutions, a major cause of mental health difficulties. 
Existing evidence indicates that early separation from parents is a risk factor for developing a chronic response to traumatic stressors, meaning that an individual would be less able to positively cope with negative stressors that come up in their life.
  

**From the Field:**

  

Confidentiality is not always maintained between staff and counsellors regarding private information that comes up during counselling.

  

Counsellors and social workers are highly overworked and the emphasis of their work often shifts to documentation. 

  

Caregivers are typically not trained to use child-sensitive and trauma-sensitive language around the children.

  

Caregivers struggle to give specialized support to children with disabilities.

  

Children are rarely given the opportunity to engage in open conversations about rules and boundaries with the staff, often resorting to confrontational engagements instead of healthy discussions.

  

Caregiving staff vary widely in their approach towards conversations about children’s parents, and the approach to this can impact children’s connection with their family.

  

Children who are dealing with trauma or requiring support do not always receive one-to-one counselling on a regular basis, nor is medication explored for children with serious mental afflictions.

  

Children are not trained to identify or articulate emotions and often resort to outbursts, violence or self harm.

  

Many children are disinterested in schooling and choose to disengage from all co-curricular activities.

  

**Key Excerpts from Research**

  

  

**From Literature**

  

Some studies have found that violence in residential institutions is six times higher than violence in foster care and that children in group care are almost four times more likely to experience sexual abuse than children in family-based care. (Johnson, 2006)

  

The staff of the institutions can be less aware of individual interests and qualities of children in comparison to a family unit, where every child gets special attention from his/her parent. (Udayan Care, 2014)

  

Facilities for children with disabilities is typically lacking. (Udayan Care, 2014)

  

Many studies are based on infants from Romanian institutions in very specific caregiving environments high in neglect. There is not enough information to allow for the generalization to a belief that all residential care settings across the world must have the same poor caregiving characteristics. (Huynh, 2019)

  

Child psychosocial well-being across “high” and “low” levels of quality of care showed negligible differences between residential- and community-based care settings, suggesting the important factor in child well-being is quality of care rather than setting of care. (Escueta, 2014)

  

The risk of developmental and psychological damage is particularly acute for young children under the age of four, which is a critical period for children to bond with their parents or caregivers. Even in a very well-equipped institution with focused staff, it is unlikely that the attention they would receive from the personnel could replace good parental care at a young age. (IJzendoorn, 2011)

  

As recommended by multiple care providers, teenagers have to be given some freedom to carry out some responsibilities on their own, and boys and girls about to reach 18 have to get permission to spend some time out of the institutions alone. (​​Kobak, 2017)

  

 Where possible, ties can be maintained between children in institutions and their families. Siblings should be kept together in institutions and in cases of adoption. Caregivers should be as constant as possible and, when about to leave their jobs for any reason, they should know how to prepare the children for the transition. (Johnson, 2018)

  

Many children experienced increase loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic. (Loades, 2020)

  

In a paper studying the psychological distress of children in institutional care, it was noted that even if all the socio-economic factors shaping a child’s development and achievement are taken out of the equation, parental involvement during the transition from childhood to adolescence and adulthood remains an important predictor of child’s social well-being. (Saraswat, 2017)

**From the Field**

  

**Routines and rituals**

  

For children in institutions, the daily schedule plays a key role in influencing their mental health and well-being. It’s essential for children to be consistently engaged in interesting, new activities while leaving enough space and time for them to decide what to do. Too much rigidity can lead to mental health struggles while a lack of structure will affect their outcomes and development.

  

**Regular counseling services:** 

  

It’s noteworthy that a majority of institutions do not have a sufficient number of mental health professionals like counselors` or social workers to provide 1:1 or group counselling services to all the children in care. Given that children in institutions typically come from conditions of social deprivation and trauma, this is a major gap.

  

**Regularised interaction with caregivers and adult role models**

  

A great practice in institutions is to schedule time for caregivers to spend time with children in same groups at some point during the day to encourage children to open up about their day, to assure them that they have a caring adult in their lives. This is also regularly achieved in certain institutions through volunteering programs and outreach initiatives. 

  

**Exposure to the outside world**

  

The primary form of exposure at a majority of institutions is to take children out on field trips approximately twice or thrice a year. This lack of exposure limits children in their development of a comprehensive worldview, affecting their integration into society later on.

  

**Pets!**

  

In a couple of institutions, we’ve noticed that pet dogs and cats are raised in the home, to allow children to develop strong bonds with animals, and to improve their mental well-being by spending quality time with their pets, adding joy and happiness to their lives.

**Strained interpersonal relationships** 

  

In institutions, we’ve noticed that peer-to-peer relationships are often challenging because children come from highly different backgrounds, traumatic pasts, and differing cultural contexts. Older children sometimes bully and exert a major influence on younger children. There are smaller groups and cliques that can lead to children being segregated. 

  

**Social integration** 

  

For children in institutions, community integration still remains a fairly challenging prospect. There is stigma and shame associated with an upbringing in an institution, and a lack of exposure outside the home prevents children from accepting their realities while interacting with peers and adults from non-institutional settings. They’re often shy and express fear in being in groups outside the CCI.

  

**Substance abuse** 

  

There are also reports of older children engaging in unhealthy coping mechanisms for stress and anxiety, resorting to alcohol and drug abuse in some cases. This is also worsened by peer pressure, and children in institutions are more vulnerable to negative influences, because of their inability to discern care and concern from exploitation.

  

**Adolescent issues**

  

A universal problem faced by caregivers across all institutions is in dealing with children as they go through changes driven by puberty. Adolescence is a time for developing independence. Typically, adolescents exercise their independence by questioning or challenging and sometimes breaking, rules. It is often difficult for caregivers to differentiate errors of judgment, which are typical and expected of this age group, from a pattern of misbehavior that requires professional intervention.  Stories of heartbreak, unplanned pregnancies, and academic disruptions are somewhat common. 

  

**Caregiver beliefs**

  

In ensuring the psychosocial well-being of children, a crucial component seems to be the attitudes, beliefs, and cultural upbringing of caregivers and mental health professionals at the institution. For instance, caregivers who are able to speak openly about mental health and recognize mental health conditions as legitimate, are able to provide space for children to discuss mental health struggles. Caregiver beliefs drive mental health support offered to children in institutions.
