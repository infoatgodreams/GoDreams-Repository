# Introduction to the Domain

It is essential to keep children’s rights, identity, and safety at the centre of all programs that involve caregiving and child development, for children to grow up into individuals with a strong sense of self, self-sufficient adults There is a global consensus on the need to recognize certain universal rights of all children, particularly children in need of care and protection. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) and similar charters on human rights guide work with vulnerable children. Recognizing the rights of children and holding them sacrosanct recognizes that children are active participants in any caregiving setting and not just beneficiaries of support. 

The following principles of a child-rights-focused approach are based on the UNCRC and expanded in the context of children living in CCIs:
- Children should experience stable attachment with their caregivers in a supportive, loving, community-like environment. 
- Children need access to essential utilities for safe living including nutritious food, clean water, and protection from environmental stressors.
- Children deserve access to quality education, healthy medical care, and opportunities for self-enrichment. 
- Children will not be discriminated against on the basis of gender, sexuality, religion, caste, creed, or family background. 
- Children will be allowed to freely express their views and encouraged to actively contribute to decisions that impact their lives. 
- Children should be allowed to explore and build their own identity and provided opportunities to create a positive self-image and self-esteem. 
- Children learn their rights and responsibilities at the institution, cognizant of the rights guaranteed to them by the state and their responsibilities to make this a safe space for their peers.
- Every child is treated with respect and lives in conditions with sufficient facilities that accord dignity and freedom to their lives. 
- All children will be allowed to practice their faith and spiritual beliefs without any undue influence or coercion
- Every child will receive effective protection from harmful influences, abuse (physical & mental), neglect, corporal punishment, and all forms of exploitation.

## Overview of Child Rights, Safety, and Identity in Child Care Institutions

In the Indian context, in 2015, the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act was passed. All institutions, government or privately run need to be mandatory registered under this Act. The JJ Act outlines the recommended inputs, and monitoring processes applicable to all institutions working with children in need of care and protection, and children in conflict with the law. The Act spans areas of caregiving practices, child protection, child growth, appropriate treatment and integration into the community. The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 was enacted to keep children safe, from contact and non-contact sexual abuse, regardless of their gender. The POCSO Act is applicable to all children.

From observational insights and existing literature, the following are a few factors that influence the safety of children in institutional care:
- Entry and exit procedures must be child-centric. Staff dealing with transitions must be sensitized and trained to ensure children are comfortable and consulted throughout the process. 
- Complex relationships with parents affect the emotional security and psychosocial well-being of children in institutions.
- Physical violence and sexual exploitation are patterns of abuse that emerge in institutions with inadequate monitoring mechanisms. A high proportion of survivors of sexual violence are girls, but boys are also affected.
- Traumatic backgrounds often threaten children’s perception of self, leading to internalized stigma and shame associated with difficult backgrounds. 
- Risks of dangers and injuries rise when children live in insecure or unsafe conditions, driven by improper maintenance and lack of physical infrastructure.
- Religious and spiritual intolerance is sometimes observed when discrimination threatens children’s right to religious expression.

 
## Stakeholders

- In an institution, the primary stakeholders responsible for safeguarding children’s rights and individual identity include the security staff, leadership & child welfare officers, caregivers / house parents, school teachers, donors, volunteers, support staff and the parents of children.
- Leadership and child welfare officers set policies for child rights that are centered on the running of the institution. They also focus on improving protocols pertaining to movement in the institution, children’s social investigation, and maintaining regularised interaction with parents. The leadership also plays a crucial role in allowing for the free expression of children, and in prioritizing the privacy and confidentiality of children.
- Caregivers and house parents have the best vantage point to watch out for signs of abuse, neglect, and bullying. While children engage in daily play, exercise, and in general leisure time, they also closely monitor and keep an eye on the children. 
- School teachers need to pay special attention to children from CCIs, to ensure that they’re safe during school hours. 
- Donors and volunteers who visit institutions need to sign the institutional child protection policy, learn to appropriately interact with children, and undertake the responsibility of protecting every child in the institution.
- Support staff and cleaning staff at the home are trained on the child protection agenda, are adequately informed about child rights, and on modes of proper interaction with children.
- Parents play a key role in building emotional security and emotional safety in children because their presence and interaction offer stability. 
- Security staff is responsible for keeping all children inside the institution safe from external dangers, closely monitoring the entry and exit of other children, visitors and vendors. While external vendors work within the institution, the security ensures that their interactions with children are limited, and informs residential staff and children of appropriate precautionary measures. 

  
# Child Rights, Safety, and Identity Outcomes

## Optimal Adult Outcomes

- Care leavers leave the institution with no adverse impact on developmental trajectories because of negative experiences in the institution.
- Care leavers exhibit a clear understanding of their rights and responsibilities, accorded to them by the state, including relevant schemes and rights to non-discrimination that they can utilize.
- Care leavers are able to discuss their time at the institution openly, to create a community of support aimed at effecting change within their own institutions.
- Care leavers have no long-term unmanageable health conditions tied to neglect at CCIs, that threaten their abilities to work as fully functional members of society.
- Care leavers have a well-developed understanding of personal safety, risks to their well-being, and necessary precautions.
- Care leavers do not repeat patterns of abuse and neglect, and are able to prioritize physical and emotional safety in all relationships. 
- Care leavers are aware of redressal and complaint mechanisms when in danger of harm and abuse, and learn to access the legal system. 
- Care leavers are not discriminated against in the workplace or in educational institutions. 
- Care leavers are not forced into unsafe labor conditions or harmful employment opportunities.
- Care-leavers have no chronic issues arising due to unsafe environment at CCIs that threaten their ability to work as fully functional members of society.

- Care leavers understand and are able to leverage systems around them towards their accessing rights.

  

## Current Reality

### From Literature and from the Field

- Care leavers with a background of traumatic experience in institutions reported difficulties in processing new information and new experiences, and struggling to create social and peer relationships.
- An overwhelming majority of care leavers in India reported little to no understanding of their legal rights, government schemes, and services that they could access as adults. 
- In a study conducted by Harvard Medical School (HMS), the University of Michigan, and Casey Family Programs, care leavers from the foster care system were twice as likely to have a current mental health diagnosis, six times more likely to have PTSD than the general population, and almost four times more likely to have PTSD than veterans of certain wars.
- Many care leavers reported long-term negative emotional impacts as a result of the abuse that they had suffered during their time at the institution. 
- Care leavers are relatively unaware of due processes and rights guaranteed to them by the State. 
- Care leavers often are forced to move to relatively unsafe environments and difficult familial situations once they leave institutions, putting them at higher risk.
- Care leavers do not have access to trauma-sensitive counselling or therapeutic services to deal with past traumatic events.

  
# Child Rights, Safety and Identity Indicators and Inputs

## Optimal Childhood Indicators

- Children are safe and secure where they live, learn and play.
- Children are empowered to participate in their own protection and they are well- aware of the rights they have access to. 
- Children showcase a clear understanding of the due process to follow to highlight any discomfort or potential safety concern.
- Children are able to articulate their problems and suggest solutions; to be actively involved in securing their rights at the institutions. 
- Children freely express their thoughts and sentiments without fear of retaliation from staff and caregivers.
- Children pursue spiritual practices and religious rituals in accordance with their chosen faith without any fear of discrimination. 


## Current Reality

### From Literature and from the Field

- The National Crime Records Bureaurecorded 1,968 crimes in 2019, involving as many as 2,699 child victims in institutional care in India.
- Adolescents exposed to institutional care were significantly more at risk of physical abuse than those in foster care or the general population.
- Children in institutions are also more vulnerable to incidents of sexual assault and sexual abuse, as reported by several indicators across the globe. 
- Children in institutions with experiences of trauma often reported being unable to meet developmental milestones in cognition and social integration. 
- Children in institutions often report an inability to report cases of abuse and violence in the fear of retaliation from other caregivers or peers.
- Children are more accident and injury prone given improper maintenance of playgrounds and gaps in the infrastructure of the institution.
- Corporal punishment as a tool to discipline children is prevalent in institutions. 
- Reports of children with substance addiction disorders and alcohol abuse disorders have been noticed.
- Peer-to-peer violence and bullying have been reported often.
- Children do not report instances of violence and discrimination, worried by the potential consequences of reporting. 
- Children do not recognize their own rights and have little to no understanding of what they are entitled to
- Children sometimes discuss their time at the institution negatively, describing faults in caregiving and the prevalence of violence.
- Children are not always able to avail of supervision for movement outside of the CCI etc. They exhibit lower awareness of potential safety concerns because they’ve rarely been exposed in safe circumstances to the external environment
- The language used by children in describing the CCI can sometimes indicate that the child feels the CCI is not a safe space. 

  
# Suggested Childhood Inputs

_You can find the official recommendations for child safety from the Juvenile Justice Act attached in the annexure of this document_

- The institution needs to be free from chemical, noise, air, and water pollution. 
- The institution needs to be free from hazardous physical structures like broken playground equipment, unprotected wells, open sewers, improper waste disposal mechanism, etc
- The institution should have sufficient space for all children, segregated by age and gender. 
- A stipulated number of toilets and bathrooms need to be provided.
- Privacy of the children must be considered while designing spaces in the institution. Children need to have their own private space that is not open to external visitors at the institution. 
- Children’s committees need to be formed and also be highly participative and active in CCI management. 
- The provision of security guards needs to be in accordance with the number of children and in line with the demands of the JJ Act.
- Children should have an adequate number of beds and rotate bed allocation regularly-weekly or fortnightly.
- Children need to have boxes for anonymous complaints with a clear mechanism to be opened and addressed by the leadership of the institution. 
- Child rights training needs to be organized regularly to inform children of their entitled rights accorded to them.
- Children need access to spiritual services and religious rituals per their interest.
- All relatives and guardians need to sign the register and follow requisite verification protocols before taking the children out of the institution.
- All visitors must be accompanied by staff and a security guard mandatorily.
- Effective caregiving needs to be a combination of setting boundaries and structures and providing autonomy to children.
- Children are encouraged to ask questions about rules and have a discussion on why rules are important. 
- Children are taught critical thinking that allows them to decipher what is right and what is wrong, encouraging the expression of their thoughts and individual identity.
- Caregiver training is needed on modes of disciplining without violence or abuse.
- Children are allowed to have reflective, restorative spaces to discuss abuse and issues in the institution.

## Current Reality

### From Literature and from the Field
- In many institutions, group sizes tend to be large and the caregiver-to-child ratio does not enable individual attention.
- There is a high turnover rate of caregivers at the institution, with caregivers working long shifts and difficult hours, putting children at risk for neglect and emotional abuse. 
- When caregivers perform their caregiving duties, they are likely to focus on immediate logistical needs than sensitivity, or responsiveness to individual children’s emotional needs or exploratory initiatives.
- Children sometimes report being physically hurt, beaten, and abused by staff and report witnessing the abuse of other children by staff within institutions.
- Feedback systems are often infrequent with few anonymous channels or third-party evaluators for input on existing child safety protocols. 
- For children, training on safety is often limited to topics that discuss stranger danger but doesn’t always cover discussions about mechanisms to report challenges within the institution, either with staff or other children in care. 
- Children in institutions are exposed to different adults in the community in the absence of caregivers, during large external events, or commuting to school. This may put smaller children at a higher risk for safety, requiring more vigilant supervision when children are in the presence of non-vetted adults. 
- Background checks for staff are limited in scope and not always procedural, because the staff in institutions come from different parts of the country, often from difficult backgrounds of poverty and strained family situations. 
- Institutions sometimes share private information about the children, including family background, incidents of trauma, and medical information of the children to donors, and this can breach the privacy and confidentiality of children in care.
- In many institutions, children and staff are not always trained in implementable ways on their legal rights, responsibilities, duties, and ways for them to access these constitutional rights. 
- Children are sometimes made to do physical labor and to perform physically demanding tasks of cleaning or repair work at the institution that is unsafe for them, and inappropriate for their age, as a form of disciplining and sometimes as a part of their routine responsibilities.
- In cases of punishment and discipline, it’s been noticed that children may be  taunted and scolded with language that is not always trauma-appropriate or child-sensitive. 
- Child participation in children’s committees and restorative practices is limited and if any, is often driven by compliance requirements. Moreover, the same children are often repeatedly selected for participation and representation in the children’s groups, preventing different voices from being heard. 
- Conversations about sex and gender identities are not commonly encouraged in institutions, limiting children’s awareness of these topics and putting some of them at a greater risk for discrimination.

  

# Key excerpts from Research

## From Literature

- For children in care, the types of vulnerabilities include physical abuse, emotional abuse, neglect, sexual abuse, accidents, and emergencies. (Colton, 2002)
- Child safety needs to be the responsibility of every single adult interacting with children. All adults need to be trained and informed on appropriate communication, child-sensitive behavior, and harmful practices to avoid. (Rainbow Foundation India, 2016)
- Sensitively working with children involves a healthy combination of creating structures, routines, and boundaries while honoring the autonomy of the child. Effective caregiving is a combination of setting boundaries and structures and providing autonomy. Extreme discipline may lead to defiance in children. (Cummings, 2018)
- Child protection committees can be instituted to help enforce prevention measures, improve awareness in the institution, and help coordinate crisis response plans when children are harmed. (Catalysts for Social Action, 2020)
- In an institution, child perpetrators of violence, maltreatment, and abuse need to be treated very sensitively. For example, sexual abuse in the past may cause sexual dysfunction or excessive sexual acting out. Children need trained support from a counselor, and need to be trusted and listened to instead of conversations around guilt and punishment. (Vizard, 2013)
- Privacy and confidentiality: In any external representation of the institution, caregivers need to ensure that the information does not disclose the identity and details such as name, address, locality, school, and a photograph of the child. (Kumar, 2015)

## From the Field

- In older, under-resourced institutions, children can be at a higher risk for accidents and injuries because of under maintained or broken infrastructure in study or play spaces, bathrooms etc
- Child participation in affirming  child rights is limited. In many institutions, children’s committees are functionally inactive, with meetings held primarily for purposes of compliance and documentation. 
- Grievance redressal/feedback systems have many gaps. With functional use of forums like children committees or feedback boxes is rare. 
- Caregivers struggle to implement more progressive disciplinary techniques that keep the child’s rights central. Most caregivers utilize solutions figured out through trial and error and lack any formal training or support on this.
- Conversation at CCIs, while primarily about safety, has slowly started incorporating elements of child participation and empowerment as well. 
- Donors are often  offered unfettered access to the institution, including the physical spaces and confidential  information about children. They are also often allowed to directly interact with children without any training or sensitization.
- Conversations about gender, sex, and caste minorities are limited, and children have difficulties accessing safe spaces to discuss these issues.
- We’ve heard multiple accounts of children in institutions reporting emotional neglect, favoritism, and some struggle with the shame of being placed in an institution. Emotional safety is commonly compromised in under-resourced conditions. 
- Peer abuse is common and widespread in some institutions. While this is recognized as a problem, solutions are complex and difficult to implement.
- Sex education is limited, leaving children vulnerable to exploitation. Digital access provides  children with unfiltered /unvetted sources of information.
