# Introduction

Ensuring that children are and feel safe in the CCI environment emerges as a crucial factor in achieving positive adult outcomes. Studies show that most children in CCIs have had one or more traumatic events in their past, and that children in CCIs are in danger of being physically, emotionally or sexually abused at some point in their childhood. 

# The Gold Standard in Child Safety

## Target Outcomes 

 - Young adults know what to do in situations that put themselves or others around them in danger, are aware of forms of abuse and protections available to them and confident to voice out concerns and seek resolution from competent forums.
- Young adults have few or no symptoms or indicators of past abuse during stay at child care institution. 

## Indicative Outputs

 - Children are not afraid to voice out concerns and highlight red flags if any, as well as work with CCI management to solve them. 
 - Children participate in the decision making at CCIs 
 - Children have  no post-admission clinical indicators of physical abuse, sexual abuse or emotional abuse
 - Children articulate a feeling of safety, their voice being heard, having 1 or more people they can talk to, and have minimal behavioral issues. 
 - Caregivers confident in handling and responding to cases of abuse and child safety violations

# Key Levers at CCIs

Since this domain is a horizontal (an essential part of multiple domains) as well as a vertical (core aspects need to be focussed on independently of other domains), key levers will often intersect with eachother and with other domains. Keeping this in mind, the **emphasis of this domain will be to sustain and build**


> [!info]- Children's Awareness & Rights
> - Children are able to identify cases of abuse and are aware of how to communicate it 
> - Children are aware of safe practices at school, in public spaces and online and have experience practicing them
> - Children know emergency contact numbers and emergency procedures
> - Children are aware of their rights and trained on critical issues such as sexual identity, gender issues, self regulation etc.
> - Children are aware of avenues to participate in decision making that affects them
> - Private spaces available for children along with storage for personal property 

> [!info]- Participatory Structures, policies and alliances
> - Children's committees are set up and consistently participate in decision making on children's affairs
> - Strong relationships must be  built with stakeholders in contact with children and part of the safety process (cwc, social workers, police, school staff, cci staff, parents , lawyers etc)
> - Anonymous feedback structures must be rigorously implemented, including redressal committees, anonymous feedback boxes etc. 
> - Peer-peer alliance built among children
> 
> 

> [!info]- Audits, documentation & assessment
>  - Pre-admission experiences and safety violation documented and access given to essential stakeholders
>  - External safety audit conducted at a fixed frequency
>  - Privacy of documentation held center
>  - CCTV cameras and other safety infrastructure in place
>  - Access to strangers monitored by primary authorities
>  - Background checks conducted on staff and other stakeholders interacting with children
>  - Clear response guidelines for incidents
>  - Clear systems in place and publically known for reporting abuse/safety violations such as anonymmized complaint boxes, redressal committees children's committees etc. 
>  - Documentation compliant with rules and regulations

> [!info]- Training and sensitization of stakeholders
>   - Visitors and other strangers go through a sensitization program before interaction with children
>   - CCI Staff trained rigorously in safety practices and protocols, gender sensitiziation, behavior management (without physical abuse) etc. 
>   - Associated stakeholders such as school teachers, parents etc also undergo sensitization training
>   - Clear code of conduct created, made accessible and communicated to all stakeholders interacting with children

> [!info]- Facilitation of a Safe Environment
> - Separate areas for guests, private spaces for children
> - Restorative circles facilitated on regular basis
> - Conflict resolution systems in place for child-child, child-staff or other conflict
> - Buddy systems during transition periods
> - One point of contact or mentor for reporting, conflict resolution, complaints etc. 


For these levers to work, the **primary challenges and potential opportunities are :** 

> [!bug]- Traditional mindsets towards child safety
> - Mindsets regarding corporal punishment, reporting of abuse, fear of retribution preventing reporting etc. are inherently incentivized in the system and hard to break.
>  
> - Non transparent attitudes  towards external audits will prevent quick upgrades of safety practices
> 
> - Traditional approach (such as language used) towards gender identities, inclusion, children with disabilities, children with learning lags at school etc can often be detrimental to creating a safe environment.

## Literature Review

- Most of the material on child safety concerns itself with reporting guidelines, building awareness in children regarding their own safety and response of the institution to safety violations.
- Current reality of safety issues in CCIs is indicative but not clear possibly due to hesitancy of CCIs in reporting this. 
- Link to the summary of the literature review here [[Child Safety]]

## CCI Immersion
- The Goal of the immersion phase in child safety is to: 
	- Gauge childrens awareness of their rights 
	- Gauge the extent of any violations of child safety norms via sexual, physical or emotional abuse
	- Identify gaps in Knowledge/Skills/Minsets of CCI staff and other stakeholders
	- Identify key challenge areas preventing CCIs from building a safe environment
- The [[Child Safety Immersion]] roll up contains a summary of our learning from CCIs
