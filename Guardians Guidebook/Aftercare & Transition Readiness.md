[[Aftercare]]
# Introduction to the Domain


We know that institutional care forms the bedrock of the system for vulnerable children outside familial care. However, it is also important to recognize that children-in-care need to be properly prepared for independent living, and supported closely during the transition period to adulthood. After the transition, young adults also need access to specific programs that provide a wider safety net for them to grow into fully integrated members of society. 

We need to pay special attention to preparing children who age out of institutions (referred to as ‘Care Leavers’) to ease the transition process and enable their active participation in shaping their own future. 


## Overview of Aftercare Services in Child Care Institutions


In India, aftercare systems are only emerging and are a fairly recent development. Given the relatively new system, there are very few institutions and organizations that offer aftercare services to care leavers, and more pertinently, CCIs are still yet to fully embrace the need for a comprehensive, multi-year, aftercare/transition plan for children. 

In India, The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 and the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Model Rules, 2016 contain legal provisions that make aftercare of children, who have attained the age of eighteen years and are leaving a Child Care Institution, a key area of concern.  However, multiple studies show that the quality of support received by care leavers is not comprehensive and that their journey through the first decade of adult life is often disrupted, unstable, and full of challenges. 


Aftercare is that phase in the life of a young person who is now a Care Leaver (CL) and has transitioned out of care to start the journey toward independent living. While children leave the care of CCIs once they are 18, institutions play a crucial role in preparing them to be able to live independently. This preparation can start as young as age 12, and is critical to ensure successful transitions. 

From observational insights and existing literature, the following are a few factors that influence the quality of aftercare outcomes in institutional care:
- Lack of familial and community support: During the transitional period, it is essential for care leavers to have a community of support that they can lean on to handle difficulties as they adjust to an entirely new way of life. Many care leavers struggle to create such a support system for themselves.
- Lack of resources, manpower, and funding: Since the CCIs primary focus is on providing quality care for children who are living there, there is often a lack of resources and manpower to extend into support for care leavers.
- High turnover rates at institutions make it difficult to create and implement a long-term aftercare transition plan for children. When the primary caregiver of the child leaves, new caregivers lose important history and relationship context with the young adult.



## Stakeholders

In a childcare institution, the primary stakeholders involved in preparing children for transition are the leadership of the institution, caregivers/house parents, aftercare service providers, private career counsellors, school teachers, and previous alumni of the institution. 

- In an institution, the primary responsibility for aftercare planning rests on the **leadership**, i.e the programme director or coordinator at the institution. They’re often responsible for making key decisions regarding continuing educational support to care leavers, creating connections between care leavers and potential care providers or donors, and facilitating the transition of the care leavers into society. This responsibility in certain institutions is taken up by the Child Welfare Officer.
- At an institutional level, the **house parent and caregivers** also play an important role in helping the leadership understand the interests, needs of the child, to help them plan for their future. 
- **Aftercare services providers** can be involved to help care leavers settle in during their transition period. These are typically other civil society organizations, but are sometimes also housed within the same organization that runs the CCI.
- **Private career counsellors and school teachers** are often involved in helping the children and the staff at the institution create a career roadmap for children based on their past performance. This can offer clarity to both care leavers and the leadership in preparing to support their journey forward. 
- **Counsellors and mental health staff** should run workshops and sessions to prepare children for transition, helping them adjust to the idea of a new environment outside the safe haven of the institution.  
- Actively engaged **alumni** can make a huge difference in preparing care leavers because they’re able to share their own experiences, challenges, and pitfalls that their juniors can learn from.

  

# Aftercare Outcomes

## Optimal Adult Outcomes
_These outcome indicators typically describe the long-term success seen in all domains of care leavers_

Throughout this report, outcomes for care leavers have been highlighted across each domain area. Some of these have been mentioned again below:

- Care leavers show stability and continuity in their education, attain graduate education outcomes, and are able to hold on to a job for extended periods of time. 
- Care leavers exhibit positive well-being in physical, mental, and emotional realms.
- Care leavers are able to show empathy, and have the capacity to extend help to other people in need or other vulnerable care leavers in similar circumstances.
- Care leavers establish purposeful, enjoyable careers that help create a feeling of self-worth.
- Care leavers have strong self-esteem and showcase acceptance of their past. 
- Care leavers develop strong relationships from official to informal/social support circles.
- Care leavers develop habits and mindsets that result in the ability to live independently and maintain a career.
- Care leavers integrate into their community actively, participating in regular day-to-day life in their communities, free of any discrimination or stigma. 

  

  

**Current Reality**

  

**From Literature**

  

Based on the most comprehensive study of care leavers in India, we know that 

  

A majority of care leavers face recurring emotional distress and reported that transition had a negative impact on their overall well-being, specifically their psychosocial status. 

  

The transition of care leavers out of care impacted their education in multiple ways, including but not limited to children discontinuing their studies, gaps in enrollment, and disruptive academic performance.

  

Lack of financial literacy has been reported. Care leavers say they were unaware of the true value of the money and were unable to really understand how to spend and save money effectively.

  

Care leavers face pressure to start earning soon after transition and become financially independent. There is a gendered component to this pressure where women are more vulnerable to societal pressures of marriage and family acceptance. 

  

The status of educational outcomes and technical skills picked up by care leavers in institutions is often incongruent with their aspirations and goals. 

  

Care leavers often report that they’re unable to integrate into their college and work communities, feeling a low sense of belonging in any external environment. 

  

  

**From the Field**

  

Care leavers report a lack of confidence in being able to manage outside of the institution.

  

Some care leavers remain at the institution as volunteers or are re-employed. In some cases, this is due to difficulties in transitioning out.

  

Some care leavers articulated an inability to decide on career pathways.

  

Care leavers also articulate feelings of stress and anxiety about leaving the institution.

  

Care leavers are often unable to form or reform relationships with social support systems that exist for them outside of the CCI due to disconnects during their stay at the CCI.

  

Many young adults who transition from care are financially insecure and don’t have savings or starter funds. This influences a lot of their decision-making in the early years.

  

Care leavers who return to their families are quickly forced into work or marriage depending on their gender. Families are found to rarely  encourage care leavers to continue their education. 

  

Care leavers find it difficult to create a network of support or a chosen family once they leave institutions. They report loneliness and a lack of caring adults in their lives. 

  

  

**Aftercare Indicators and Inputs**

  

**Optimal Childhood Indicators**

_These social impact indicators allow us to evaluate the positive aftercare status of children in CCIs_

  

Children in institutions possess all relevant documentation by the time they leave care, including medical records, identity documents, educational records, etc. 

  

All children have individual care plans that clearly capture their growth and development during care.

  

Children are able to apply independent living skills appropriate for their age as they grow up.

  

All children are emotionally prepared for transition with clear access to mental health support during the phase of transition. 

  

Children have adequate academic performance requisite for higher studies or careers.

  

Children who have completed their 12th class should have secured admission in either an educational institution or a job for the first few years after transition.

  

Children are able to apply habits, skills, and mindsets practiced in childhood toward independent decision-making and living. 

  

Children have clearly defined adult mentors/adult support networks that they can reach out to when they need help for 1-1 support. 

  

Children show high levels of socialization, and comfort with the opposite gender and with new people. 

  

Children above the age of 14 are aware of aftercare services, schemes, and scholarships that they can access once they leave care. 

  

  

**Current Reality**

  

**From Literature**

  

Research in India suggests that care leavers do not acquire independent living skills adequately during their time at the institution, leaving them unprepared for life outside the institution. 

  

Acquisition of key skills for independent living including financial literacy, career development, household management, etc is gendered. 

  

A majority of children in institutions are completely unaware of any aftercare services provision, including government schemes for education, health, and well-being.

  

A sizable portion of children in institutions do not continue studying in a stream or academic discipline of their choice while in school, during their time at the institution.

Children often report high levels of stigma and shame, associated with their upbringing at the institution. Self-acceptance is not common. 

  

Many children did not feel empowered since their sense of individual agency had not been developed.

  

  

**From the Field**

  

Children do not have a clear career plan at the end of high school; often showing little to no agency in the decisions they make.

  

Older children are often worried about transition and sometimes haven’t had sufficient opportunities to ask questions or share their concerns.

  

Children show very little acceptance of their past and their upbringing. 

  

Children pick up  habits of smoking and drinking while in school; habits that can increase vulnerability to substance abuse  / addictions in the future.

  

  

**Suggested Childhood Inputs**

_You can find the official recommendations for aftercare from the Juvenile Justice Act attached in the annexure of this document_

  

Children need individualized care and transition readiness plans. This involves having a sufficient number of trained caregivers capable of guiding children during this tumultuous period. 

  

1-on-1 conversations with mentors can play a huge role in influencing the outcomes of this transition phase in children in institutions. 

  

Children and care leavers need to be consulted more actively in decision-making regarding their careers and academic plans, in line with their age and levels of maturity. They need to be actively involved in creating and regularly updating plans for independence. 

  

Where possible families should also be more engaged in transition planning and in understanding alternative living arrangements for children in care. 

  

Children need access to programs that can build relevant skills and knowledge for successful independent living. 

  

Career counseling and support such as coaching classes, exposure visits to colleges or workplaces etc needs to be facilitated for 12-18 year olds.

  

Regular mental health counseling can help children navigate transition years and learn to approach associated emotions positively.

  

Children need supportive, highly-motivated peer groups to encourage them to aim high, and learn from their peers.  

  

  

**Current Reality**

  

**From Literature**

  

Transition out of institutions is often abrupt, with children not being involved in the planning.

  

Many children are not able to regularly talk to a mentor or guide during the transition period.

  

According to a study on care leavers in Delhi, children often report that their time at the institution was insufficient to support their holistic development. 

  

A majority of children in CCIs in Delhi did not receive skill training in cooking and household management respectively while in the institutions.

  

According to a study on care leaver outcomes in India, more than half of the children in institutions receive no one-on-one career preparation or training sessions.

  

  

**From the Field**

  

Children are asked to think about their careers only in 11th and 12th grades when their streams are already chosen for them based on generic academic performance indicators.

  

Career preparation programs are one-off and do not have consistent monitoring or accountability elements to them.

  

Life skills training tends to be value-based/moral education and less emphasis is given to practical skills concerning money, health, safety, and independent living.

  

We’ve observed little to no training on emotionally preparing for a life outside the institution.

  

15-18-year-olds are better prepared for transition at institutions where they are slowly allowed to access public spaces, transportation etc in a safe manner.

  

  

**Key Excerpts from Research**

  

**From Literature**

  

**Global concern for care leavers: ​​** According to a multinational comparison of caregivers, the findings suggest that employment is the main challenge for care-leavers, being reported by all but two of the countries surveyed. Not far behind, education, housing, and poverty were perceived as the main challenges in 31 countries. Isolation or loneliness was observed as a challenge in 29 countries and mental health in 27 countries. Delinquency and substance abuse were reported in 22 countries. (Strahl, 2022)

  

**Lack of reservation:** The schools and colleges do not have a system for reservation of seats for children from institutions (barring Maharashtra) (Udayan Care, 2018)

  

**Lack of tracking:** After the age of 23, there exists practically no record of care leavers and their current status. This is a major gap in the existing system. (Udayan Care, 2019)

  

**Breaks in the aftercare system:** When children move between different states in India, often there is a break in the sponsorship scheme and they lose access to the support that they are guaranteed by the state. (Institute of Social Sciences, 2021)

  

**Global disparity in awareness:** Only 17 countries have enacted legislation specific to aftercare services for children leaving institutional care. (UNICEF, 2015)

  

**Mobility is key:** To learn how to live independently, children leaving institutions must be able to access public transport systems, understand basic civic amenities, and be able to realistically access educational and vocational opportunities. (Catalysts for Social Action, 2020)

  

**Gendered expectations:** Finding accommodation for a small group of single, young women is extremely challenging because of certain patriarchal norms in society. Women who stay alone are often stigmatized and frowned upon. Aftercare services are also discouraged for women who have stricter societal expectations placed on them. (Udayan Care, 2018)

  

**Mental Health:** Access to mental health services, unlike physical health, is much more difficult for most care leavers. Awareness needs to be provided to care leavers on why mental health is important and ways to access support and methods to tackle stigma and discrimination that they’re likely to face outside of the institution. (Lamont, 2009) 

  

**Regular follow-up:** Every childcare institution must prepare and implement a post-release follow-up plan for the young person and shall conduct regular follow-up programs and maintain regular contact for all released children to ensure they do not get back into a difficult situation. (Atkinson, 2019)

**From the Field**

  

**Children continue working in institutions:** Care leavers who are not able to live independently sometimes continue working at the CCI itself. Several of these young adults articulated that this is a transitionary arrangement, while a few have been integrated permanently into staff.

  

**Participatory decision making:** Young adults who have to make career choices often have limited clarity or control over these choices as constraints such as finances, mentorship, exposure etc play a dominating role in influencing these decisions.

  

**Care leavers struggle with assimilation:** From multiple reports in institutions, we know that care leavers find it difficult to form peer groups in colleges and workplaces.  Some of the articulated challenges have been lack of common topics to talk about due to under-exposure, stigma about their background, language barriers, social soft skills etc.

  

**Care leavers are often stigmatized in society:** Care leavers commonly report accounts of being treated differently or a feeling of being ‘othered’ in peer groups where their background and time in care is known. There is a tendency to hide or associate upbringing in Children’s Homes with shame or negative emotions.

  

**Care leavers struggle with long-term health concerns:** Care leavers with chronic heath issues remain dependent on institutions for continued support even post transition, in terms of financing or access to doctors & medicines. Mental health support often drops completely post transition due to societal stigmas. 

  

**Struggles to create bonds with family:** Care leavers often go back to or seek out family after leaving the CCI. There is often a struggle to form relationships with them, if this relationship has not been continuously cultivated or legally/logistically feasible during the stay at the CCI. Given that these relationships are weak and haven’t been nurtured over the years, they don’t often get along with their family members / next of kin  and are neglected. 

  

**Familial pressure** is common in cases of care-leavers who retain contact. Care leavers are expected to immediately find a job or get married. Girls often have to drop out of education early.

  

**Lack of career options:** In most institutions, there are limited choices that are offered to children due to financial constraints or lack of exposure.  Already limited choices due to difficulty paying fees are further reduced by academic achievement gaps. This problem is exacerbated by the lack of exposure that children have to different career paths. They are typically exposed indirectly to certain pathways more than others through interactions with school stakeholders, volunteers, donors, etc. Career counseling typically starts only in high school, if available.
