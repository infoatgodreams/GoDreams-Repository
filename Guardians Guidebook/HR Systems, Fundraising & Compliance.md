**Fundraising & Expenditure** 

  

**Costs Associated with Running an Institution**

  

For a majority of institutions, the primary headers of expenditure include rent, salaries, facilities & maintenance, education, healthcare, personal and facility hygiene, groceries & food items, miscellaneous expenses for children in care.

**Findings on expenditure patterns in institutions:** 

  

On average, the per child cost to an institution is around INR 5,000 on a monthly basis, leading to an annual expenditure of close to INR 60,000 per child for a typical institution.

  

Across a majority of institutions, over a third of expenditure is on staff salaries. Caregivers and support staff are typically paid in a range of INR 5000 - INR 10000 on a monthly basis. It is noticed that Accountants are often paid the highest salaries, more than the Coordinators and Child Welfare Officers. 

  

Groceries and snacks for children are also a major expenditure for CCIs. Across institutions, there is a preference for bulk grains because they tend to be less expensive than fresh fruits and vegetables. This cost difference does tend to impact nutritional practices at institutions, affecting the diversity of food for children in care. Typically, food is the most donor-friendly component of expenditure and can attract in-kind donations for raw materials or cash donations for meal sponsorship. 

  

Educational expenses vary widely across Institutions based on the type of school that children are sent to. Private schools, even low-income private schools have significant budget implications because of the number of children in care. Some institutions make this decision based on access to donors willing to sponsor educational expenses for children. 

  

Spends on personal hygiene items and other cleaning / maintenance items tends to be lower. This could be due to bulk purchases of items at discounts, contributions by donors or de-prioritization as an expense to minimize. However, this decision has implications on children’s health outcomes, as sharing of personal hygiene items can spread infections. 

  

Broad health expenses tend to be minimal because institutions make use of partnerships and charitable initiatives offered by hospitals and medical professionals willing to provide pro-bono health services. While this is an excellent model of community support, in some cases, the quality and continuity of health support for children might be affected due to frequent changes in service providers. Typically, elective procedures, hospital stays, and medical aids are not covered under these pro-bono services. 

  

In a majority of institutions, extracurricular activities and additional tutoring are pro-bono services that are offered by volunteers from the community or other non-profit organizations keen on supporting children in care. In the absence of a paid partnership, in some cases, accountability can be affected, with children receiving irregular support. However, many institutions do not have the budget currently to afford trained tutors and guides for after-school support and effective engagement. 

  

Donors also often donate used clothes, toys, and books to the institution, allowing institutions to spend minimally on these items. What’s often missing though is clear information about the exact needs and wants of children in care, and this can reduce the CCIs ability to effectively use donated items. 

  

  

**Fundraising channels in institutions:**

  

Walk-in donations: For a majority of institutions, walk-in donors constitute a major chunk of support for the institution’s daily operations. Walk-in donors are typically donors from the community looking to contribute small amounts for children in care, for special occasions of birthdays, anniversaries, and other celebrations. Walk-in donors either offer direct cash donations or sponsor meals for children. In cities, donations through UPI have greatly increased the ease of walk-in donations for institutions. 

  

Online donation: An online donation page is usually linked to the website of the institution to encourage online donations through payment portals or through direct bank transfers to the institution. Online fundraising allows donors to give quickly, easily, and securely, breaking geographical barriers. However, most institutions lack the technical know-how and marketing expertise to run and coordinate social media campaigns and avoid using crowdfunding platforms online.  

  

International giving: Only charitable institutions registered under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act are allowed to directly access funding from outside the country. Often, institutions, if registered under the FCRA rely on only one or two regular international patrons. Some well-run institutions have donor management teams and fundraising professionals capable of building sustainable relationships with many donors globally. 

  

Corporate Social Responsibility and Foundations: From our conversations with the leadership team of institutions, only a few receive regular funding from large corporations and non-profit foundations. A barrier to accessing this funding is the lack of bandwidth and talent to create extensive proposals, presentations, and reporting documents that are required from donors. 

  

Parent organizations: Some institutions rely on parent organizations and support from religious institutions that handle fundraising and fund allocation for them. This is mostly seen in chain institutions that operate under the same banner as a parent organization. 

  

Government funding, while available to some institutions, varies according to state regulations and practices. Not all institutions registered with the JJ Act are automatically eligible for financial support from the government. In some cases, institutions are expected to file additional proposals for accessing financial aid. 

  

Some CCIs do bulk cold calls to seek out new donors while others do outreach and awareness campaigns at events and in communities. Donors are typically engaged via Whatsapp groups, and in few cases, via email. 

  

  

**Donor Behaviours and Motivations:**

  

For most individual donors, trust is a key element in their relationship with the institution. Many donors require documentation that can prove the existence and proper functioning of the institution, prior to making a donation to the organization. Some donors prefer  visiting the institution and talking to the children to assuage their concerns about reliability. For many donors in the community, donating in-kind is preferred, because they’re able to control where their donations are used. 

  

In our conversations with the staff and leadership at the institution, another key element in maintaining donor satisfaction is regular descriptive communication. Using Whatsapp and E-mail, many institutions write to donors regularly to inform them of how their donations have been spent, along with regular pictures from the institution. In some cases, caregivers and staff also provide personal medical information and background stories of children to donors, to convince them of institutional needs. However, care needs to be taken to keep the child’s privacy central. 

  

For donors that visit the CCI regularly, child interaction and engagement seem to be crucial to maintaining and growing donor relationships with the institution. When donors visit the CCI, there is often a heavy influence on children’s schedules and activities, because interaction convinces donors to continue their support. 

  

In some of our conversations with the staff, it has also become clear that donors prefer regularly engaging with institutions when they find that children in care are well-behaved, highly social, and open to conversations. It is imperative that donors leave with a good impression of the management and functioning of the institution. 

  

In some cases, given that the sustainability of institutions is closely linked with the support of individual donors, the staff may struggle to draw boundaries with donors about accepted protocols and behaviours at the institution. 

  

  

**Challenges in existing models of fundraising within institutions:**

  

For many institutions, access to funding from foundations and large corporates is difficult, because of challenges in bandwidth and expertise needed to meet official reporting requirements. This is also true for accessing government aid, where documentation requirements are stringent, and institutions need trained social workers and experienced finance professionals to help put together requisite documents. 

  

For a majority of institutions, a lack of certainty in the amount of funding and the regularity of funding prevents the leadership from being able to plan well-head for sustainability. CCIs typically run on a month to month basis and do not have a large emergency fund for sudden expenses .

  

  

  

**HR Systems & Organizational Structure**

  

For a well-functioning CCI, it becomes imperative to not only have a good staff to child ratio but also for the leadership to focus on recruitment strategies, comprehensive induction programs and regular training to re-emphasize and update practices at the home

  

For children in care, typical staffing patterns and responsibilities include:

  

**Leadership and management:** 

  

Project directors focus on bringing together different functions and staff responsibilities at the institution. They’re responsible for creating structures, systems, and processes to streamline operations, across a range of functions, including finances, fundraising, caregiving, and compliance. They’re responsible for the overall well-being of children in care and the staff in employment. 

  

Allocation of funds raised across departments and functions is primarily determined by management. 

  

In most institutions, the leadership is also responsible for fundraising and donor communications, coordinating with donors about regular donor visits, organizing community raising drives, and providing regular updates to donors. 

  

  

**House parents and primary caregivers:** 

  

Caregiving and child care involve the core caregiving function at the institution, responsible for cultivating an environment of care and attention for children.

  

Positive caregiver-children interactions are an essential part of building more resilient and happy children. Older children who receive positive interactions from caregivers also exhibit higher self-esteem, better performance in school, and a lower risk of negative outcomes such as depression or drug use later in life.

  

House parents provide the day-to-day supplies for children, including clothing, and toiletries.

  

For small children, house parents also take on additional responsibilities of helping the children bathe, and washing their clothes.

  

House parents are largely responsible for maintaining discipline among their children, and ensuring that they follow all the activities in their routines.

  

For children, their house parents are their primary caretakers and they often need to spend enough time with them to build a safe, trusting relationship. 

  

House parents are also the first respondents when children are sick, or if they’re going through periods of emotional distress and angst. They should be perceptive of the smallest changes in their children’s behaviors. 

  

  

**Superintendent and Child Welfare Officer:** 

  

The Child Welfare Officer is required to maintain the case files and medical files of all children in care.

  

The Child Welfare Officer is also usually responsible for delegating caregiving duties to different house parents and helps in monitoring the progress of all the caregiving staff. 

  

They also participate in the orientation and monitoring of the education, vocational and mental health programs in the institution, including attending parent-teacher meetings on behalf of the child at school. 

  

Child Welfare Officer also helps in creating the Social Investigation Report of the child and maintains contact with children when they’re on a summer break, or during visits to their homes of origin. They also conduct field visits to the homes of children to ensure that they are safe spaces for children to spend time in. 

  

The Child Welfare Officer is also responsible for producing the child to the Child Welfare Committee meetings when required, and for keeping all the identity documents of the child safe, and in order. 

  

**Accountant and Finance in-charge:**

  

The accountant is responsible for maintaining records of cash inflows and outflows, and for arranging the book of accounts for annual audits, and inspections.

  

The accountant also sets in place the mechanism for providing receipts of donations to donors and working with the government to avail 80G, and 12A certifications for the institutions. 

  

The accountant maintains a clear record of expenditures for the organization across different headers and helps the leadership create annual expense reports. 

  

  

**Mental Health Staff:**

  

The mental health staff in an institution assume the responsibility to work on the psychosocial well-being indicators for all children in care. 

  

Often a trained psychologist or social work graduate, the mental health staff works on creating a rehabilitation plan for all children in institutions that require mental health support. 

  

The mental health staff also helps the child welfare officer in updating the Individual Care Plan of each and every child in the institution every three months, by closely monitoring their progress during structured 1-1 sessions or during the unstructured time of play and leisure. 

  

For children with more difficulties, including psychiatric illnesses, the mental health staff can refer children to external support, through other trained psychologists or psychiatrists, when necessary. 

  

  

**Medical Officer/ Paramedical Staff:**

  

In many institutions, the child welfare officer, or any of the house parents with a background in allied health sciences or nursing assumes the role of a medical officer in the institution. 

  

The medical officer and medical staff focus on the physical well-being of children in care, helping treat injuries, and infections, managing long-term care of chronic conditions, and escalating conditions to external medical help, if necessary. 

  

They’re also responsible for maintaining the sick room/isolation room in the institution, along with a stock of medicines that are regularly refilled.

Children are only allowed to take medicines if prescribed by and provided by qualified medical staff in the institution. 

  

  

**Support Staff:**

  

The kitchen staff, including cooks, manage the end-to-end nutritional practices of the institution, including helping create meal plans and grocery shopping lists. 

  

Cleaners, either part-time or full-time keep the premises of the institution clean, including regular cleaning of toilets, bathrooms, and floors to keep the environment hygienic and clean for children to live in. 

  

Drivers often help children commute to and from school, and are responsible for the safety of children while in transit. Owning a vehicle, and hiring a driver also allows for children to make hospital visits, extracurricular classes, and educational visits, under the supervision of staff at the institution. They often take on the role of purchasing grocery and handle some logistics. 

  

  

**Additional tutors & Volunteers:**

  

Volunteers are typically engaged for academic support and extra curricular activities. 

  

Donors sometimes spend time at the institution, either for one time events, or as volunteers themselves.

  

Corporates sometimes conduct CSR activities at institutions. 

  

  

**Challenges in people management in institutions:**

  

Recruitment is often a big challenge for institutions, because of a lack of organized and trained caregivers available for hire in the sector. Caregivers have little time off and the role tends to be residential. It’s not always easy to identify qualified, highly-interested caregivers who are willing to stay away from their families, to live full-time in the institution. 

  

Long working hours are part of the job description when working in a CCI. Staff, particularly the residential staff shoulder a big responsibility of keeping children safe around the clock. Often, residential staff ends up being present around the children for 80-100 hours every week, and on average, will be responsible for caring for at least 15-20 children. Caregivers may need to cope with challenging behavior, high levels of noise, administrative workload, and repetitive stressors.  

  

Background checks in institutions are sometimes not thorough due to logistical difficulties and lack of facilities for verification. Staff often migrate and do not have consistent work records. 

  

Personal space for staff is limited in most CCIs, since most infrastructural decisions have to be made to maximize available space for children on priority. This may not be optimal for concerns of privacy, and to ensure that the staff has their own space and time to unwind and refresh at the end of every day.  

  

Lack of career growth opportunities is a commonly observed concern for caregiving staff and for administrative staff at the institution. Staff often draw a minimal salary with very few increases over many years. They are primarily influenced by the provision of free education and accommodation for their children, but this doesn’t always provide incentives for upskilling or role growth. 

  

Lack of education and hard skills: In institutions, given continuous bandwidth crunches, the leadership has to sometimes hire under qualified and under trained staff for different roles in the institution. The presence of a significant number of adults is not negotiable when there are so many children in care.  

  

There is an emotional toll associated with working in CCI. Staff and caregivers are continuously exposed to children that come from varied backgrounds of neglect, trauma, and abuse. Caregivers are expected to provide a safe space and listen to the troubles and challenges of their children, but there is a psychological toll to being around and listening to these difficult conversations. Staff do not always have access to mental health support. 

  

  

**Some Best Practices in CCIs**

  

A clear HR policy with well-defined holidays, codes of conduct, working conditions, compensation and benefits, and health and safety considerations would allow for the staff at CCIs to clearly understand the roles and responsibilities that they’re signing up, clarifying expectations from the management. 

  

Role clarity: For staff at CCIs, given that their responsibilities are overlapping and interdependent, it would be helpful to create clarity about each staff’s primary responsibilities, their deliverables, and their managers to whom they can reach out for support and advice. 

  

Induction and training: It is essential that all the staff at the CCI thoroughly understand the work that they do, and the larger mission of the organization. This alignment of staff with the organization’s values, and vision would allow for the staff to contextualize their day-to-day caregiving responsibilities with a larger sense of purpose. Regular training is also essential to bring clarity to core principles of the organization and to address key gaps in their skills. 

  

Planning and review: Regular planning that allows for the staff to share, inform, question, and reflect would encourage the staff to quickly bring up issues and get them resolved.  

  

Meetings and facetime: Frequent cross functional meetings between staff, management and children can increase accountability and transparency, and provide a support system for staff. In observed CCIs where these structures were present, staff were happier and showed less signs of burn out. 

  

Personal upskilling and growth opportunities can encourage staff in CCIs to build on skills relevant to their interests. This can include additional teaching certifications, computer-IT skills, or picking up the technical skills for TALLY or other finance programs.  

  

Monitoring and evaluation done on a regular basis can mark milestones for progress towards select goals for all the staff members in the CCI. These metrics allow for the staff to assess their performance, and make small adjustments and improvements that can influence the quality of care and their own satisfaction in their role. 

  

Support from leadership and the upper management, especially through a coordinated grievance redressal process can help alleviate safety concerns and ensure fair treatment, resolving key issues. 

  

Recognition and regular appraisals can reward good performance, specifically expertise, energy, time, effort, and additional initiative. These rewards can motivate and encourage regular improvements in caregiver and staff performance. 

  

Salaries and benefits need to be commensurate with the skills, talents, and competencies. A compensation structure should be designed to incentivize institutional staff to join and stay in the organization. 

  

Personal time and self-care: The staff in CCIs need time and space for recreation, relaxation, and time to unwind. It is important to encourage caregivers to prioritize their own health so that they can continue to enjoy work and take care of children. 

  

Shift systems can be incorporated to ensure staff that are on duty are alert and professional at all times. Rather than have caregivers who stay at the CCI 24/7, night shifts, breaks and multi role rotations can be incorporated to ensure staff are well rested.

**Institutional Compliance**

  

For all childcare institutions in India that house children in need of care and protection, there exists a legal framework to protect children’s rights and provide legislative safeguards, in line with the objectives of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Children. 

  

Following are the relevant laws and statutes that apply to children growing up in childcare institutions: 

  

**The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015:** This Act is concerned with children in conflict with the law and children in need of care and protection. It prescribes protocols for institutional care for children through shelter homes, children’s homes, etc., and non-institutional care through foster care, adoption, sponsorships, and after-care organizations. All childcare institutions are mandated to be registered with the JJ Act.

  

**The Orphanages and Other Charitable Homes (Supervision and Control) Act, 1960** preceded the JJ Act in governing the functioning of orphanages. This Act empowers the state governments to monitor and supervise orphanages or child care institutions and create a Board of Control for this purpose. 

  

**The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956:** This Act criminalizes prostitution and trafficking, particularly the keeping of certain premises as brothels and living on the income earned through prostitution, though it doesn’t criminalize prostitution done independently and voluntarily. This Act is relevant as it protects children in need of care and protection from trafficking and prostitution. 

  

**The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009:** According to Article 21-A of the Indian Constitution, it is a fundamental right of every child from the age of six to fourteen, to receive free education. This Act guarantees the protection of that right and allocates responsibilities to the governments at different levels. 

  

**The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986:** This Act was enacted to give effect to the Constitutional provision enshrined in Article 24. According to Article 24 of the Indian Constitution, every child below the age of fourteen has the right to be protected from any sort of hazardous employment. It was enacted on the basis of Article 39(e), which empowers the state to make policies that protect children from forced employment that is not suitable for their age and skills. If any childcare institution subjects orphans to any form of labour, a strict penalty will be imposed. 

  

**The POCSO Act, 2012:** The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 was enacted to protect children from all forms of sexual abuse, regardless of their gender. The Act prescribes strict punishments for those who subject children to any kind of sexual harassment. This Act protects children in need of care and protection who are vulnerable to sexual exploitation. 

  

**The Orphan Child (Provision for Social Security) Bill:** The Orphan Child ( Provision for Social Security ) Bill was introduced in Lok Sabha in 2016. However, the bill has not been passed yet. It contains many provisions that were formulated with the intention of securing the welfare of orphan children. The following are the provisions formulated in the Bill: 

  

- According to Section 3, the central government has to conduct surveys on orphan children every ten years. 

  

- Section 4 provides for a national policy for the welfare of orphans to be formulated. 

  

- Section 6 states that the central government shall constitute a fund for the purpose.

  

- Section 8 provides for the establishment of foster care homes. 

  

**The Information and Technology Act of 2000**, codifies the provisions against child pornography. Anyone who produces distributes, or causes to be published or transmitted any digital content portraying minors engaging in explicit sexual acts or behavior, would be held as a criminal by law and would face serious consequences.

  

Besides these acts, the Indian government also issued various welfare schemes for destitute children. The Child Protection Services (CPS), is a scheme launched by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, which aims to support and provide for these children in need. 

  

**Child Welfare Committee:** 

  

- For the Children in need and care of protection, State Government may, by notification in Official Gazette, constitute for every district or group of districts, specified in the notification, one or more Child Welfare Committees for exercising the powers in relation to the child in need of care and protection under this Act.

  

- The Committee shall consist of a Chairperson and four other members, of whom at least one shall be a woman and another, an expert on matters concerning children. The Committee shall function as a Bench of Magistrates.

  

- A child in need of care and protection is produced before CWC for being placed in safety. The Committee has the final authority to dispose of cases for the care, protection, treatment, development, and rehabilitation of the children as well as to provide for their basic needs and protection of human rights.

  

  

**Statutory and legal requirements for institutions**

  

There are some government-defined regulations that need to be met by all registered institutions operating actively across the country. Many of these registered institutions receive support from the government that can only be accessed if the institution is compliant with expected regulatory processes. These compliances are also essential to avoid any penalties or prosecutions. 

  

**Not-for-profit organizations (NPOs)** in India generally take three legal forms: trusts, societies, and limited (Section 8) not-for-profit companies. Typically, childcare institutions are registered as trusts or societies. This registration is mandatory and often involves the creation of a governing body, and regular audits of company accounts. 

  

**12A registration** is a one-time registration that is granted by the Income Tax Department to trusts and other not-for-profit organizations. The purpose of the registration is for tax expemptions.

  

An **80G Certificate** in India is a legal document granted by the Income Tax Department to a charitable trust. The 80G Certificate is issued to encourage and promote the donors to contribute funds because their donations are now eligible for a tax exemption of 50%  and also they become qualified to deduct the donation amount from their Gross Total Income.

  

**Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010:** Broadly, the FCRA requires every person or NGO seeking to receive foreign donations to be 

  

- registered under the Act

  

- to open a bank account for the receipt of the foreign funds in the State Bank of India, Delhi

  

- to utilize those funds only for the purpose for which they have been received and as stipulated in the Act.

  

- They are also required to file annual returns, and they must not transfer the funds to another NGO.

  

**Building Stability License:** The issuance of a Public Building License is used for availing the benefits from the state government. It is expected for organizations to renew their license every five years. 

  

**Fire Safety License:** In India, a fire license or no-objection certificate is a mandatory document to obtain building plan approval from the Local Municipal Authority. Fire licenses need to be renewed every year.
