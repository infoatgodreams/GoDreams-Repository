[[Family Restoration & Alternative Care]]

# Introduction to the Domain
While CCIs serve as the final safety net for children in need of care and protection, the UN Guidelines on Alternative Care of Children suggest that children in institutional care should live in a family-based environment, when it is in their best interests for them to do so. 
This is achieved through family restoration, placement in a foster family, or legal adoption. Several countries have restructured existing childcare systems to include these alternate care models in conjunction with childcare institutions. 

The following explains the list of options available in alternative care for children in institutions:
- **Permanent reintegration** into their original home, family, and community, for all purposes of care and protection.
- **Adoption** is defined as the permanent placement of a child in a family, following which the rights and duties of biological parents are legally transitioned to the adoptive parent/s.
- Fostered in care by **kinship** is the most common, informal arrangement of alternate care worldwide. It is typically managed without formal legal intervention. Kinship care often allows existing familial bonds to develop, keeps the children within their culture and community, and avoids the challenges associated with children being placed with unfamiliar families. However, informality of kinship care has associated risks due to its lack of documentation and monitoring. Families experiencing deep poverty may find that caring for an additional child is not possible or extremely difficult. 
- **Fostered in care** by a non-family member, can play an important role in a situation where a child’s own family is unable to temporarily care for their child. Placement in foster care is typically short-term in nature, and foster carers generally receive assistance to meet the child’s needs which may include training, guidance, and financial assistance from the government.  Unlike adoption, a child in foster care remains the legal responsibility of the State and the biological parents.

## Overview of Restoration in Child Care Institutions

Given that the financial health and safety of families of origin from low-income communities can be turbulent, the decision to restore children from institutions, back with their families needs to be carefully considered, and a multi-step preparatory process is necessary to act in the best interests of the child. In India, this process is laid out in the JJ Act for restoration of a child with the family and it is extensive, including the assessment of the family’s current capabilities to provide for the child, preparing a care plan for the child, and following up on how the child is doing post-reintegration with their families.  Nascent research emerging from African countries has shown that children from institutions restored in their families can sometimes experience a number of challenges, including threats to their physical safety, inadequate living conditions, educational disruption, and stigma. 

  From observational insights and existing literature, the following are a few factors that influence the quality of restoration outcomes in institutional care:

- **Variation** in quality of care in families poses a challenge to institutions because standardization of protocols is harder when the backgrounds of families, socioeconomic contexts, and environments tend to vary widely. Care needs to be stable and supportive, and assessing care is often complex and time-consuming. 
- **Parents & Family Resources:** As in many aspects of child development, the educational status of parents, family income, family structure, and access to resources can influence the outcomes of children being restored into families. In India, low-income families sometimes struggle to provide essential resources to children, putting them at higher risk of poor developmental outcomes. 
- **Under-resourced institutions** without trained staff for restoration do not often have the bandwidth for the preparation of children, families, and communities to encourage reintegration. Each child’s case requires a customized approach, and institutions need to invest significant resources into restoration. 
- **Systemic capacity issues** in the childcare sector make restoration a difficult undertaking at scale because of its individualized and customized nature.


## Stakeholders

- In institutions, the attitudes and processes set in place for encouraging familial relationships and potential restoration are dependent on the beliefs of the leadership. The leadership also set the messaging for how staff discusses parents and families with children in care. Often, the number of calls to parents and family visits are pre-determined by the leadership too.
- Caseworkers and social workers in institutions have the day-to-day responsibility to communicate with and follow up with families of children in institutions. They create context about the background of the family, safety risks for when children visit their families and help prepare families for their children visiting them or in cases of reintegration. They act as the link between the institution and the children. Social workers are also expected to do home visits and social investigations for children in care.
- Children and families have somewhat strained relationships, leading to complex issues of trauma and attachment. Mental health staff need to be trained to help children navigate these emotions without any disruption to their daily lives and any behavioral difficulties. 
- The family and parents play an important role in the lives of their children, mainly influenced by their involvement in their children’s lives. Families ideally need to keep in touch with the children, offering support and emotional security in their relationships. Their continuous involvement can also make transitions easier, when children leave institutions or if they are ready to be restored to their families.
- The role of the community is in accepting children from institutions back into their families, encouraging them to be a part of the community’s activities, rituals, and events. Sometimes, the mindsets and beliefs of neighbors, peers, and members of the community can stigmatize children returning from institutions, affecting post-restoration outcomes. Thus the community needs to be prepared/sensitized too. 


# Family Restoration Practices and Outcomes

## Preparing Children for Restoration

For children in institutions to move back to their families of origin or to family-based care, it is a complex transition period because any change in a primary caregiver is difficult for children to process. Comprehensive planning and regular visitation must be a part of the process to improve outcomes of restoration and to help children feel confident about this change. 


### Optimal Practices for Preparing Children for Restoration

- Each child needs a separate care plan that details the plan for reintegration, if any, that is customized to their background and needs. 
- Communication is key. Caregivers need to inform children honestly about the process and this honesty helps them trust every step of the process.
- Child identity and sense of self need to be maintained throughout the process. 
- Focussing on attachment and consciously transferring attachment from the caregiver to the family is essential.
- Children need to maintain previous friendships and relationships with the staff and children at the institution.
- The institution should provide information about the possible timelines associated with the transition and explain the reasons for restoration in a child-friendly way to ease some of the anxieties associated with this change.
- Space for children to discuss their views, hopes, hesitations, and anger needs to be provided.
- Caregivers should remain positive throughout the process because their attitudes can influence the way a child views this change.
- Children should remain in institutional care for as long as is needed to prepare them for reintegration or, where this is not possible, to find them a new permanent family.
- Caregivers need to engage children in culturally appropriate daily responsibilities and decisions, such as cooking and cleaning, determining recreational activities, or having some input in the daily schedule.
- Caregivers need to focus on building children’s capacity to act autonomously and provide opportunities to express emotions freely.
- Children have an atmosphere conducive to healing and rehabilitation with their families, in the safe space of the institution. Trained counselors can help children learn to trust their families and parents in a familiar setting. 
- Children should not be moved abruptly and without warning. 
- Children are taught coping skills and independent living skills to prepare them for a life outside the institution.
 

### Risks associated with poor preparation of children for restoration:

- Children might be forced to give up relationships that they have created over many years, and this can affect their social skills in the long-term.
- Some children stay afraid and insecure post restoration because they continue to be worried about sudden, abrupt changes in the environment.
- Some children might begin to believe that their interests, wishes, and feelings are not important because they were not consulted with or listened to during the restoration process. 
- Many children do not have faith and trust in their families, and they could potentially struggle to adjust to their new environments and new caregivers. 
- Some children might lose a sense of who they are because their identity formation was interrupted, and they may now find it challenging to identify new life patterns that fit well, including their careers and social relationships.


## Current Reality

### From Literature and from the Field
- For a majority of children, we observed that the individual care plan and the aftercare plans do not focus on family integration and restoration. 
- Research from Udayan Care suggests that essential counseling and emotional support to prepare children for this major change are provided only to some children before restoration, inadequately preparing them for a new life. 
- Research on deinstitutionalisation in India also suggests that active, ongoing consent is not always taken from children. Their agency to say no to the process is limited. 
- We’ve observed that some parents and family members do not visit children regularly in the institutions, despite provisions that exist for phone calls and monthly visits. They do not always have sufficient context to the children’s evolving personalities which can sometimes result in children A home visit and family study are sometimes not conducted for children in the process of restoration. This points to a gap in the preparation process. 
- In many institutions, the attitudes of staff towards parents are not conducive to positive relationships of children with their families. Conversations with some staff included them voicing their disregard of  parents as active stakeholders in the lives of children. 
- Some children who returned to the CCI from their homes reported poorer conditions of living and safety, relative to their conditions at the institution. 


## Preparing Families for restoration


## Optimal practices for preparing families for restoration

- Parents/family members who have not maintained visits/contact have a low degree of knowledge about children and their daily activities and will require more guidance and support from caregivers in learning about their children. 
- Families need to learn about the emotional side of transition, including conversations about how different family members feel about this change and the impact of the child’s entry on existing relationships in the families.
- Families need to be informed about community services, non-profit organizations, and government support that they can access to better take care of their children. 
- Children with special needs, including physical, mental, and learning difficulties need more care and families need to be guided on techniques to support them. 
- Parents need to know that it will be important for the child to maintain their self-identity as they move into their new home. 
- A proper assessment of the family’s environment and potential risk factors that affect the safety and well-being of the child needs to be done by staff at the institution.
- Families should be prepared to change their practices and their beliefs about the child, if needed. 
- Families need to be provided with a clear understanding of the economic and logistical implications of taking the child in, to understand if their cause for separation has changed. 

### Current Reality
  
### From Literature and from the Field

- According to existing research on family restoration in an institution, we’ve learned that children are sometimes restored to familial settings with risk factors that were prevalent in the first place when the child was placed in the institution. 
- The existence of stability and harmony in the family is an important risk indicator to consider prior to restoration. Unfortunately, this assessment is often not done prior to restoring children to institutions.
- We’ve noticed that institutions do not typically have the resources or independent bandwidth to work with parents on improving their caregiving practices.
- Parents and families are sometimes not included in key decisions that concern the child, reducing the likelihood of their continued role and influence on child’s outcomes at the institution. 
- We’ve heard accounts of some children struggling with adapting to parents that have remarried and moved to new homes. They’re more vulnerable to being discriminated against in these new settings. 
- Parents and families can sometimes afford to only take care of a single child, and this could lead to siblings being separated from each other, an outcome that’s undesirable for children.
- We’ve noticed that when it comes to some girls in institutions, parents can sometimes act against the best interests of the children because of existing beliefs and prejudices. 

  
# Mapping the Needs of Children Post-Restoration
  

## Shelter and Safety

- Assuring children’s physical and emotional safety in non-institutional settings like families is a key step in restoration. 
- Among other things, the social investigation should consider the background of the family, understand cultural practices, if any, that could make the child vulnerable to exploitation, seek information about the family’s financial health, and try to understand if the family, in any way, seeks to benefit from the child’s exploitation. 
- Apart from these subtle indicators, it is also important to ensure that children have adequate facilities where they stay, including access to a safe environment free of hazards, running water, clean drinking water, regular electricity, and protection from violence in the community. 


### Current Reality

**From Literature and from the Field**

- A small-scale assessment in India, of the living conditions to which the children moved after restoration showed that many children live in ‘kuchcha’ type houses.  
- In some cases, there was no information about where children were moved to because of a lack of a follow-up.
- In a study conducted on restoration practices in India, In some houses, there was no access to clean drinking water facilities for the children. In many homes, toilets were outside the houses, and children did not have access to toilets within their own homes. This puts children at greater risk for harm when they need to use toilet facilities at night. 
- From our field visits, we’ve heard accounts of some children, specifically girls being in danger of physical harm and abuse in their communities.
- We’ve also heard accounts of some children with little to no supervision at home because of the long working hours of parents and caregivers.
- For some children, access to the internet at home is a luxury, and they often need to walk many kilometers for online classes and any telephonic conversation. 


## Care and Protection

- While safety has a more physical connotation of keeping the child safe, care and protection include the socio-cultural elements of a child’s well-being. 
- For children moving to impoverished, low-resource communities, there may be disrupting instances and elements in the immediate social environment of children that might make them vulnerable to exploitation and neglect, including families that are not emotionally ready to accept them.
- Some negative social influences in the community can include peer pressure to use or sell drugs, high incidences of sexual violence against women, poor or disintegrated social protection systems, low vigilance by local administrators and law enforcement, etc.


### Current Reality

**From Literature and from the Field**
  

- For children restored to their families, in some cases, care is limited because of constraints of time and emotional bandwidth for parents working long hours and physically intensive jobs. Sometimes, parents struggle to find time to spend with their children. 
- In low-resource communities, children are more vulnerable to picking up negative habits of alcohol and substance abuse issues, primarily because of a lack of monitoring and supervision during their day-to-day activities. 
- In our conversations with children and care leavers, conversations around mental health and psychosocial well-being are not always encouraged when there are gaps in awareness in the community. Prevalent attitudes and beliefs influence narratives of how children are expected to behave, and the care that they need.

## Access to opportunities and development

- An individual care plan for children post-restoration should capture the interests, skills, and needs of the children while assessing their educational trajectory and career plans.
- One of the most important steps to rehabilitation and reintegration is to help young adults prepare to be economically self-reliant through long-term career prospects.
- Independent living skills such as basic financial skills, negotiating and purchasing, cooking and managing household activities, undertaking minor repair work at home, and traveling independently by using public and private transport, are crucial for children to manage their lives in the community. 
- For children’s development, there should be a focus on building allied skills like personal care, conflict resolutions, personal safety, digital skills, crisis management, and improved awareness of societal issues to create good reintegration outcomes. 

### Current Reality

**From Literature and from the Field**
- The average household income of families with children in institutions is often insufficient to support the holistic development of the child.
- Small-scale studies on the outcomes of children restored to families also indicate that many children discontinue their studies under changed family circumstances.
- Some children restored to families also were found to not be attending school regularly or were forced to drop out against their wishes during stressful family conditions. 


## Good Health & Hygiene
- When a child is in an institution, the food and nutrition requirements are taken care of and monitored regularly as per the prescribed guidelines of the leadership. However, once the child is restored to their family, the child’s access to healthy and nutritious food needs to be assessed by the case workers through regular interaction and follow-ups with the family 
- There needs to be a clear focus on building awareness about, and in improving relevant family practices around gender, and other social biases about food and nutrition that impact on the child’s overall growth and development.
- For some children, special nutritional inputs and closer health monitoring might be required for children recovering from illness and deficiencies like iron, malnourishment, or communicable diseases that affect immunity. Families should be supported in preparing the right menu plans and in providing the necessary inputs. 
- Cleanliness and sanitation, both within the residence and in the immediate external environment, need to be assessed by the institution, before restoration. This includes, and is not limited to, waste disposal mechanisms, usage and disposal of wastewater, access to bathrooms and toilets, and water for drinking and household purposes.
- Before a child is restored to their family, a detailed physical assessment is conducted by the institution, and if the child is undergoing treatment, the continuation of that treatment post restoration becomes an integral part of the child’s rehabilitation plan.
- Conduct regular follow-ups: Case workers also actively follow up with family and/or with the health facility on the treatment that is being provided to the child after restoration.
- For children with mental health conditions and suffering from psychological distress, access to mental health support is crucial. 

### Current Reality

**From Literature and from the Field**

- For children restored to families, the socioeconomic conditions in families sometimes prevent access to proper health facilities and regular health assessments. 
- We’ve heard accounts of children restored to families from institutions reporting falling sick on a regular basis.
- Specialized nutritional inputs and fully-balanced meals are not always available for children in low-resource settings. 
Public awareness of mental health is extremely low, especially within low-income communities, and there is a general reluctance to approach mental health services
  

## Social Integration and Social Protection

- Social protection services need to be offered to children leaving institutions through identity and eligibility documents, such as Aadhar cards, ration cards, or voter IDs.
- Social reintegration is the last link in the rehabilitation of children leaving care. The aim of social reintegration is to help a child overcome the stigma and discrimination of being from an institution.
- Children need to participate actively in the community, forming new relationships with their families and peers in the neighborhood. Acceptance is key to the success of reintegration.
- While legal measures, social awareness and education are important, children must also have access to counseling and training to deal with adverse and hostile social environments.

### Current Reality

**From Literature and from the Field**
  
- In a study of children restored to their families, many children were found not to have friends in their neighborhood, indicating gaps in social reintegration.
- Some children, in the same study, were reported to be either aggressive or depressive after being deinstitutionalized.
- In many cases, the institutions make no attempt at linking or giving awareness about the Government Sponsorship scheme or other schemes such as MNREGS, NRLM, etc. to any of the children or their families.


## Post-restoration follow-up

### Optimal practices for regular post-restoration monitoring

- For children being restored to families, regular follow-up is essential to adjust the expectations of the families.
- Follow-up visits can also encourage parents to be patient and review positive discipline techniques in dealing with difficulties managing emotions during this transitory phase.
- Institutional follow-up can also refer the families to community resources as needed.
- In general, the case worker from the institution should make periodic visits that decrease in frequency over time, with a clear point of contact established in case problems arise.
- Follow-up is also important to ensure that children and families have ongoing access to health care, education, and other basic services.
- Caseworkers can also provide a space for children to discuss their experiences and to receive therapeutic support where necessary.
Finally, if reintegration fails, the child needs to be placed in alternative care whilst other options are considered.

  
### Current Reality

**From Literature and from the Field**

- From research on restoration in India, it is clear that follow-up visits are not regularly conducted by institutions to ensure the implementation of individual care plans or aftercare plans for children. 
- Caregivers have also reported cases of parents and families that are unhappy with the involvement of the institution in caring for their children, after restoration. 
- Many institutions report that families are unlikely to keep in touch or update their contact information with the institution when they move around or migrate to cities
- While some institutions keep in touch with a few children over the telephone or Whatsapp, we’ve noticed that there are only a few organized mechanisms for regular monitoring of children leaving care. 
- Children leaving institutions are often not part of alumni groups or associations that would allow them to continue relationships with their friends and staff from the institution.
