[[Physical Health]]

# Introduction to the domain

As reported by UNICEF, tremendous progress has been made in infant and maternal health over the past few decades. Older children and adolescents (aged 5–19 years) now make up a quarter of the world population. It is essential to now focus on ensuring that they stay healthy for them to thrive. The effects of acute and chronic infectious diseases and other physical health ailments need to be seriously considered to improve life outcomes for individual children and for larger societal growth. Closer attention needs to be paid to the consequences of long-lasting negative health conditions in childhood because long-term morbidity can have a major impact on children’s ability to grow into fully functional adults. 

It is important to mention that studies show that children in vulnerable social positions often find it extremely difficult to access quality care for acute and chronic health conditions and find it harder to self-report health concerns. They lack comprehensive health services, immunizations, routine health surveillance, and health promotion, putting them at a higher risk for preventable diseases. 

As defined by the NHS in the UK, the Health Ministry in Australia, and the Indian government, the following principles are key for improving outcomes for children in care.

- Institutions need to deliver health services that are tailored to the individual and diverse needs of children and young people.
- Children need to be allowed to actively participate in crucial health decisions, building awareness and accountability.
- Institutions should emphasize a preventative approach versus a curative approach to health; focus on building safety and resilience.
- All health needs should be immediately discussed and addressed with trained staff.
- Make sure all professionals working with children have a clear understanding of the protocol and warning signs to escalate attention.
- Be holistic, including consideration of physical health, sexual, emotional, and mental health, well-being, and health promotion

## Overview of Physical Health in Child Care Institutions


Health is a highly individual matter, often requiring one-on-one attention, putting institutions at a disadvantage. A joint study by University College London (UCL) and King’s College London analyzed the data from 350,000 people who self-reported their health after 10, 20, and 30 years. They discovered that adults who lived in institutional care during childhood had a 40 percent chance of reporting poor health 10 years later. This rose to an 85 percent chance over the following two decades. 

Children growing up in institutions often have the same health concerns as their peers, but often to a greater degree. This can be attributed to the fact that they often enter care with a worse level of health than their peers in part due to the impact of poverty, abuse, and neglect. Despite existing systems in place, it is known that children in institutions have higher degrees of trauma-related injuries, developmental delays, sinusitis, asthma, bowel dysfunction, skin-related issues, and visuo-auditory deficits. 

From observational insights and existing literature, the following are a few factors that influence the quality of health outcomes in institutional care:
- Poor living conditions and utilization of facilities: The high prevalence of infectious diseases in children in institutions shows how substandard infrastructure, hygiene practices and poor utilization of healthcare facilities can lead to challenging outcomes for children, despite almost universal access to doctors. This often includes a lack of health surveillance and routine immunizations.
- Lack of awareness: Many diseases were found to be present due to a lack of awareness about disease causation, clearly demonstrating a gap in how the staff approach health. Further, none of the children knew about the complications of most diseases under study, even when they were suffering from them.
- Reliance on traditional knowledge systems: Treatment-seeking practices often show a preference for self-diagnosis, and self-medication and the staff prescribe commonly available drugs without always consulting pediatricians or other specialist doctors. There is also a heavy emphasis on alternate forms of medicine, including homeopathy, Ayurveda, and home remedies.
- Poor nutrition: Poor nutritional status has been shown to be widely prevalent and directly associated with morbidities among institutionalized children.
- Low immunity at a younger age: It is also known that morbidities tend to be higher among younger age groups which may be explained by their lower immunity levels and young age as a risk factor for most diseases. Many children enter institutions in fairly deprived circumstances and this has a direct impact on their innate immunity levels.

## Stakeholders

In an institution, the primary stakeholders responsible for good health in children are the medical/para-medical staff, caregivers, leadership, kitchen staff, and the children themselves. 

- As mandated by the JJ Act, the JJ model rules, and individual state rules, it is essential for every institution to have a **medical staff** (registered nurse or paramedical staff) stay 24/7 at the home. The medical staff is the primary stakeholder in monitoring & intervening in the health status of children there. It’s also the responsibility of the medical staff to contribute information for the monthly medical reports, and the quarterly growth tracking and to coordinate specialist care whenever required. The medical staff also track the over-the-counter medications available in the dispensary and issue medications only when necessary. 
- For the medical staff to provide individual care to children that need it, it falls to the **house parents and primary caregivers** of children at the home to identify symptoms of common diseases, notice dips in energy and performance, and pay close attention to the hygiene habits of the children to highlight essential information to the medical staff. Without their close attention, it is practically impossible for the medical staff to cater to all the children at the home. 
- It’s also important for the **leadership** to be actively involved in the health of the children because it’s up to the leadership to take crucial decisions regarding hospitalizations, external specialist care, fundraising for elective procedures, and to communicate  with the relevant government authorities about long term health consequences of children with chronic diseases/ serious injuries. 
- The **kitchen staff** is also involved in the health of the children, in ensuring that children with special dietary needs are catered to. 
- **Children** are active participants in their own health outcomes in having the awareness and vocabulary to articulate symptoms of distress as well as to report or highlight symptoms in peers.



# Physical Health Outcomes

## Optimal Adult Outcomes

- Care leavers have timely access to mainstream and specialist health services which meet their physical and mental health needs.
- Care leavers are able to independently assess, evaluate and manage health concerns and understand what they need to do to achieve a healthy lifestyle.
- Young people leaving care should be aware of how to access adult health services, and possess a comprehensive health record of their time at the institution.
- Care leavers have the financial support system to avail  health services, including comprehensive health insurance.
- Care leavers do not suffer from chronic health issues tied to institutional care, that disrupt their education Care leavers possess a support system that they can lean on during times of illness.


## Current Reality

### From Literature:

- There is a relative lack of research on the health outcomes of care leavers, especially of those over the age of 25. According to a report from the care leaver’s associations in the UK, health outcomes for care leavers are poorer than that of their peers. And this goes for care leavers of all ages. 
- From research in the US, we know that  30% to 60% of children with a background in foster care have been estimated to have chronic health conditions. When behavioral, emotional, and developmental concerns are taken into consideration, the estimated proportion of foster children with serious health care needs jumps to 80%.
- From research in India, we know that care leavers struggle to report high scores on the Physical Health Index, often reporting multiple struggles with their health when they leave residential care.
- In a study conducted by Udayan Care, many care leavers reported that they did not have someone who could provide care in case of illness, or if they did, they could not rely on them for more than a few days. Those who are left without care and support in times of need or emergencies are more vulnerable to having poor health, longer recuperation times, and incomplete recovery. 
- More than 75% of care leavers in India do not possess health insurance. This number rises to close to 88% in women. This means that all health expenses are out-of-pocket expenditures that greatly threaten the financial stability of careleavers who lack existing systems of support. 


### From the Field:

- Care leavers do not typically have form relationships with local doctors and medical practitioners in their community, increasing barriers when quick diagnosis or treatment needs arise.
- Care leavers with long-term chronic concerns are often unable to maintain regular check-ups and treatments once they leave the institution, due to factors including instability, finances, job security etc. They are often not able to replicate medical support systems in different ecosystems when moving for work etc.
- Many care leavers deal with long-term chronic issues and injuries that were not resolved in their childhood at the institution. This impacts their employability and general life satisfaction.
- Care leavers can lack awareness of their own health issues and precautionary steps because they were not involved in medical decisions at the institution; their medical history is often incomplete.
- Care leavers receive little to no training on safe sex practices and women are more susceptible to unplanned pregnancies and STDs.

 

# Physical Health Indicators and Inputs

 
## Optimal Childhood Indicators

- Children in care must have a comprehensive and updated health assessment record from entry to exit from the CCI.
- Children must be aware of their health conditions and treatment plans, including a clear aftercare plan for when they leave the institution.
- Chronic health conditions are maintained at manageable levels with only absolutely essential disruptions to the day-to-day activities of the children.
- Children spend minimum time out of school because of health conditions and illnesses. 
- Children are safe and secure from injuries and environmental hazards at the institution.
- Children are well-aware of their health conditions and any treatments given have appropriate consent taken. Children and staff are well-aware of different aspects of health, and common health conditions, and are able to quickly identify symptoms of ill health.
- Children are within the normal range of height and weight as per individual expectations by age.
- Children in institutions are not any more vulnerable/susceptible to illness relative to the general population. Rates of illness and injuries should be comparable to non-institutional settings.
- Children are active and energetic and engage well in play, and school and after-school activities. 
- Children show a well-developed immune system capable of resisting and responding to common infections. Children are able to recover quickly and bounce back from common infections and minor injuries.


## Current Reality

### From Literature:
- From research in institutions in India, we know that general awareness about the importance of health and prevailing health conditions is inadequate, amongst both staff and children
- Various studies have shown that illness among children in institutions is higher (30%) especially diarrheal disease compared with 7 % in non-institutionalized children.
- Many studies have established that most caregivers lack nutrition awareness which often leads to nutritional deficiencies being neglected. 
- According to older research on institutional care, growth failure in terms of height and weight is associated with CCIs, often becoming worse as the period of stay lengthens.
- Children whose caregivers had not received any form of training on care practices were more likely to be underweight, wasted, and stunted respectively.
- Children in institutions in India report higher rates relative to the general population of trauma-related injuries, development delays, intestinal parasites, sinusitis, anaemia and asthma, skin conditions like eczema, visual and neurological deficits as well as other disabilities.
- In small, well-run institutions it has been found that health, emotional functioning, learning ability, memory, and physical growth were comparable, on average, with children from familial settings in low-to-middle income countries.
- According to a large-scale literature review on institutional care conducted by the University of Delaware, relative to their peers, children in CCIs show atypically short height, low weight, and small head circumference


### From the Field:

- Typically, health records include the height and weight measurements taken at a variable frequency, with a limited recording of past illnesses, with a limited recording of past illnesses, vaccinations, regular elective checks, blood reports, etc. 
- Health records can be incomplete, leading to difficulty in diagnosis and in maintaining essential follow-up care for children undergoing treatment.
- The frequency of injuries can be high due to environmental hazards such as under-maintained playgrounds, clutter or unsafe items in living areas.
- Disease and infections may persist for longer than ideal due to difficulties in tracking and following up on prescriptions and appointments.
- Lifestyle conditions sometimes persist due to limitations on funding available for elective and expensive procedures.
- Health incidents can be frequent due to varying hygiene levels, and high density of children in small School regularity is low for children with untreated or chronic medical conditions.
- Avoidable health complications can occur due to delays in response time to health incidents because of factors such as inadequate staffing, reliance on home remedies & self-medication, and degrees of separation of CCIs from doctors.
- Poor hygiene standards such as nail length, hair and body cleanliness, bathing frequency, etc have a direct correlation with health outcomes.
- Teenage boys and girls are often unaware of puberty driven changes required to their hygiene and health practices.
- High rates of infections like the common cold, fever, and skin conditions are reported in institutions, relative to the general population. Some children are constantly in a state of ill-health.


# Suggested Childhood Inputs

_You can find the official recommendations for physical health from the Juvenile Justice Act attached in the annexure of this document_

- Access to a medical facility in-house and a regular on-call doctor to build patient comfort.
- Exercise is a part of the daily schedule and participation in sports is encouraged for both boys and girls.
- Children are regularly trained on symptom awareness and identification , and given the vocabulary to communicate regarding discomfort.
- Every child shall have access to relevant information, knowledge, and skills regarding health that are appropriate for their age, gender, culture, language, and context.
- Children have access to clean toilets that are disinfected at least twice a day.
- Children are given personal toiletries so that they are not required to share.
- Symptoms of infectious diseases are quickly identified and children are quarantined when needed.
- Caregivers are regularly trained on medical procedures, maintaining the dispensary, and updated on first aid protocol.
- Disruption in caregiving needs to be minimal because it has been shown to have a negative impact on the health outcomes of children.
- Access to specialized services or trained in-house staff to detect and handle drug and substance abuse related issues.
- Health assessment needs to be a continuous process, not an isolated event. It needs to have a flexible approach appropriate to the child and stage of development. This includes regular growth monitoring.
- Children need to be trained on essential personal hygiene practices to maintain good health. Caregivers need to remind children regularly about the importance of these practices.
- Waste disposal should be carefully thought-out. Waste management plays a crucial role in pest control, hygiene standards, and the overall health of children.
- Proper ventilation and lighting are crucial in creating a healthy living environment for children.
- Health education and health camps are necessary to encourage children to learn skills and habits about food, exercise, hygiene, sleep rest, and relaxation. 
- Children should know and accept individual and collective responsibility for healthy living.
- Health and immunization records should be updated and maintained frequently.
- Preventative checkups and tests need to be conducted at a fixed frequency to ensure early diagnosis and treatment.
- Regular deworming has health benefits linked to positive mental and physical health development of children.
- Confidentiality of health records needs to be maintained.


## Current Reality

### From Literature:

- Children whose caregivers had not received any form of training in health practices were more likely to be underweight, wasted, and stunted respectively.
- Children are often predisposed to malnutrition and infectious diseases like respiratory tract infections and diarrhoea due to unhygienic conditions, unavailability of safe and nutritious food.
- Given the high turnover in the staff in institutions, caregiving disruptions within institutional care, which adults may view as trivial and even routine, can have significant additional effects on child wellbeing. The stress of having to accommodate changing care environments alters normal developmental processes and changes outcomes for the worse.
- Consumption of meat, fruits, and vegetables was low. Low consumption of fruits and vegetables could expose children to the risk of micronutrient deficiencies that are often hidden and take a long time to identify.
- Knowledge of signs and symptoms of common childhood morbidities was low among resident children, especially for fevers, skin infections/ infestations, and ear conditions.
- Hospital care is sought for very few cases. This is of concern since most of the morbidities in children are accompanied by frequent complications, thereby increasing the morbidity burden further.
- In institutions in India, the severe constraint of space is reported to be the contributing factor to health problems from overcrowding and infectious spread.

  
### From the Field:

- Physical fitness expectations are sometimes gendered, with boys being given more opportunities to exercise.
- Consent from parents is not a standardized protocol; often parents are kept out of children’s medical decisions.
- There is a lack of stability in providing healthcare services since the home partners with different organizaitons for health camps which prevents any one medical partner having a full understanding of the medical history of a child.
- Infections are hard to control in highly-dense settings, and isolation rooms either insufficient or not utilized in time.
- Vaccination follow-up is not universal and immunizations are not complete for all children.
- While children are provided with personal toiletries, caregivers find it difficult to ensure that they do not share soaps, brushes, and combs. 
- Health assessment tends to be more ad-hoc, dependent on external partners that conduct medical camps once or twice a year. 
- Follow-up treatment for diagnosed conditions is sometimes missed because elective procedures are often more expensive and are not subsidized by medical professionals. 
- Toilets and bathrooms are mostly cleaned once a day. In an institutional setting, this often leads to children using unhygienic, soiled toilets which can cause many infections. 
- Caregivers are not trained regularly on health practices, common symptoms of illnesses, and necessary follow-up protocols for children with long-term conditions. 
- Sex education is non-existent in a majority of institutions. 
- Bedsheets, pillowcases, and other commonly used household items are sometimes not replaced and cleaned regularly enough to keep them sanitary.
- Confidentiality of health records are not always maintained, with information on health conditions sometimes shared openly to third parties.

  
# Key Excerpts from Research


## From Literature

- **Strongly interlinked with nutrition:** Child malnutrition is associated with susceptibility to infection and as a result, many children are more likely to be prone to common childhood ailments such as diarrhoea and respiratory infections; and for those who survive, frequent illness affects their nutrition status due to lowered resistance to infections. (Wei, 2011)
- **Early care consequences:** Early childhood trauma/toxic stress, especially if frequent or unremitting and not tempered by responsive, nurturing caregiving, adversely affects the neurobiology of the developing brain. (Nelson, 2020)
- **Common Infections** observed in institutionalized children
	- Skin infections were reported most commonly followed by common cold and fever, and dental concerns.
	- Diarrheal disease and Respiratory Infections: Some studies were done on children residing in urban slums where the prevalence of diarrheal disease and respiratory infections has been reported to be higher than our population . (Toutem, 2018)

- **Contrasting data:** The Positive Outcomes for Orphans (POFO) study is the only one that enrolled a statistically representative sample of both institution-based and family-based orphaned and separated children (OSC) from culturally diverse sites across multiple low-income countries. The study shows that health, emotional functioning, learning ability, memory, and physical growth were comparable, on average, for children living in institutional care settings and the children living with families in the same regions. (Thielman, 2012)
- **Ethical considerations in health:** Obtaining consent to information sharing is a vital first principle to promoting the health of children in care. The person or third party will need to understand the reasons why particular information needs to be shared so that they can give informed consent. (Department of Health and Social Care, UK).
- The balance between autonomy and paternalism; Institutions need to make sure that children participate in their own health issues and inform them of the inventions that are in place. (Save the Childre, 2016)

## From the Field

- **Health documentation & updates**
A crucial element of a health system in an institution is down to the record keeping and regularly updating cycles of information about the health conditions of each child. In well-organized institutions, medical files for each child are separate, with every single piece of paper from the doctor’s office carefully collected for a comprehensive medical history. In many institutions, however, what’s typically recorded regularly is the dispensary stock and documentation for hospital visits.

- **Continuity of healthcare providers**
Camps are conducted at least twice a year in a majority of institutions. These camps are often conducted by different NGOs and organizations based on availability thus making continuity in medical care is a resulting challenge. Institutions that have more long term tie ups with specific medical service providers typically do not have this issue.

- **Home environment & overcrowding**
In many institutions, a severe lack of space, separation, and ventilation in the residential dorms for children is seen. Space constraints often make it harder to control infection spread, and lead to poor living conditions for children in institutions.  Also, infirmaries, if available, are under equipped and rarely used.


- **Personal hygiene and increased infections**
Sharing personal supplies like soaps, shampoos, and toothbrushes can lead to a spread of fungal infections and skin disorders that are the most commonly observed disease conditions in children in institutions. Poor cleaning routines in toilets and bathrooms also increase susceptibility to these conditions. 

- **Exercise routine and active schedules** 
 Physical activity is an essential part of maintaining good health. Routines should allow for sufficient time for children to partake in any form of physical activity, including sports, dance, zumba, as well as unstructured play. Building exercise habits into children’s routines can be critical to long-term health outcomes. or free play. Routines should not be so rigid as to restrict physical activity and allow for unstructured active play.


- **Gender-specific health concerns and policies** 
It’s essential for institutions to cater to gender and disability differences in children while preparing for optimal health practices. For older girls, it becomes vital to focus on menstrual health, sex education, and more common adolescent conditions like anemia. Similarly, boys need to receive training on appropriate self-hygiene practices and sex education. This variation needs to be accounted for in any health manual.  

Menstrual product issuance and waste disposal procedures are widely varying between institutions. The approach to puberty and associated changes is often heavily influenced by societal and traditional norms of the surrounding community.
