# Introduction
Aftercare refers to providing support, financially, or otherwise, to persons, who have completed 18 years of age but not completed 21 years, and have left any institutional care to join mainstream society. According to a multinational comparison of caregivers, the findings suggest that **employment** is the main challenge for care-leavers. Not far behind, **education, housing and poverty** were perceived as main challenges, followed by **mental health and delinquency**

In fact, the availability of appropriate aftercare services for careleavers has a dramatic impact on whether young people thrive or falter. 

# The Gold Standard in Aftercare 

## Target Outcomes 
- Careleavers are able to smoothly transition from childhood to adulthood by participation in the community life
- Careleavers have academic qualifications and skills for gainful employment/entrepreneurship for economic self reliance
- Careleavers have essential life skills for self - esteem, including emotional intelligence, communication skills and relationship skills
- Careleavers are able to live independently, knowing their citizenship rights and responsibilities such as financial literacy, identity documents, etc.

## Indicative Outputs
- In preparation for transition, each child has a strong Individual Care Plan (ICP) as a tool for planning for the overall development of the child, with close and activie participation from the careleaver
- Careleavers are supported to continue higher-education or specialised vocational training programs until they are employed
- Careleavers are shown to be confident about being able to live independently with/without state support, through regular assessments 
- Careleavers are able to create healthy interpersonal relationships and access mental health services to support stable emotional well-being 

# Key Levers at CCIs


> [!info]- Individualization of Care
> - Individual care plans and individual aftercare plans are used and updated for all children
> - The aftercare plan for development of the careleaver considers age, gender, trauma, special needs, sexual orientation, academic abilities, educational, vocational skills, mental health and physical health conditions
> - The Individual Care Plan is reviewed every 6 months

> [!info]- Access to safe living spaces
> - Physical spaces i.e Aftercare homes or group homes must be located within the same community to facilitate the integration process. 
> - Careleavers will be encouraged to live together as a family unit and learn to share responsibilities of running their own kitchen and home. 
> - The CCI will conduct visits to the spaces to check the physical safety of structures, as well as the physical and social environment. 
> - Orient the residents of the home with the community- negotiate ground rules and relationships with the landlords and community members
> - The organization follows a participatory process to put together a list of practices that are in the best interests of the careleavers 
> - Organizes orientations on personal safety, including sharing details of helplines and support organizations in the neighbourhood, including the police stations. 

> [!info]- Mobility and Self- Dependence
> - Equip careleavers with basic conflict resolution skills, financial management and create systems for rederessal and reporting, for escalations. 
> - Complete an access audit, to ensure careleavers are aware of access to public transit systems, basic civic amenities, educational institutions and vocational training centres. 
> - Impart life-skills training through individual and group training sessions- to focus on relationships, self & social acceptance, problem-solving skills. 

> [!info]- Social Protection and Welfare 
> - The CCI needs to ensure that the  essential documents such as the Aadhar card, PAN card, bank account, and school - leaving certificate are arranged for all resident children. 
> - Facilitates mentorship: Actively mentor residents to keep them motivated and avoid drop - outs. This also includes career counseling to help residents make decisions about their future.
> - Constructive recreation established as a right of the residents by ensuring that an activity of leisure or recreation is included in the residentsâ€™ daily schedule. The counselors also engage with the resident careleavers regularly on the importance of self - care.
> - If the careleaver is returning to a previously hostile family environment, it is important for the family and community to support (if genuinely interested) in evaluating if the move back to the family is the best move for the careleaver. 

> [!info]- Education & Employability 
> -  Develops a directory of resources: Puts together a resource directory of schools, colleges, and distance learning universities to help residents choose options based on their interests.
> - Careleavers provided with the training and awareness about different government schemes and private scholarships available for use
> - Actively explores marketable skills for residents through consultations. It seeks to design and administer vocational training p rograms for young adults and care leavers that, eventually, help them land good jobs.
> - Liaisons with corporates: Mobilizes corporates for vocation training programs for care leavers with minimal educational restrictions. Makes referrals and follow - ups with the service provider to assess the progress of the girls, and hopefully, translate training into job placements.

For these levers to work, the **primary challenges and potential opportunities are :** 

> [!bug]- Independence and increased susceptibility 
> - The newfound independence can also be hard to adjust to for some careleavers.Some have a hard time learning to prioritize savings and end up spending more on clothes, footwear, make - up, mobile phones, etc. as compared to food and hygiene supplies.
> - When people of different age groups stay together, there is a risk of younger residents being dominated or bullied by the older ones.
> - Once supervision is significantly reduced and girls get relatively greater freedom, there may be a risk of exposure to trafficking, re - trafficking, or exploitation

## CCI Immersion 

- The Goal of the immersion phase in Aftercare is to: 
	- Gauge baseline levels of attention and time spent on preparing children for transition
	- Gauge the extent of support available to careleavers once they step out of the institution
	- Identify gaps in Knowledge/Skills/Minsets of CCI staff and other stakeholders in preparing and executing the Individualised Care Plan
	- Identify key challenge areas preventing CCIs from building a comprehensive Aftercare support system for careleavers
	- Gauge the readiness of careleavers in transitioning to an independent life
