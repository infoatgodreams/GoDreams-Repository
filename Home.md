# ðŸŒ³Welcome to the Repository for CAP 3 Research

The purpose of this portal is to access information that we've compiled from studying the ecosystem surrounding **Child Care Institutions (CCIs)** in India towards the development of what we are calling the "Capacity Accelerator Program"

>***The Problem***: Children in Need of Care and Protection (CNCP) in India are not achieving ***positive adult outcomes***.

CCIs are the bedrock of childcare, intended to offer a safe space for children outside of family units to thrive. 

> 95% of CCIs in India are **small privately run institutions**.

> Most of these CCIs **do not have the capability or capacity to deliver high quality care** or **to reach all CNCP.**


This is primarily due to

```co 
Lack of outcome focused financial capital
```

and 

```co
No access to evidence based care practices and benchmarks. 

i.e. Lack of knowledge
```
