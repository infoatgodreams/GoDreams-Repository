# ðŸŒ³Welcome to the Repository for CAP 3 Research

The purpose of this portal is to access information that we've compiled from studying the ecosystem surrounding **Child Care Institutions (CCIs)** in India towards the development of what we are calling the "Capacity Accelerator Program"

***The Problem***: 

```co
Children in Need of Care and Protection (CNCP) in India are not achieving positive adult outcomes.
```

CCIs are the bedrock of childcare, intended to offer a safe space for children outside of family units to thrive. 

==95% of CCIs in India are **small privately run institutions** that do not have the capability or capacity to deliver high quality care or to reach all CNCP==

This is primarily a consequence of:
 
```co
1. Lack of outcome focused financial capital.
```

```co 
2. Limited access to evidence based care practices and benchmarks. 
```
