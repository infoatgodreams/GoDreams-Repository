# 🌳Welcome to the Repository for CAP Research 

The purpose of this portal is to access information that we've compiled from studying the ecosystem surrounding **Child Care Institutions (CCIs)** in India towards the development of what we are calling the "Capacity Accelerator Program"

==[Click Here](Program%20Design/Surveys/User%20Problems%20Simulation.md) to participate in a user design survey, drawing on our experiences to articulate the problems we want to solve with CAP!==

>The ongoing activity is the the [Literature Review](Program%20Design/02%20Literature%20Review.md). A good place to start digging into the content would be the [🗞️Domain Roll Up Index](Index%20Pages/🗞️Domain%20Roll%20Up%20Index.md) or the [🧘Stakeholder Index](Index%20Pages/🧘Stakeholder%20Index.md).  (Alternatively use the  [📜Comprehensive Index](Index%20Pages/📜Comprehensive%20Index.md) or the [🏷️Tags Index](Index%20Pages/🏷️Tags%20Index.md) for a full deep dive)

## ⚠️The Problem 

```co
Children in Need of Care and Protection (CNCP) in India are not achieving positive adult outcomes.
```

CCIs are the bedrock of childcare, intended to offer a safe space for children outside of family units to thrive. 

==95% of CCIs in India are **small privately run institutions** that do not have the capability or capacity to deliver high quality care or to reach all CNCP==

This is primarily a consequence of:
 
```co
1. Lack of outcome focused financial capital.
```

```co 
2. Limited access to evidence based care practices and benchmarks. 
```


## 🔍The Solution

The CCI **Capacity Accelerator Program** will
```co
Upgrade and build the capacity & capability of CCIs to meet the gold standard in child care.
```

through the following pillars: 

1. **The Care Standards Framework (CSF)**: A comprehensive curriculum framework that will define: 
	1. ==Benchmarks for excellent outcomes== for children in institutional care
	2. ==Systems, learning modules and growth paths== to upgrade care practices and organization practices towards achieving these outcomes
	3. ==Data and M&E Systems== to measure and tie short term inputs to long term outcomes
2. **Financial Grant**
	1. ==Growth funding== that will incentivize and enable rapid improvements in care quality and organizational sustainability
	2. ==Tied to inputs that lead to long term outcomes==, ensuring that spending decisions are rooted in the best interest of the child
3. **Embedded Management**
	1. ==Hands-on support to CCI leadership and staff== to facilitate contextualized progress to benchmark care quality targets.
