# Summary

The traditional dogma in the startup ecosystem is that you can’t predict whether people will want your product. Instead, you do some customer research, throw an MVP out there as fast as possible, and hope it hits. That’s not my approach.

We started by testing specific _hypotheses_ that we had about a market. We evaluated the veracity of those hypotheses individually using Minimum Viable Tests. Collectively, these tests allowed us to predict whether a market was going to appreciate our product before we even launched an MVP.]

 An MVP is a basic early version of a product that looks and feels like a simplified version of the eventual vision. **An MVT, on the other hand, does not attempt to look like the eventual product. It’s rather a specific test of an assumption that** **_must_** **be true for the business to succeed**.
 
 I believe you can more efficiently run a number of MVTs, create a vision for a product that fits a market and _then_ go into a “build phase.”

## The case against the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

I’ve seen founders make dozens of mistakes during the pre-product/market fit phase. Here are a few examples:

### First, their vision is bigger than their insight
You can’t have 20 insights and be successful — you must have just one.

### Second, founders over-focus on what the customer says.

### Third, founders get caught up in company-building before nailing product/market fit

### Fourth, the word “product” in MVP implies an experience that has a distinct form. 
You’ve created the user journey you want your customer to go through, and you’ve narrowed that down to the smallest possible thing you can launch with. In many cases, this smallest possible thing isn’t small. It could entail a login system, a tech stack, a database and sometimes even an admin dashboard. For the user, it involves an onboarding flow and a “customer experience.” This leads to overbuilt MVPs and isn’t really where you should start. You only want to build the login systems and onboarding flows _after_ you’ve proven that you have something you can sell, aka after you have succeeded with a minimum viable test.

### Finally, MVPs often make for horrible core products.
When you start building a product, you start from a blank command screen. Once you start writing code, you start to add technical and product debt. So many startups I know end up spending half of their engineering cycles paying back this debt in years 2-4. Instead, I suggest you run MVTs and then _delete the code_ (better yet, don’t use code at all!) This allows you to start from a fresh slate when you are actually building the longer-term vision.


## Add Minimum Viable Tests (MVT) to the process of creating a startup

- Immerse yourself in a new industry.

- Use customer development to determine your user’s [jobs-to-be-done](https://review.firstround.com/build-products-that-solve-real-problems-with-this-lightweight-jtbd-framework "null") and how they currently accomplish those jobs.

```co
Jobs-to-be-done for CAP will be codetermined by users and by gold standard research
```

- Identify the promise you think you can make to help a user with their jobs-to-be-done.

- List the riskiest assumptions that might lead your business to succeed or fail.

- Test your assumptions through Minimum Viable Tests.

- Once tests are done and biggest hypothesis is de-risked

- Build an initial product to bring all of your insights together and test them with your target customer.

- Iterate on that product until you have nailed your product offering. AKA “Get to Product/Market Fit”

- Scale


## How do I design & run a MVT?

Something you _must_ be right about, or else the company won’t stand a chance.**Can you predict success before you launch?**

### Find your value proposition

**Focus on actions**. This is often driven by customer development, but remember that customers do not always know nor are they forthcoming about their desires and needs. Their actions, however, speak volumes. Find a value proposition that speaks to their actions: What are they already trying to do? How can you help them achieve their goals better than they know they can?

**Stay away from ideas that are too complicated**. Think about Stripe, AirBnB, Dropbox, Uber. They each had a ridiculously simple value proposition. The solution might have been complex or controversial, but the value to the consumer was not. Who wouldn’t want a taxi that arrives on demand in <5 minutes? Who wouldn’t want one line of code to replace the days of implementing complex payment processing systems? Find a value proposition that’s a no-brainer.

### List your risky Assumptions.

**The #1 riskiest assumption is building something people don’t want**.

**Execution risk is real**  Lots of great ideas die because they simply don’t work in reality.

**Marketing**: Do you know enough about your market to know how to sell it and who will buy it?

**Market size**. This is almost impossible to guess at and so many people hand wave their potential market size and put in fuzzy numbers. Low confidence is still better than no confidence. I strongly believe you should have a clear understanding of what you would want to see in order to believe there’s a big enough market for what you’re doing

**Profit**. Almost all startups start with upside down profit margins. That’s okay, but some companies will never get to positive margins.

### Test the atomic unit.

**Pick your risky assumption and test just one at a time**.

**Devise a test for that specific assumption**. If your riskiest hypothesis is execution risk: test out execution by actually trying to deliver the goods or services in as hack-y a way as possible. Remember in those cases to evaluate the profit ratio. You’ll learn what is going to be really tough and what is easier than you expected. From there, you can often devise second and third tests to dive even deeper to specific areas of concern. If your riskiest hypothesis is whether people will want your product, do not ask them. Force them to pay for it with their time or their money. If they don’t, then be honest with yourself about why and iterate until you find something people are absolutely in love with.


**When devising a test, do not build out everything. Focus only on the hypothesis**

**Pick a clear and specific atomic unit**. The more niche the better in this case. You are looking for the smallest possible item that you could distill your product down to.

## Pathways post MVT

### Path #1: Nail what your customers care about most

Don't build a full fledged product, start aggregative essential services

### Path #2: Ship the first version of your product

## Jobs to be done

Jobs are _not_ the same as your mission, vision or goals.
Jobs describe the **underlying human needs**, _not_ the features of the product.
Jobs illuminate **consumer insights on underlying motivations and struggles**, _not_ business objectives
Importantly, a job should highlight a **promising specific market opportunity about an unmet need**
