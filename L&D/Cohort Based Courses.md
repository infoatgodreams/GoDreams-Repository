# Introduction

- CBC: Group of selected students, coming together and taught a structured curriculum online with a fixed start and end date. 
	- Truly internet native format
- How CBC is maximizing the internet's potential: 
	- Extensive use of tech tools
	- No Geographical Limitations
	- Internet upgrade of pedagogical techniques
		- Teachers no longer have to create content 
		- They can focus on engaging the students 
	- Online communities
- ## Community vs independent learning
	- Community aspect helps the cohort push through difficult period of low performance, demotivation or the slump before seeing outcomes/ success
		- This could be critical to the CCIs becomes many strategies do not work instantly but require consistent reinforcement
		- It also pushed for completion of courses because of peer pressure/community based motivations
			- ==While completion rates are high, any stats on learning outcomes? Long term application of learning?==

## Format for CBCs
- What to teach? (Topic) + Whom to teach? (Audience) + What pressing problem(s) does your audience have that the course can help address
- Whats the ideal length of  CBC? are they better in shorter formats with narrower learning outcomes? (starters recommend 1 hour) 
	- Smaller sized cohorts do better 
	- Since its the same cohort in multiple courses, shorter vs longer?
	- Are there changes in completion rate proportionate to length? 
	- Are students differentiated into the CBC groups based on an entrance test? Are group homogenously created based on skill level etc or heterogenous?
