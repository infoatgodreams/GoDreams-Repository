# Auxilium Navajeevana Rainbow Home
The first CCI we visited, in early May, is a home that houses 55 girls from vulnerable family backgrounds. Registered in 1995, the Auxilium Society entered into a partnership with Rainbow Foundation of India on **???** in order to run this particular home. 

The Rainbow model enables a local partner like Auxilium to partner with the department of education to set up a residential facility within a Government School. The children (upto class 8) attend the GKMPS school in which the home is located, while older children attend a nearby high school.
