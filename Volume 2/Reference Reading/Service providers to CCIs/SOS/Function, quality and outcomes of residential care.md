- The papers included in the review cover data collected in 68 countries aroundthe world, with the most frequently represented country being Romania, followed by the United Statesof America and the UK. This reflects the western English language bias present in much academic work,as well as the impact of the Bucharest Early Intervention Project (BEIP), which is the data source for themajority of the papers that includeRomania. (Page 4)
- The evidence presented shows that the most important aspects in this domain in ensuring high qualitycare are those related to the environment: quality care is provided in settings that are familial, home-like, affording opportunities for connection, stimulating practices, and activities. Elements such asroutines and clear structures also contribute to the re-creation of a family environment, all of whichcontributes to an experience of daily life that is similar to those of children who are not in alternative care. (Page 5)
- Caregivers play a pivotal role from the moment of placement, providing information, creatingopportunities for participation and ensuring children and young people receive emotional support. Therelationship they establish with children is essential to children’s well-being and development. (Page 5)
- However,both the wealth of evidence from the BEIP (using a strong RCT methodology), and more piecemealevidence from other comparative studies, indicate that children and young people who are either initiallyplaced, or subsequently move to, family based environments are able to match children who were neverremoved from the home, and make up ground on disadvantages they may have experienced uponplacement. (Page 6)
- Large scale residential settings (institutions) are detrimental to the development andwellbeing of children and young people; (Page 7)
- In the context of a study on the interactions between affective caregivingand resilience in youth in institutions in Portugal, the nature of the physical and structural space isdeemed to have an effect on relationships (Mota et al., 2016). (Page 27)
- 26Children's own subjective well-being and satisfaction with their placement in residential care are linkedto the size of the setting - the smaller the size, the greater the level of satisfaction, possibly because (Page 27)
- they are more similar to a family environment, and therefore offering an experience of daily lifecomparable to that of the general child population (Llosada-Gistau, Montserrat, et al., 2017). (Page 28)
- Key indicators seem tobe training, supervision, turnover, continuity, and child-caregiver ratios (Farmer et al., 2017; Mota et al.,2016; Quiroga & Hamilton-Giachritsis, 2017). (Page 28)
- Higher quality care is characterised by carer(s) capacity to express warmth, sensitivity,playfulness during routine caregiving activities, such as feeding, bathing, changing, as well as throughdevelopmentally appropriate play, handling, positioning and interaction (Chernego et al., 2018). Carer(s)establishment of positive relationships with children depends upon their engagement, sensitivity,affection, and disciplinary style (Quiroga & Hamilton-Giachritsis, 2017). (Page 28)
- . A Nigerian study also highlights the potential ofgroup care over family based care, to provide for higher quality caregiver-child relationships becauseresidential carers are trained, guided by rules, and are expected to provide care to children (Ushie etal., 2016). (Page 28)
- Some note the importance of retaining contact and relationships beyond the time that children liveand are cared for within institutions (Page 28)
- Contextual understanding of children’s rights, the impact of neglect and abuse, childprotection legislation and system, the provision of alternative care, and the background toquality, standards and interventions in residential care (Page 29)
- Understanding child developmental milestones and the role of carer affect and behaviourin stimulating their achievement (Major, 2018) (Page 29)
- Developing an in depth understanding of attachment, attachment behaviours and theemotional needs of children (Hueche et al., 2019; Vacaru et al., 2018)An appreciation of the importance of family origins and ties (Llosada-Gistau, Casas, et al.,2017; Neagu & Sebba, 2019) (Page 29)
- Assessing and promoting professional self-awareness and self-control (Page 29)
- Using skills in working collaboratively with children and young people, assessment and caseplanning, crisis management, emotional support and behavioural interventions, engagingchildren in daily activities and acquisition of life skills (Page 29)
- The number of children each caregiver has under her care seems to be crucial, with larger groups ofchildren experiencing difficulties in establishing a secure attachment, while smaller groups facilitatesecurity (Page 30)
- On the latter point, studies point to the implementation of organisation wideapproaches to trauma informed care as a mechanism to prevent staff ‘burnout’ and reduce turnover(Bailey et al., 2019). (Page 30)
- Continuity of care setting is important for children’s relationships with their caregivers, their peers withinthe home, with wider friendships and relationships in school and the local community (Llosada-Gistau,Montserrat, et al., 2017; Mota et al., 2016). (Page 30)
- a study of fostercare compared with small group homes in Chile recommends: the reduction of child:caregiver ratios; ashift system that reduces the number of different caregivers in a week period; using a key personsystem; improving the end of placement process with time for preparing for separation; revisiting theage-based organisation of residential care with a ‘graduation’ system; and using flexible time framesaccording to a child’s needs (Quiroga et al., 2017). (Page 30)
- . Involving children and young people in collaborative planning can alsostrengthen approaches to managing or mitigating risks. (Page 31)
- Factors thatcontribute to a positive climate include: taking a strengths- based approach; open units; quality andexperience of staff; intensive, structured, and less emotionally charged treatment programme with variedactivities and a daily routine; active monitoring of programme implementation, improving safety protocolswith proper incident investigation, and integrating non-clinical staff members with protocols; havingsupervision protocols for staff members, continuous staff training, measures to prevent burnout, andclinical leadership; and small group size (Leipoldt et al., 2019). (Page 31)
- The data suggests that younger children are more at risk of abuse and boys are more atrisk of harsh punishments. T (Page 32)
- Emphasis is placed on the critical need for effective therapeutic care, psychologicalsupport or treatment to enable children to modify the internalising and externalising behaviours theyhave developed as a result of their experiences, in order to strengthen their potential to experiencepositive relationships and opportunities in their childhood and adulthood (Baptista et al., 2017; Wrightet al., 2019). (Page 32)
- Looking across this literature, indicators that may distinguish quality include: using an identifiabletreatment approach/programme; sufficient structure, routines, and predictability; a focus on positivegrowth and development; and well-functioning linkages between the residential setting and externalsupports/individuals (Page 32)
- Use of the Attachment Regulation and Competency framework inresidential care was found to be associated with a reduction in post-traumatic stress symptomology, (Page 32)
- Studies also draw attention to the place and contribution of targeted interventions for children (Bunea etal., 2017; Vacaru et al., 2018; Wright et al., 2019), especially those who have been subject to traffickingand sexual exploitation (Page 33)
- the regular use ofpsychological screening tools, particularly on admission into residential care and during the process ofpsychological assessment (Oliveira et al., 2015), and access to intensive (group and individual)counselling (Leloux-Opmeer et al., 2017). (Page 33)
- The use of routines,rules and boundaries help children develop trust and lead to a reduction in experiences of uncertaintyand challenging behaviours (Page 33)
- Emphasis is placed onthe need for intentional efforts to develop traits that aid a child’s development of strength, resilience andautonomy, such as fostering self- efficiency, self-esteem, an internal locus of control, optimism, planningabilities, and determination through access to a diversity of social opportunities (Page 34)
- Carer attention to children’s capacity and opportunity to form friendships and positive interactions withpeers is identified as critical to self-esteem and quality of life, in particular during adolescence whenpeers represent a significant influence on normative development (Hueche et al., 2019; Jozefiak &Kayed, 2015; Lino et al., 2016; Steels & Simpson, 2017; Swerts et al., 2019). (Page 34)
- Similarly, close attention to children’s knowledge of, and relationships with, their families of origin iscritical to children’s identity, wellbeing and mental health (Page 34)
- In order to consider meaningfully the ways in which residential care can provide high quality support,and the role it can play in meeting children’s needs and promote their rights, however, it is important tomove beyond elements relating to size and structure of the setting, and focus on relationships andinteractions (Page 35)
- A low child to caregiver ratio, or a key workersystem, for example, are other key determinants of success in this respect, as strong and stablerelationships are easier to form and maintain when caregivers are directly responsible for a smallernumber of children. (Page 35)
- Other papers found higher perceived conflict and self-blame among youth in residential care (López-Larrosa et al., 2019), while low self-esteem was found to be both prevalent, and a negative impact onquality of life among youth in residential care (Page 36)
- Schuurmans (2018)highlighted a meta-analysis that found implementing evidence informed or based models of treatmentsignificantly reduced behaviour problems compared to ‘standard’ care (Page 37)
- Lueger-Schuster et al (2018)found that maltreatment in group foster care settings varied in its impact into adulthood not only in adose- response type relationship, but also qualitatively, with sexual abuse within such institutionspredicting adult psychopathology with greater predictive power than other events. (Page 37)
- Many of theseevidenced a negative impact of residential environments on attachment styles compared to familyenvironments (Barone et al., 2016; Quiroga & Hamilton-Giachritsis, 2017; Vacaru et al., 2018), (Page 38)
- The negative psychological or psycho-social outcomes highlighted by the remaining studies include higher ADHD rates for ‘high deprivation’groups (Kennedy et al., 2016), lower verbal reasoning and attention compared to family reared children(Barone et al., 2016), lower phonological awareness, nonverbal reasoning, picture vocabulary,kindergarten readiness and pseudo-word decoding (Rakhlin et al., 2017), higher frequency of mentalhealth problems (Rodrigues et al., 2019), and lower cognitive, intellectual, and emotional functions thannon- institutionalised children (Deambrosio et al., 2017). (Page 39)
- The BEIP is a large scale, Randomised Control Trial (RCT) of children and young people who wereresident in Romanian orphanages in 2001. RCTs are the ‘gold standard’ of research methodologiesdue to their lack of potential bias’. Children in the BEIP were randomised into either the ‘Care As UsualGroup’ (CAUG) (the group who remained in institutional care), or ‘High Quality Foster Care Group’(FCG), and a comparison group of non-institutionally raised children were matched by age and gender.Measures were taken at the point of allocation, and the children were followed up at ages eight (2009),twelve (2013), and 16 (2017). (Page 41)
- 40The findings from the BEIP in relation to outcomes for children and young people who are cared forin institutional settings include:No biological differences between children who were raised in institutional environments andthose in the comparison group who had never been cared for in an institutional environment,nor with those who had been randomised to high quality foster care.Lower IQ scores for both FCG and CAUG as compared to the comparisongroup.Higher levels of callous-unemotional traits among children who experienced any institutional (Page 41)
- care as opposed to the comparison group. Those randomised to the FCG had significantlylower levels of these traits compared to the CAUG. These differences were mediated bycaregiver responsiveness to distress in boys.Children in the FCG were more likely to display adaptive functioning than those in the CAUG,with those placed into the FCG prior to age 20 months more likely to display adaptivefunctioning than those placed aged 20+ months.Slight developmental delay in processing of fearful faces in the CAUG compared to thecomparison and FCG.Higher psychopathology among those in CAUG and the FCG compared to the comparisongroup at ages 8, 12, and 16. The FCG had significantly lower psychopathology than the CAUGat age 16. Particularly high rates of attention problems, poor self-regulation, attachmentdisorders and anxiety are noted among those who experienced institutional care.Children who experienced institutional care had reduced cognitive processing speedcompared to the comparison group.Together, the studies demonstrate that while institutional care can result in significant detriment in awide range of domains, moving to high quality foster care placements can go a long way to mitigatingor entirely reversing these detriments. Throughout the studies, it is demonstrated that being removedfrom institutional care and placed in a foster care environment reduced the prevalence of psychiatricdisorders, and promoted healthy brain and socio-emotional development. (Page 42)
- Romanian orphanages being characterised as offering extremely basic care, withhigh child to caregiver ratios, minimal personalisation of experience, and ‘severe psychosocialdeprivation’ (Page 42)
- These papers highlight that children and young people in institutionalcare, and to some extent residential care, differ from the general population in their attachment styles(having in general more disorganised, or insecure attachments), and highlight that family based careis effective in reducing some of these differences.
