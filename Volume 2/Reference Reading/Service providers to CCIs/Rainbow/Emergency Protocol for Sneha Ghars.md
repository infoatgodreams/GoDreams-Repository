Context: Crisis management guidelines, again would recommend reading extensively because it applies to all homes that Rainbow runs and the hierarchy is quite clear

Crisis management framework: Prevention, preparedness, response and recovery 

Preparedness: 
Once a quarter safety audit 
Prepare crisis plan and assign roles 
Find evacuation site 500-1000 feet away for children to be moved to if needed 
Train all sneh sathis in the beginning of the year with refresher training every quarter 
Evacuation and lockdown drills regularly 

Recovery: 
Capture lessons learned and incorporate them into trainings 

In all the steps, pay close attention to the needs of children with disabilities

Crisis situations: 
Child missing: 
All children know that this is a non custodial, open gates approach and that they can leave after speaking to the sneh sathis 
Refer child to a counsellor if the child returns 
Guard posted at the gate
3 copies of the child’s photograph should be available 
Keep trees trimmed 
Death 
Prescribed places for storing dangerous items 
Train caregivers to watch out for any signs 
If it occurs inside the home, treat it like a crime scene. Please secure the scene until the police arrives 
Do not scold, hit or blame the child/perpetrator 
Do not spread panic by discussing it all with the children. Give them the basic facts only 
Repair any equipment so that the other children are not unsafe 
Report of a weapon in the home: 
Children’s lockers inspected regularly 
If a  stranger is carrying a weapon, escale immediately to the project head or the police if needed 
Fire:
Monthly fire drills conducted
Fire extinguishers in all central places 
Fire safety audit every month 
Do not use water to douche the fire unless you’ve properly determined the cause 
Natural disasters: 
Do an audit annually through appropriate civil departments 
In house checks on preparedness for natural disasters held annually, drills regularly 
Bomb threats: 
Conduct an evacuation assessment 
Call 100 and take only personal belongings available in the immediate possession of the children and staff 
Civil disturbance: 
Note possible protest sites in the neighbourhood and keep a close watch
If disturbance is imminent, close all doors except the front and main entrance doors 
Medical emergencies: 
All sneh sathis have first aid training as part of the induction 
First aid kits available and replenished regularly 
Regular medical check ups recommended 
Sexual Abuse: 
Covered in so much more detail in the child protection policy document 

Crisis Communication:
Do not release information prematurely before verifying facts 
Keep it factual, not exaggerated or minimized 
Set a communication flow for all stakeholders for each type of incident in the home 
Different stakeholders include: 
Home incharge 
Program head 
Police 
Family/Guardians 
CWC
Dept of Education 
Donors and Board 
Media communication guidelines: 
All calls from media referred to the project head first 
Do not release the names of children or any identifying information to the media without prior clearance or clear consent from the guardian and the child 
General images where the child is not identifiable does not require parental/guardian permission
If it's shot from an educational/co-curricular perspective, prior permission is not needed, as long as the video is instructional or for an extracurricular activity. 
Always do a post crisis review with all the stakeholders involved 
Important questions to ask: 
Overall, did the emergency plan work? 
What worked well, why? 
What didnt work well, why?
Was the comms timely and accurate? 
Were the stakeholders updated regularly? 
What specific problems arose? Were they resolved and if yes, how? 
Was comms ongoing until the situation was resolved? 

Annexures in the document contain evacuation, lockdown protocols + responsibilities of the project head detailed.
