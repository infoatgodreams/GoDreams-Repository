**Context**: Crisis management guidelines, again would recommend reading extensively because it applies to all homes that Rainbow runs and the hierarchy is quite clear

### Crisis management framework: Prevention, preparedness, response and recovery 
#opinion Have only included information that seems noteworthy. This will be edited soon to include all available information about the paper

## Preparedness: 
- Once a quarter safety audit 
- Prepare crisis plan and assign roles 
- Find evacuation site 500-1000 feet away for children to be moved to if needed 
- Train all caregivers in the beginning of the year with refresher training every quarter 
- Evacuation and lockdown drills regularly 

## Recovery: 
- Capture lessons learned and incorporate them into trainings 

**Important: In all the steps, pay close attention to the needs of children with disabilities

# Crisis situations: 
### Child missing: 
1. All children know that this is a non custodial, open gates approach and that they can leave after speaking to the sneh sathis 
2. Refer child to a counsellor if the child returns 
3. Guard posted at the gate
4. [Child Profile](Volume%201/Roll%20Ups/Child%20Profile.md)3 copies of the child’s photograph should be available
5. Keep trees trimmed 

### Death 
1. Prescribed places for storing dangerous items 
2. Train caregivers to watch out for any signs 
3. If it occurs inside the home, treat it like a crime scene. Please secure the scene until the police arrives 
4. Do not scold, hit or blame the child/perpetrator 
5. Do not spread panic by discussing it all with the children. Give them the basic facts only 
6. Repair any equipment so that the other children are not unsafe 

### Report of a weapon in the home: 
1. Children’s lockers inspected regularly 
2. If a  stranger is carrying a weapon, escale immediately to the project head or the police if needed 

### Fire:
1. **Monthly** fire drills conducted
2. Fire extinguishers in all central places 
3. Fire safety audit every month 
4. Do not use water to douche the fire unless you’ve properly determined the cause 

### Natural disasters: 
1. Do an audit annually through appropriate civil departments 
2. In house checks on preparedness for natural disasters held annually, drills regularly 

### Bomb threats: 
1. Conduct an evacuation assessment 
2. Call 100 and take only personal belongings available in the immediate possession of the children and staff 

### Civil disturbance: 
1. Note possible protest sites in the neighbourhood and keep a close watch
2. If disturbance is imminent, close all doors except the front and main entrance doors 

### Medical emergencies: 
1. All staff have first aid training as part of the induction 
2. First aid kits available and replenished regularly 
3. Regular medical check ups recommended 

### Sexual Abuse: 
Covered in so much more detail in the child protection policy document 

# Crisis Communication:
1. Do not release information prematurely before verifying facts 
2. Keep it factual, not exaggerated or minimized 
3. Set a communication flow for all stakeholders for each type of incident in the home 
- Different stakeholders include: 
- Home incharge 
- Program head 
- Police 
- Family/Guardians 
- CWC
- Dept of Education 
- Donors and Board 

### Media communication guidelines: 
1. All calls from media referred to the project head first 
2. Do not release the names of children or any identifying information to the media without prior clearance or clear consent from the guardian and the child 
3. General images where the child is not identifiable does not require parental/guardian permission
4. If it's shot from an educational/co-curricular perspective, prior permission is not needed, as long as the video is instructional or for an extracurricular activity. 

## Post Crisis Review: 
Important questions to ask: 
1. Overall, did the emergency plan work? 
2. What worked well, why? 
3. What didnt work well, why?
4. Was the comms timely and accurate? 
5. Were the stakeholders updated regularly? 
6. What specific problems arose? Were they resolved and if yes, how? 
7. Was comms ongoing until the situation was resolved?
