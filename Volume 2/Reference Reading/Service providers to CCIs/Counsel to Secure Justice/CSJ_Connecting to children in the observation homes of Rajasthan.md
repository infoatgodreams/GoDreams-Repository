Context: Sharing circles implemented in observation homes, wins and learnings 

**Where was it conducted? 
- Over the four-month implementation period from October 2019 to January 2020, 6 Master Trainerswere trained to facilitate circles, 75 circle processes facilitated and more than 100 children in five Observation Homes involved in these processes. (Page 2)
-  **Summary: promising findings towards helping children feel safe, developing autonomy and leadership, and developing social emotional learning including emotional awareness and coping tools (which, in turn, is linked with healthier life outcomes). (Page 5)


## What is a circle process and how was it conducted? 

Restorative circles are a talking-based activity which give participants an opportunity to speak and listen to one another in an atmosphere of safety and without hierarchy. (Page 11)
- Circle processes –a talking-based activity where participants sit in a circle facing each other. Each participant gets an opportunity to speak sequentially. While one person is speaking, others listen to them without interrupting.
- Circle facilitators/keepers – one or two individuals who facilitate the circle processes.They ask questions which guide the discussion but, apart from that, participate in equal ways as other in the circle.
- Master Trainers – six designated individuals trained during this project to facilitate restorative circles. (Page 5)
- 5 Master Trainers were involved in circle processes as shadow facilitators, i.e., they got an opportunity to see CSJ staff hold circles. Each Master Trainer was given at least 3 shadow facilitation opportunities with CSJ facilitating a total of 21 circles for shadow facilitation. The opportunity of being a shadow facilitator enables individuals to: (Page 6)
-  Number of circles in which CSJ provided shadow facilitation opportunities - 21
-  Number of circles in which CSJ staff were present for guidance and hand holding- 10  (Page 7)

### Steps involved:

- Children sit in a circular formation facing each otherso that each person can see the others. (Page 13)
- Two circle keepers facilitate the process and are also referred to as co-facilitators. (Page 13)
- Circles use a talking piece, any object which is passed around from one person to the other sequentially (Wilbur, Wilbur, Garrett, & Yuhas, 2001).Each person gets the opportunity to share when they hold the talking piece, while all others are invited to listen to them. (Page 13)
- Circles use a sequential format, where one person speaks at a time, and the opportunity to speak moves in one direction around the circle. Each person must wait to speak until their turn, and no one may interrupt while another person is speaking. (Page 14)
- Circles reflect Vygotsky’s constructivist theory of learning, i.e., children learn from their surroundings when the environment is inclusive and supportive (Page 14)
- Circles are designed in a structured way, planned once a week on a specific day with a specific plan (Mosley, 2016). Each circle plan has distinct stages, with each stage having a predetermined purpose which allow children to feel safe, comfortable, talk, and experience enjoyment. (Page 14)
- No one is judged based on their performance or the extent of their involvement. (Page 15)
- All participants are told that participation is voluntary and that they can leave at any time. (Page 15)
-  For restorative circles to realize their full potential,it is crucial that the restorative environment extends beyond the circles conducted by MasterTrainers to the environment in the Observation Home, and, ultimately, to their families. (Page 32)
- The whole-institution model will help achieve lasting change that enhances and builds relationships between children, staff, parents, improves healthy behaviour, reduces violence and bullying (Page 32)


### Training process
1. experience the circle process.
2. learn techniques and skills used to keep the circle.
3. learn techniques to handle challenging situations.
4. learn and experience debriefing techniques and skills. (Page 7)

## Objectives of the intervention

a) reduce the adverse impact of institutionalization and 
b) build positive impact through promoting social emotional learning. 
The goal of this intervention is to promote social reintegration and rehabilitation for children inObservation Homes. (Page 10)

**Detailed goals**
- "knowledge, attitudes, and skills to understand and manage emotions, set and achieve positive goals, feel and show empathy for others, establish and maintain positive relationships, and make responsible decisions" (Page 11)
- five components of social emotional learning are: self-awareness; self-management; social awareness; relationship skills; and responsible decision-making. (Page 11)
- Young girls with low self-esteem began perceiving themselves as more competent and confident after participating in circles (Page 12)
- Boys with emotional and behavioral disorders showed improved behavior after participating in circles (Page 12)
- improving social emotional learning skills (Page 12)
- empathy for any person they may have harmed (Page 12)
- empathy for their own families by thinking through the impact on them. (Page 12)
- a sense of accountability: (Page 12)
- reducing bullying and violence within the home (Page 12)
- change in harmful belief patterns. (Page 12)


### Mental Health effects of institutionalization
- The psychological effect of institutionalisation on children can be severe because of the-isolation from the family and community within the institutional setting. Many children-develop long-term mental health difficulties including depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation (Ståhlberg,  Anckarsäter, & Nilsson, 2010). (Page 10)
- The family’s anger at the child owing to their actions often strains their relationship. In addition, the limited time for meeting with the child, which requires significant time and monetary investment, further builds anger and resentment and frequently impacts relationships (Page 10)
- Institutionalisation may influence the children adversely as they come into contact with-others who may be part of criminal gangs or may have knowledge on weapons, tools, methods for committing wrongs (Page 11)
- Stigma and shame (for the child and the family) arise from being involved with the legal system (Page 11)

## Learnings from the process:
- Over four months of circle processes, children have become equipped to identify emotions usingtangible tools such as feeling charts and emotion temperature scales. (Page 15)
- Feeling charts provide pictorial representations of different emotions in the form of emoticons. (Page 16)
- Children were able to identify a wide spectrum of emotions (Page 16)
- Crucial learning for children as it helps them to understand that the emotions are transient and do not have to control them or their behaviour. This helps children develop more control over their emotions. (Page 17)
- Circles helped children think through how their emotions are separate from their behaviours, and behaviours do not need to be driven by emotions (Page 19)
- Along with identifying emotions, children indicated an understanding of how emotional experiences can vary in intensity. Art based tools are helpful for children to understand this variance in intensity of emotions (Page 19)
- Circles prompted children to think through tools they can use to cope with emotions. (Page 20)
- Children were offered space to practice multiple relaxation and calming strategies. (Page 21)
- After participating in the circles and discussing the impact of varied emotions, children have effectively identified how others may be feeling based on a spectrum of facial expressions. (Page 22)
- Specific circles focused on experiences of discrimination. (Page 24)
- Children recognizing these gender stereotypes as social constructs paves the way for them to understand their role in perpetuating these, as well as in the adverse impact of these stereotypes on them (Page 26)
- During the circles, there was an observable change in children’s way of communicating with each other. Owing to the talking piece, children began practicing listening, and not interrupting while others were speaking. Children also participated in collective story building in each circle. (Page 26)
- The fear of stigma ran deep in children, and was reflected even during other rounds, wherein children would talk about how stigma would impact their self-worth. (Page 27)
- While identifying their social support, children were simultaneously encouraged to think of how their actions had impacted others. The circle processes guided children towards exploring how others feel, including as a result of their own actions. (Page 27)
- Participating in circle activities as well as discussions helps children develop self-esteem, self-confidence in addition to other social emotional skills (Page 28)
- Children increasingly felt comfortable voicing themselves and their opinion in the circle, including expressing actions/thoughts which may not be perceived as socially desirable. (Page 28)
- children space to think through their strengths and build on these. This allows children to believe that they have something to offer and achieve (Holcomb-McCoy, 2007). (Page 29)
