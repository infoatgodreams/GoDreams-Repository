Context: Sharing circles implemented in observation homes, wins and learnings 

**Where was it conducted? **
- Over the four-month implementation period from October 2019 to January 2020, 6 Master Trainerswere trained to facilitate circles, 75 circle processes facilitated and more than 100 children in five Observation Homes involved in these processes. (Page 2)

## What is a circle process and how was it conducted? **

Restorative circles are a talking-based activity which give participants an opportunity to speak and listen to one another in an atmosphere of safety and without hierarchy. (Page 11)
- Circle processes –a talking-based activity where participants sit in a circle facing each other. Each participant gets an opportunity to speak sequentially. While one person is speaking, others listen to them without interrupting.
- Circle facilitators/keepers – one or two individuals who facilitate the circle processes.They ask questions which guide the discussion but, apart from that, participate in equal ways as other in the circle.
- Master Trainers – six designated individuals trained during this project to facilitate restorative circles. (Page 5)
- 5 Master Trainers were involved in circle processes as shadow facilitators, i.e., they got an opportunity to see CSJ staff hold circles. Each Master Trainer was given at least 3 shadow facilitation opportunities with CSJ facilitating a total of 21 circles for shadow facilitation. The opportunity of being a shadow facilitator enables individuals to: (Page 6)
- - Number of circles in which CSJ provided shadow facilitation opportunities - 21
-  Number of circles in which CSJ staff were present for guidance and hand holding- 10  (Page 7)

 **Summary: promising findings towards helping children feel safe, developing autonomy and leadership, and developing social emotional learning including emotional awareness and coping tools (which, in turn, is linked with healthier life outcomes). (Page 5)

### Training process
1. experience the circle process.
2. learn techniques and skills used to keep the circle.
3. learn techniques to handle challenging situations.
4. learn and experience debriefing techniques and skills. (Page 7)

## Objectives of the intervention

a) reduce the adverse impact of institutionalization and 
b) build positive impact through promoting social emotional learning. 
The goal of this intervention is to promote social reintegration and rehabilitation for children inObservation Homes. (Page 10)

**Detailed goals**
- "knowledge, attitudes, and skills to understand and manage emotions, set and achieve positive goals, feel and show empathy for others, establish and maintain positive relationships, and make responsible decisions" (Page 11)
- five components of social emotional learning are: self-awareness; self-management; social awareness; relationship skills; and responsible decision-making. (Page 11)
- Young girls with low self-esteem began perceiving themselves as more competent and confident after participating in circles (Page 12)
- Boys with emotional and behavioral disorders showed improved behavior after participating in circles (Page 12)
- improving social emotional learning skills (Page 12)
- empathy for any person they may have harmed (Page 12)
- empathy for their own families by thinking through the impact on them. (Page 12)
- a sense of accountability: (Page 12)
- reducing bullying and violence within the home (Page 12)
- change in harmful belief patterns. (Page 12)


### Mental Health effects of institutionalization
- The psychological effect of institutionalisation on children can be severe because of the-isolation from the family and community within the institutional setting. Many children-develop long-term mental health difficulties including depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation (Ståhlberg,  Anckarsäter, & Nilsson, 2010). (Page 10)
- The family’s anger at the child owing to their actions often strains their relationship. In addition, the limited time for meeting with the child, which requires significant time and monetary investment, further builds anger and resentment and frequently impacts relationships (Page 10)
- Institutionalisation may influence the children adversely as they come into contact with-others who may be part of criminal gangs or may have knowledge on weapons, tools, methods for committing wrongs (Page 11)
- Stigma and shame (for the child and the family) arise from being involved with the legal system (Page 11)


- Children sit in a circular formation facing each otherso that each person can see the others. (Page 13)
- Two circle keepers facilitate theprocess and are also referred to as co-facilitators. (Page 13)
- Circles use a talking piece, any object which is passed around from oneperson to the other sequentially (Wilbur, Wilbur, Garrett, & Yuhas, 2001).Each person gets the opportunity to share when they hold the talking piece,while all others are invited to listen to them. (Page 13)
- Circles use a sequential format, where one person speaks at a time, and the opportunity to speakmoves in one direction around the circle. Each person must wait to speak until their turn, and noone may interrupt while another person is speaking. (Page 14)
- Circles reflect Vygotsky’s constructivist theory oflearning, i.e., children learn from their surroundingswhen the environment is inclusive and supportive (Page 14)
- Circles are designed in a structured way, planned once a week on a specific day with a specificplan (Mosley, 2016). Each circle plan has distinct stages, with each stage having a predeterminedpurpose which allow children to feel safe, comfortable, talk, and experience enjoyment. (Page 14)
- No one is judged basedon their performance or the extent of their involvement. (Page 15)
- All participants are told that participation is voluntary and that they can leave at any time. (Page 15)
- Over four months of circle processes, children have become equipped to identify emotions usingtangible tools such as feeling charts and emotion temperature scales. (Page 15)
- Feeling charts provide pictorial representations of different emotions in the form of emoticons. (Page 16)
- Children were able to identify a wide spectrumof emotions (Page 16)
- crucial learning for children as it helps them to understand that the emotions aretransient and do not have to control them or their behaviour. This helps children develop morecontrol over their emotions. (Page 17)
- Circles helped children think through how their emotions areseparate from their behaviours, and behaviours do not need to bedriven by emotions (Page 19)
- Along with identifying emotions, children indicatedan understanding of how emotional experiences canvary in intensity. Art based tools are helpful forchildren to understand this variance in intensity ofemotions (Page 19)
- Children who have lowerawareness of emotional experiences demonstrate adiminished ability to cope with difficult emotions andsituations (Kranzler, et al., 2016). On the other hand,being able to effectively identify one’s emotions enablesone to develop mechanisms which regulate theseemotions (Barrett, Gross, Christensen, & Benvenuto,2001). (Page 20)
- Circles prompted children to think through tools they can use to cope with emotions. (Page 20)
- Children wereoffered space to practice multiple relaxation and calmingstrategies. (Page 21)
- Afterparticipating in the circles and discussing the impact of varied emotions, children have effectivelyidentified how others may be feeling based on a spectrum of facial expressions. (Page 22)
- Sspecific circles focused on experiences of discrimination. (Page 24)
- Children recognizing these gender stereotypes as social constructs paves the way for them tounderstand their role in perpetuating these, as well as in the adverse impact of these stereotypes onthem (Page 26)
- During the circles, there was an observable change in children’s way of communicating witheach other. Owing to the talking piece, children began practicing listening, and not interruptingwhile others were speaking. Children also participated in collective story building in each circle. (Page 26)
- The fear of stigma randeep in children, and was reflected even during otherrounds, wherein children would talk about howstigma would impact their self-worth. (Page 27)
- Children with strong socialsupport networks show better mental health, higher self-esteem, improved behavior as well asreduces the possibility of them being at-risk (Culpepper, 2014). However, as many parents areangry at the children it severely disrupts the relationships and impacts their social support. (Page 27)
- While identifying their social support, children weresimultaneously encouraged to think of how their actions hadimpacted others. The circle processes guided children towardsexploring how others feel, including as a result of their ownactions. (Page 27)
- Participating in circle activities as well as discussions helpschildren develop self-esteem, self-confidence in addition to other social emotional skills (Page 28)
- Children increasingly felt comfortablevoicing themselves and their opinion in thecircle, including expressing actions/thoughts which may not be perceived associally desirable. (Page 28)
- 27circles provided (Page 28)
- children space to think through their strengths and build on these. This allows children to believethat they have something to offer and achieve (Holcomb-McCoy, 2007). (Page 29)
- For restorative circles to realize their full potential,it is crucial that the restorative environment extends beyond the circles conducted by MasterTrainers to the environment in the Observation Home, and, ultimately, to their families. (Page 32)
- . The whole-institution model will help achieve lasting change that enhances and buildsrelationships between children, staff, parents, improves healthy behaviour, reduces violence andbullying (Page 32)
