Context: This cross-sectional, study which was conducted at AJ Institute of Medical Sciences, Mangalore, Karnataka, India in the months of July-August 2013 included 70 children (aged between 6-16 years) of which 35 were selected from orphanages and the other 35 served as control (age-matched non-orphans).

# Assessment tools
- Their anthropometric measurements (height, weight, and BMI) were measured and cognition was assessed using subsets of Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R): Block design and Digit span.
- Highlight page 1: The WHO has developed child growth standards which describe how a child should grow, and the growth standards are used to identify children who are over-nourished or under-nourished. A child is diagnosed as having under-nutrition when the child’s height or length (stunted), weight (underweight), or weight-for-height (wasted) is well below the mean on the growth standards for his or her age [4].
- Highlight page 1: The Wechsler scales continues to be the most widely used intelligence batteries. The concepts, methods, and procedures inherent in the design of the Wechsler scales have been so influential that they have guided most of the test development and research in the field for more than a half century Block design and Digit span are two subsets of the Wechsler scales which test the perceptual reasoning and working memory, respectively.
- Highlight page 2: Self-structured questionnaire was divided into following categories:
	- A. General information: Included the name, age, gender, education, and history of past/present medical or surgical illness of child;
	- B. Anthropometric measurements: Included height (recorded in centimetresusing a stadiometer (range 60 cm-200 cm) with an accuracy of 0.1 cm), weight (recorded in kilograms to the nearest 0.1 Kg using mechanical weighing scale), and body mass index (kilograms/metre2)

# Negative impact of institutionalisation
- Highlight page 1: There is accumulating evidence that early malnutrition, marked by stunting, is associated with long-term deficits in cognitive and academic performance, even when social and psychological differences are controlled.
- Highlight page 3: In the present study, overall, 37·1% of children had stunting (inadequate HAZ), 31·4% had wasting (inadequate WAZ), 45·7% were underweight (inadequate WHZ), and 34·3% showed thinness (low BAZ) i.e., below the WHO/NCHS growth standards (Z-score below -2). Nutritional status was also compared in orphans and non-orphans wherein the prevalence of under-nutrition was more in orphans and Z-scores were significantly less in orphans than non- orphans 
- Highlight page 3  Cognition, when compared , revealed that the cognitive scores were significantly less in orphans compared to non-orphans (p<0·05) and there was a moderate positive correlation between cognitive scores with that of nutritional anthropometric indices based on Z-scores in the orphans 
- Highlight page 3: A study conducted in 2001 on children growing up in orphanages showed a substantial delay in IQ (Intelligence Quotient) assessed using WISC when compared with children reared in (foster or biological) families. Similar results were obtained by Alaimo K et al., Suboticanec BK et al., and Kar BR et al., who indicated severity of malnutrition has greater impact on cognitive performance of the children 
- Highlight page 3: . Because of care in large groups and poor environments, brain development may become delayed during the formative period after birth and the lack of challenging stimuli and stable attachments may impair the intellectual development of institutionalized children.
-  This study concludes that the nutritional status of the institutionalized orphans of Mangalore aged between 6-16 years had high rates of both malnutrition and cognitive delay compared to the non-orphans and there was a direct correlation between both the variables…
