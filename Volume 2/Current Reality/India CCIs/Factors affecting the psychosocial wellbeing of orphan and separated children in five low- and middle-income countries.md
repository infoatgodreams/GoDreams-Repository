Brief: This study was designed to (1) examine if the psychosocial well-being of OSC in underresourced societies in LMICs is more dependent on the availability of certain components of quality of care rather than the care setting itself (i.e. the residential care-based or community family-based setting), and (2) identify the relative significance of certain components of quality of care that are associated with a child’s psychosocial well-being across different OSC care settings

# Study Design 
 - This study drew from 36-month follow-up data from the Positive Outcomes for Orphans (POFO) Study and used a sample population of 2,013 (923 institution- and 1,090 community-based) OSC among six diverse study sites across five LMICs: Cambodia, India (Hyderabad and Nagaland), Kenya, Tanzania, and Ethiopia.
 - Children were enrolled between 2006 and 2008 and followed biannually. Using the 36-month follow-up data, a total of 2,013 (923 residential care-based and 1,090 community-based) OSC study participants from all six sites were available for analysis.
 - The POFO study employed a two-stage random sampling methodology to identify a representative sample of 1,357 OSC living in residential care settings and 1,480 OSC living in community-based settings.


# Concerns with existing literature 
 
 - Several oft-cited studies of infant children who lived in socially and emotionally deprived institutions in Europe have concluded that institutional care is damaging to the development of young children relative to community-based foster care. 
 - Indeed, some studies demonstrated powerful negative effects of deprivation on infant development, and positive development when the infants were moved to live with welltrained and paid foster parents.
 - These studies of infants in a very specific and negative caregiving environment have been generalized to a belief that all residential care settings across the world must have the same poor caregiving characteristics: high child-to-caregiver ratios, shift work, low compensation for caregivers, regimented and non-individualized care, and a lack of psychological investment in the children
 - 

# Study findings:
- Whetten et al.found that children in residential care centers across five LMICs (Cambodia, India, Kenya, Tanzania, and Ethiopia) fared better than those in community settings on several outcomes, including physical health, behavioral and emotional health, intellectual functioning, and memory. They also reported great variability between individuals within care settings (larger than variability between sites or variability between care settings within a site), and after adjusting for sites, age, and gender, discovered that residential care vs. community-based care settings explained only 0.3–7% of the variability in child outcomes.
- Thus, the development of positive child outcomes (such as psychosocial well-being) may not be heavily dependent on membership in a community-based setting like a Western-style nuclear family. It may instead be dependent primarily on the availability of certain components of quality of care rather than the living environment itself where OSC receive care.
- Child psychosocial well-being across “high” and “low” levels of quality of care showed negligible differences between residential- and community-based care settings, suggesting the important factor in child well-being is quality of care rather than setting of care
-  Importantly, child psychosocial well-being did not vary by residential vs. family-based care within levels of high- and low-quality care.
- Findings suggested that higher levels of all four components of quality of care (food security, quality of shelter, quality of caregiving, and access to health care services) significantly predicted more positive psychosocial well-being. Compared to the 0% variance explained by care setting in this current model, food security explained 13.4% of the variance in psychosocial well-being, while quality of shelter explained 10%, quality of caregiving explained 8.9%, and access to health care services explained 7.3%. Moreover, mean SDQ total difficulties scores across “high” and “low” levels of quality of care showed differences between care settings to be minimal, and are therefore considered null results.
- Moreover, findings from this study suggest that in this study’s population across five LMICs, the psychosocial well-being of OSC in residential care settings (as measured by the SDQ) is no different from that of their community-based counterparts, and it is the availability of certain components of quality of care within the settings that make a difference. These findings should not be taken to mean that residential care settings are the better care setting for OSC, but rather that community-based care settings may perhaps not be all that different when it comes to predicting child psychosocial well-being. Given this, it is crucial that stakeholders create policies and practices that effectively support the improvement of quality of care across all OSC care settings.
- Additionally, these findings offer a better understanding of where to intervene to improve orphan psychosocial well-being and suggest a focus on certain components of quality of care, such as food security, quality of shelter, quality of caregiving, and access to health care services.


# Assessment tools [[Assessment Tools]]

- Assessment of components of quality of care: The Child Status Index (CSI). The Child Status Index (CSI) was developed as an easy-to-use tool to assess children’s current needs, monitor improvements in specific dimensions of child well-being, and identify areas of concern that can be served by program interventions
- The tool is based on several child-centered and broader environmental factors and was organized under six domains: Food and Nutrition; Shelter and Care; Protection; Health; Psychosocial; and Education and Skills Training. For each domain, there are two different factors that represent potential areas of concern, and which may be modifiable with additional resources.
- CSI, the following four factors were used for analysis based on their relevance to the “components of quality of care” construct, the expert recommendation of the CSI creator, as well as empirical evidence that suggests their potential effects on OSC care settings. 
	- CSI factor 1: Food security. The goal of this factor was for the child to have sufficient and nutritious food at all times of the year to grow well and to have an active and healthy life. “Food Security” was defined as: “the ability of the household or institution to obtain and provide enough food for the child. This food should be obtained through socially acceptable ways, without resorting to emergency food supplies, scavenging, begging, stealing, or other coping strategies”.
	- CSI factor 3: Shelter. The goal of this factor was for the child to have a stable shelter that is adequate, dry, and safe. “Shelter” describes “the physical place or structure of the home or institution where the child lives and the extent to which the structure provides security, comfort and protection from weather. Stability is defined in terms of living in the same place for at least the past six months”.
	- CSI factor 4: Caregiving. The goal of this factor was for the child to have at least one adult (age 18 or over) who provides consistent care, attention, and support. Caregiving was “seen as good when there is an identified adult (parent or guardian) who provides the child with a stable, nurturing, and emotionally secure environment. The relationship between the child and the caregiver should provide physical and psychological security for the child. This factor captured how committed the caregiver was to the child and to his/her involvement with the child”.
	-  CSI factor 8: Health care services. The goal of this factor was for the child to have access to health care services, including preventive care and medical treatment when ill. Adequate “health care services” was defined as “a child’s access to basic health care services that were age-appropriate, including immunizations (for children under five), bed nets, health education (e.g., HIV prevention for youth), other preventive measures, and appropriate medical care and medicines when sick”.
	- Child psychosocial well-being. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) self-report was administered to children aged 10 and older. This brief behavioral screening tool (applicable for children 3–16 years old) was used to assess behavioral and emotional difficulties. The four difficulties subscales of the SDQ (emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention; peer relationship) can be summed to create a total difficulties score. There were 5 items in each subscale, and each item was scored from 0–2.

# Limitations of the study

- Several limitations should also be noted. Although the study included diverse LMICs, there is no representation from South America or Eastern Europe, where much of the earlier research on residential care originated. 
- Recognizing that contexts are not necessarily interchangeable, continued study should focus on inclusion of other cultural contexts not represented in this study. Another limitation of this analysis involves the range of variables examined. 
- Research suggests that there are other possible factors and characteristics that are significantly associated with OSC psychosocial well-being that were not included in this analysis, such as prevalence and incidence of trauma[47], school attendance[48,49], experience of HIV/AIDS stigma[50], socioeconomic status[51], caregiver health[52], or socio-cultural settings. 
- Accordingly, it is possible that components of quality of care may act in tandem with other factors which influence psychosocial well-being, and further research is needed to tease out these relationships.
