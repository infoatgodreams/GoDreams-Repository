## Scope:
This paper considers research into the use of institutional care in terms of cognitive development for the  very  young  children  in  the  states  of  North - West  India. Cross – sectional  data  on  504 institutionalized and 570 controls (including both the sexes) aged 11 to 17 years were collected. 

## Previous research suggestive of negative impacts of institutionalisation

- Lower IQ scores were found by Stock and Smythe (1976), Sloutsky (1 997) (in 6 to 7 year old children reared in a Russian orphanage compared to ones residing at homes), Bower (1999) and Chugani et al. (2001). Castle et al. (1999) concluded that higher the rating of psychological deprivation, lower the IQ scores in 129 Roma nian orphans. 
- Morison and Ellwood (2000) evaluated children's intellectual development using Stanford - Binet Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition. They found a clear distinction among the groups, in which the Canadian – born group scored highest (M=109), the early - adopted children scored in the middle (M=99), and the orphanage ones scored lowest (M=91). The orphanage children adopted at later ages (24 - 60 months old) had the lowest IQs of all (M=68). 
- Spitz (1945) reported that by the end of second year of institutional care, the DQs had reduced to a low of 45, compared t o an average DQ of 100. Goldfarb (1945, 1955) on comparison of 15 children residing in orphanages with those placed in foster care found that even in adolescence, the institutionalized group was intellectually delayed. 
	- An increase by 37 points in average I Q in the orphanage children who were placed in personalized care and decrease by 21 points in those who remained in the orphanages was observed by Skeels (1966). 
- Dennis (1973) followed children from a Lebanese orphanage after they were adopted at different ages. He concluded that children who had been adopted before 2 years of age eventually regained normal IQs whereas ones being adopted after 2 years of age showed permanent deficits in IQ. 

## Proof from this study on the negative impact of institutionalisation on IQ

- On the basis of categorization of IQ, the institut ionalized males as well as females were lesser in number than their control counterparts from genius to below normal category. Thereafter they outnumbered the controls. 
- More than half of the institutionalized subjects were significantly below the average I Q levels (IQ below 70). The differences between the two groups were statistically significant 
- With the increase in age, the number of institutionalized subjects in the average intelligence category goes on decreasing and the number goes on increasing towards the intellectually impaire d category. 
- It can be elucidated that there was a backlog in intellectual development in the institutionalized adolescents compared to their control counterparts. More than half of the institutionalized adolescents were definitely far below in intelligence on the basis of IQ categorization. 

## Reasons for lower IQ in institutionalised children

- The lag in cognitive development may be due to institutionalized factors like low nutritional status; larger individual : caregiver ratio ; round the clock stress; lack of opportunities, exposure, stimulation, optimisti c approach towards life, zeal to build up one's mental ability; social deficits and stigma.
