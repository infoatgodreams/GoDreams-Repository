Context: 
 
 *Highlight [page 1]:* Keeping this in view present study was conducted in two orphanages of New Delhi, India during August-December 2016 in order to understand living conditions, education, nutrition, networking, and wellbeing of orphan children. For this paper we limited our study to psychological wellbeing of orphan children and various coping mechanisms adopted by them. 15 children aged 10-17 years were randomly selected for in-depth interviews.

 *Highlight [page 2]:* Statistics show that India is home for the 30 million orphan and vulnerable children (OVC), the largest in the South Asian region

 *Highlight [page 4]:* . The inclusion- criteria were: 1) children of age 10-17 years; 2) living in the orphanage for past one year; and 3) willing to participate in the current research.

 *Highlight [page 4]:* A semi-structured open-ended guideline was used to gather data from respondents. This guideline covered information of children’s background, their admission in the orphanage, education, nutrition and physical, psychological and social wellbeing

 *Highlight [page 5]:* Most children were happy to be in the orphanage because they not only got access to food, clothing, and shelter but also to the health and educational facilities. 

 *Highlight [page 6]:* On the contrary few children expressed their grief over residing in the orphanage. They criticized the sub-standard conditions of the orphanage and poor quality of facilities

# Psychological problems

 *Highlight [page 6]:* Depression and stress: study revealed that the majority of children felt sad and depressed due to their stay in the orphanage and also due to parental bereavement

 *Highlight [page 6]:* Low self-esteem and purpose: children reported low levels of self-esteem and lacked purpose in life. The majority of children felt they were worthless and good for nothing.

 *Highlight [page 7]:* Loneliness and helplessness: in-depth interviews of participants reflected that most of them were lonely and often felt helpless. Two boys told (12-year-old and 10-year-old) stated that, “We feel we are a burden on others. Nobody is interested to know how was our day at school or how we are feeling. No one bothers about us.”

 *Highlight [page 7]:* Love and affection: Results also indicated that due to parental bereavement children were longing for love and affection especially the younger ones; they would not understand why they ended up living in an orphanage.

 *Highlight [page 8]:* The majority of children stated that they still miss their parents and often have a problem falling asleep due to their memories. Seeing other kids with parents often reminded them of their families

 *Highlight [page 8]:* Social issues

 *Highlight [page 8]:* Behavioral disorders:

 *Highlight [page 8]:* Others reported that they refrained from interacting with any outsider because they didn’t know what to say and hesitated to put forth their opinions. Attachment disorders were also reported among participants.

 *Highlight [page 8]:* Lack of guidance: the majority of OVC reported that they lack adult guidance and advocacy. Although children were going to school, they didn’t know what to do afterward or what they will do once they go out of the orphanage

 *Highlight [page 9]:* Rejection: children staying in orphanages often feel rejected and disowned by own people. These dejected children enter children homes which in no ways can replace familial love and affection.

 *Highlight [page 9]:* Recognition and approval: most of the times OVC have to experience stigmatization by society.

 *Highlight [page 9]:* Many children reported their concern about whether they will be able to fit in the society or more so be accepted by the society.

 *Highlight [page 9]:* Security: these children lead a stressful life, and once they go out of orphanage they are likely to slip into poverty. They don’t have any special training or any assurance of a job

 *Highlight [page 10]:* Isolation: this was the most common problem of children living in institutional care. Most of them felt that they were free enough to interact with people outside the orphanage.

 *Highlight [page 10]:* Coping strategies Children used different coping strategies to deal with psychosocial issues they faced on a day-to-day basis as discussed below. i. Spiritual approach: Most of the children reported that whenever they are worried or upset about something they prayed to the God. They said that they often complained to the God about the hardships of life and felt better.

 *Highlight [page 10]:* ii. Supporting inmates: the majority of children said they whenever some children have a problem especially younger ones we try to solve it and support them.

 *Highlight [page 10]:* iii. Suppressing feelings: it was found that while most of the children yearned for their parents, some considered that actively suppressing feelings and forgetting about problems associated with parents is the key to psychological recovery and happines

 *Highlight [page 10]:* iv. Shifting focus to other activities: many children reported that whenever they felt down, they tried to focus on something else like any activity which made them happy like playing with other inmates, studying, watching television or simply by going to sleep.

 *Highlight [page 11]:* v. Substance abuse some older children accepted that many times they smoked and chewed tobacco to avoid tension and be carefree. Some other reported that they often used pain relieving balms as inhalants to relieve tension and anxiety. vi. Self-discrimination: these practices were more common among younger children or those who were new to the atmosphere of the orphanage they often sit alone, cry a lot, skip meals and isolate themselves which was harmful to their wellbeing. vii. Misbehavior: some children accepted that whenever they are stressed, they get irritated very easily on small things and felt agitated and therefore, took out their anger on fellow children and sometimes even on the caregivers. viii. Detachment: some children also reported that to keep the emotions at bay they try not to be sentimental or emotionally attached to people around them. They feel that detachment from others would save and secure them from getting hurt.

 *Highlight [page 11]:* Even if all the socio-economic factors shaping child’s development and achievement are taken out of the equation, parental involvement during the transition from childhood to adolescence and adulthood remains an important predictor of child’s social well-being [36]
