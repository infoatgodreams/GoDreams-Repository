### Challenges faced by children

- Children do not have basic certificates which proves their age, birth place, and caste etc.
  - This makes it difficulty to obtain other important documents such as driving license, Passport, Aadhar card, bank account etc
- Lack of facilities for special need children such as a counsellor or relevant medical facilities.
- The awareness regarding the social security schemes implemented by Central and State Governments which may support in getting these children in need better employment opportunities and other social benefits is low.
- As CLs have been living with minimum interaction with the society, they are also worried to face the world after they leave the home
- The schools and colleges do not have a system for reservation of seats for disadvantaged/orphan children
- The budget of ICPS scheme has not been revised from past 6 years.
- In the Aftercare home there is no permanent counsellor to conduct regular sessions, but in case of requirement, children are taken to a private counsellor.
- There is a good tracking system for the Care Leavers but is not strongly implemented for aftercare adults mainly above 23 or 25 years of age.
- The children (who are between the age of 16-18) feel that they should have a personal mobile phone.

### Challenges at the system/institution level

- The officials who are aware of the functioning of the CCI and their challenges, often get transferred and replaced by a new officer who has no knowledge on the functioning of the CCIs, to make the decisions
- According to the Sponsorship programme under ICPS Scheme, if any child is being migrated from one State to another while he/she is getting a scholarship, then the sponsorship is transferred to the concerned CWC belonging to the State to which the child is being transferred. But the implementation is very poor.
- As there is lack of special needs facilities, it is difficult for them to transfer such children to a facility where there is a provision for special facilities/medical needs.
- If the child runs away, the CCI rescues it and as per the rules, they send him/her to the concerned CWC in their district, which sends the child back to the home, without considering if the parents are capable to rise the child, or if there is a child- friendly environment in the family.

### Recommendations Proposed

- Strengthening the exit plan for children leaving CCIs
- The government support should extend to Rs. 5000 per child per month instead of existing Rs. 2000
- Support by the government in issuance of basic documents like ID cards, Voter ID, Aadhar card etc. to enable them to get Driving Licence, Passport, Bank account etc.
- Vocational courses should be developed in accordance with the potential and desires of the children; these should reflect the demands of the labour market
- Child budgeting is most essential special with special focus on child care institutions and aftercare services.
  - The budget should include operational parts such as children education, mental health support, computer education, life skill trainings etc.

- Periodic census or survey of vulnerable children &amp; orphans would to draw up more realistic and meaningful plans and programmes for the needy children. It is useful for deciding eligibility and entitlements under various schemes
- More clarity should be addressed in the regulatory aftercare framework
- There is a need to consider reservations for orphans in the government jobs.
- Govt should establish more CCIs/shelters/orphanages/Aftercare hostels in the state since there is a shortage.
- Government should extend financial support to the CCIs for maintenance and operation support required by CCIs
  - at least 75 percent the financial support to the CCIs required to buy Computers, Television

- A dedicated Aftercare Policy for Orphan and Abandoned Children is required

- Strong Information, education and communication related to the legal awareness needs to be built among orphans, their guardians as well as in institutions about the rights and entitlements of orphans.
- Institutional capacities and a manual should be developed to allow for systematic monitoring and follow-up of young people leaving care.
- An NGO network and coalition should be established in the State to defend and protect care leavers&#39; rights
- Professional community support services such as youth clubs and psycho-social centres should be made accessible to care leavers.
- Affordable and adequate housing: State government should accord high priority to finding affordable and adequate housing and encourage NGOs to set up Aftercare Hostels /group housing facilities, particularly at District places
- Subsidised utility charges and Phone services for careleavers
- As there are many cases where families do not accept their child due to social and financial challenges, a new programme is to be introduced, in such cases, where families need to be strengthened for the welfare of their children
