## Scope:
Purpose of the current article is to assess the relevance of Western youth development models to adolescents in institutional care in India. The authors review three frameworks for positive youth development, present a critical literature review on youth in institutional care, and situate results within relevant cultural, historic and socioeconomic contexts in India. 

# Youth Development Models
- As young people are embedded in relationships and institutions, this article considers three youth developmental frameworks at the individual, social and institutional levels. The young adult success framework (Nagaoka  et al. , 2015) identifies individual factors and experiences necessary for a successful transition into adulthood. 
- The developmental relationships framework (Pekel et al. , 2015)describes the interactions with adults that will foster these kinds of experiences. 
- A third framework describes developmental settings, which characterises the institutional environment where these experiences and relationships occur (National Research Council [NRC] and Institute of Medicine [IOM], 2002) 


## Factors And Foundations: What Do Young People Need To Develop? 
- The young adult success model posits three factors that are most directly related to positive outcomes in young adulthood: 
	- (1) competencies, complex sets of abilities that allow individuals to perform roles, navigate contexts and adapt to different needs and demands
	-  (2) integrated identity, a coherent sense of self across time, contexts and include multiple aspects of one’s identity and
	- (3) agency, the ability to determine one’s own life path rather than being subject to external forces (Nagaoka et al. , 2015). 
	- Each complex factor relies on four underlying foundational components that youth must develop: 
		- (1) knowledge and skills, 
		- (2) mindsets, 
		- (3) values and
		(4) self- regulation. 

## Developmental Experiences: 
- How Do Young People Develop? Developmental experiences can help foster these factors and foundational components and have two alternating phases –action and reflection. 
- First, young people need an opportunity to engage in concrete and meaningful action.
- Examples include opportunities to encounter new people and places, being able to experiment with new skills or activities, making active choices between developmentally appropriate options, practicing skills or contributing to one’s community (Nagaoka et al. , 2015). 
- However, it is not action alone that develops factors and foundational components, but also the meaning that a young person makes of that action through reflection. As reflection will happen instinctually, practitioners can best serve youth by intentionally structuring opportunities for youth reflection. 

## Developmental relationships (Pekel et al. , 2015)
- can help young people use experiences to develop their competencies, integrated identity and agency. In these relationships, adults must express care, challenge growth, provide support, share power and expand possibilities. 
- Expressing care includes listening, demonstrating affection, demonstrating interest and being dependable for the young person. 

## Developmental Settings: 
- Where Do Young People Develop? 
- Developmental settings, which best facilitate these experiences and interactions, are characterised by eight attributes: 
	- (1) physical and psychological safety, 
	- (2) appropriate structure, 
	- (3) supportive relationships, 
	- (4) opportunities to belong, 
	- (5) positive social norms, 
	- (6) support of efficacy and mattering, 
	- (7) opportunities for skill-building and (8) integration across multiple contexts (NRC and IOM, 2002).
