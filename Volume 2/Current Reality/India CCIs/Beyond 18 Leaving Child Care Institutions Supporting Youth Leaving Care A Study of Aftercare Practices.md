# SUMMARY OF THE PAPER

## RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 

Thematic framework: Sphere of Aftercare- a comprehensive ideology of rehabilitative support and services for CLs, transitioning out of care.

- It divides the scope of Aftercare support/services into eight distinct but interdependent domains that are essential for CLsas they transition out of care.
    - a)Housing,
    - b) Physical Health
    - c) Independent Living Skills,
    - d) Education and Vocational Skills
    - e) Social Support and Interpersonal Skills
    - f) Financial Independence and Career
    - g)Emotional Wellbeing Identity and Legal Awareness
- Case studies classified using **Mike Stein's Resilience Framework**.
  - It identifies 3 main outcome groups
    - 1)young people ;moving on - who demonstrate greater resilience;
    - 2)surviving – who have faced the most barriers to help
    - 3) greater disruptions; or 'strugglers' who have faced who have the highest mental health needs and have faced greater barriers to help.
- Mixed Method employed.
- Analysis - A composite score for each of the eight domains was computed to develop a domain index. The scores for each of the eight domains were added and averaged out to give the overall **Aftercare Quality Index (AQI)**

## KEY FINDINGS

- Though Aftercare has been provisioned for within the JJ Act, 2015 and the JJ Model Rules, 2016 as well as the ICPS, it has so far not been put to uniform practise, leaving children exiting CCIs, on attaining the age of 18 years, as vulnerable youth who are no-ones&#39; responsibility.
- CLs at unique disadvantage due to lack of any preparation for transition from Childrens&#39; Homes as well as the absence of a supportive ecosystem around them once they leave care

## KEY INDICES
- CCI Life Experience Index is a composite score that factors continuity of education, association with family, stability or instability through multiple placements, feelings of empowerment as well as involvement in the planning of their future life. CCI Life Experience Index is positively correlated to practically all domains of the &#39;Sphere of Aftercare&#39;

- The CCI Skill Index A composite CCI Skill Index Score for three groups of skills, namely Job Readiness and Vocational Skills, Independent Living Skills, and Interpersonal Skills

- Aftercare Quality Index : A composite score, comprising of the following eight indices, was computed to give the Aftercare Quality Index:Housing Index, Physical Health Index, Independent Living Skills Index, Financial Index, Social Support and Interpersonal Skills Index, Education and Vocational Skills Index, Emotional Wellbeing Index, Legal Index

## DOMAIN FINDINGS: BASELINE DATA

- ### Status of Aftercare
  - More than 27% of the CLs did not receive any form of Aftercare support.
  - 67% CLs were not aware of Aftercare services and other welfare schemes that can be accessed by them

- ### Life Experience in CCIs
  - Two out of every five children went through multiple placements in CCIs, which adversely affect their education and attachment patterns.
  - 44% CLs were never consulted in their rehabilitation planning, 30% did not have adult mentors, only half of all CLs had a satisfactory CCI Life Experience Index score, About 37% of CLs had an &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; CCI Skill Index score

- ### Housing support during aftercare
  - Less than half of all CLs across states received housing support under Aftercare.
  - There are no Aftercare homes for girls, except one each in Delhi and Maharashtra.
  - Non-Institutional Housing to prepare CLs for Integration in Society
  - NGO stakeholders shared that establishing group homes is a challenge due to stigma and insensitivity among citizens, making it difficult to obtain rental housing. Also, there are no guidelines for semi regulated accommodation and group-housing
  - Analysis show that the adequacy of housing amenities for CLs had a strong positive correlation with: Access to physical health amenities and financial literacy, security and crisis in adulthood (Financial Index)
  - In-depth interviews reveal anxiety in CLs who are dependent on friends, extended family or employers for housing and do not have enough money to transition to independent living

- ### Emotional wellbeing
  - Over 61% CLs faced recurring emotional distress.
  - There is a greater negative impact on the Emotional Wellbeing of female CLs than male CLs.
  - Emotional Wellbeing Index is positively correlated to Aftercare Quality Index and Academic Career Index.

- ### Physical Health
  - 23% CLs did not have any caregiving support available during illnesses.
  - 13% CLs did not have adequate funds for health care
  - A greater proportion of male CLs (12% more than female CLs) had an unsatisfactory Health Index score than females

- ### Educational and Vocational Skills
  - half or less of all CLs had not received training in one or more employability related skills in CCIs
  - 40% of all CLs could not complete their schooling **and 34% dropped out during** transitioning. 24 CLs across the five states had not studied beyond primary education.
  - CLs who are not able to pursue higher education lose the possibility of career growth in life. For those who opt for vocational skills, the range of skill options available are few, leaving little space for CLs to explore skills in accordance to their interest and aptitude
  - Difficult to find funders for academically average students as well as to fund expensive courses thus pushing CLs towards cheaper alternatives

- ### Independent Living Skills
  - The index was calculated by considering whether CLs had acquired Nutrition &amp; health, Cooking, First Aid, Disaster management, Household management (taking care of belongings, hygiene, financial management) Exercise &amp; recreation skills through training or hands-on experience.
  - Two out of every five CLs required skill training in cooking, household management and disaster management, while for every social skill, more than 40% CLs requested training
  - Gender and Aftercare services impact extent of Independent Living Skills received. About 14% more female CLs received all Independent Living Skills than male CLs (except disaster management) while in CCIs as well as post leaving CCIs
  - The CLs from NGO run CCIs were found to be better equipped with skills rather than Government run CCIs. 73% CLs from Government run CCIs had a dissatisfactory Independent Living Index of CLs as compared to 60% CLs from NGO run CCIs.
  - The Independent Living Skills Index is positively co-related to Academic and Career Index, CCI Life Experience Index, Social Support and Interpersonal Skill Index, Financial Index and Aftercare Quality Index 

- ### Social support and Interpersonal skills
  - Half of the CLs faced inability in maintaining relations with their families and parents.Two third of the male CLs reported inability in maintaining romantic relationships and another 23% felt it was not applicable to them.
  - CLs require Social Skill Training in conflict resolution, communication, anti-bullying, leadership, gender neutrality
  - Social Support and Interpersonal Skill Index was calculated by factoring in the various relationships that CLs were able to maintain and whether they had acquired certain interpersonal skills such as: conflict resolution, effective communication, leadership, trust, team-building, legal rights, responsibilities and moral duties, ego-resiliency, self-esteem, gender neutrality, and inclusion

- ### Financial Independence and Career
  - 48% of CLs did not have an independent source of earning. 38% CL were not able to cover their living expenses with their present income. More females (63%) than males (36%) did not have an independent source of income despite a considerable percentage of girls completing class 12th.
  - The average monthly salary was between Rs. 7,500 and Rs. 8,500. One in every five CLs did not have a bank account.
  - About 37% of CLs had an unsatisfactory; CCI Skill Index score, indicating that CLs gained very minimal skill training during their stay in CCIs.
  - Financial Skill Index was computed factoring in aspects of CLs&#39; financial status –financial literacy, security and crisis. Financial Index is positively correlated to Social Support and Interpersonal Index, Academic and Career Index, Physical Health Index, Housing Index, Legal rights Index as well as Aftercare Quality Index, indicating that financial independence, financial security and access to financial services provide the CLs with the space and resources to invest in the other domains of the &#39;Sphere of Aftercare.

- ### Identity and Legal Awareness
  - 55% of all CLs did not receive any information regarding their legal rights and responsibilities during their stay in the CCIs. 70% female CLs did not have a PAN card 96% CLs had an Aadhar card.
  - The Legal Rights Index was low irrespective of gender, type of CCI where the CL lived and the status of Aftercare services received.

### JJ ACT Model Rules for aftercare

  - Rule 25 - State Governments to prepare an Aftercare programme for provisioning of education, employable skills, placement and housing for children, who have to leave CCIs on attaining eighteen years of age.
-
### State Machinery Roles

  - The State Child Protection Society (SCPS) is responsible to develop programmes for Aftercare and maintain database of ACOs.
  - The District Child Protection Unit (DCPU) develops Aftercare-related database at the district level to share with SCPS.
  - The Probation Officer, the Child Welfare Office Case Worker or Social Worker is supposed to prepare a post-release plan and submit the same to the Board or the Committee, two months before the release of the child.
  - CWC has to give directions to prepare Individual Care Plan (Rule 19 (4) JJ Act)
    - ICP has pre-release (rehabilitation and restoration) and post release components (restoration to families)
    - The ICP refers to the &quot;plan&quot; but does not define the process followed to achieve the plans

## Recommendations

- Recognize care leavers as a distinct vulnerable category in National Policy for Youth and National Policy on Skill Development and Entrepreneurship
- Provide the appropriate reservation to CLs in educational institutions for higher education and in jobs
- Amend the JJ Act to expand the definition of Aftercare so that children who turn 18 and leave care, are also entitled to Aftercare support, based on their individual needs
- The provision of Aftercare should be based on a mandatory assessment of Aftercare needs of all CLs
- The JJ Rules should provision for at least one Single Window Support Centre for CLs in every district of every state, to function under the existing DCPU. Provision for at least one State Aftercare Officer in SCPS and a District Aftercare Officer in every district of every state to head the Single Window Support Centre, as part of the DCPU
- ICPs should be strengthened as a tool for planning for the overall development of the child. IAPs should also be developed as a pathway planning post 18 years for independent life, and should be evolved with the close and active participation of the CLs.
- Every state should formulate their aftercare plan guidelines with strong M &amp; E and mechanisms for grievance redressal. Maintain a consent based MIS of CLs. Increase budget for aftercare.
- The process of preparation for transition should equip CLs with information on individual rights and entitlements, basic life skills, community exposure.
- The current allocation of Rs. 2,000 per month per child under CPS is inadequate and needs to be increased to a budget of up to Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 10,000 per youth per month.

## Miscellaneous Imp Info

- The average age of entering the CCIs range between 8 years to 12 years across states.
- The Rajasthan Legal Aid Services Authorities has issued a notification that orphans living in CCIs will be considered as Other Backward Class and can claim related reservation.
- The State of Maharashtra has provided Horizontal/Parallel Reservation to Orphan Children

in educational institutions and Government jobs for orphan candidates.
- Mode of Access to Aftercare Services: The preferred mode of access to Aftercare support/ services for 44% CLs was in person at a physical facility that is accessible
- The coordination and convergence within the child protection system with other systems like that of health, education, and urban affairs, is low.
- The team could not locate CLs who had transitioned out of care and were not receiving Aftercare, as there is no systematic record of these CLs within the child protection system. Therefore data on Aftercare received is, , not a robust indicator of availability and accessibility of Aftercare services in the five states.
