Context: To determine the childcare practices, morbidity status and nutrition status of preschool children 24-59 months of age living in orphanages in Kwale County,Kenya. A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted on a comprehensive sample of 162 children and 45 caregivers, drawn from a sample of 14 out of the 21orphanages in Kwale County, Kenya. (Page 14)

# Why is this important?
- According to this framework, **dietary intake and health status** are immediate determinants of child's nutrition status. (Page 21)
- Adequate dietary intake and good health status translate to good nutrition status of the child. (Page 21)
	- The consumption of a varied diet and frequency of feeding are important indicators for the attainment of adequate dietary intake. (Page 26)
- Nutrition of preschool children is of paramount importance as it forms the platform for growth and development (Chea et al., 2017). Nutrition has a direct impact in child’s life. Inadequate nutrition among preschool children attributed to poor childcare practices may result in retarded growth (Page 32)


# Current realities in orphanages

- Prevailing conditions in orphanages may predispose children to increased prevalence of malnutrition and infectious diseases like diarrhoea and respiratory tract infections. Unavailability of safe and nutritious foods in orphanage set up and access to safewater are likely to lead to increase levels of malnutrition among children. (Page 22) 
- However, studies have established that most caregivers lack nutrition awareness and that once a child reaches preschool age, caregivers divert their attention from the children to other matters and care giving becomes a secondary issue. Thus, the nutrition needs are neglected (Mile,Milena and Biljana, 2013). (Page 26)
- Child malnutrition is associated with susceptibility to infection and as a result many children are more likely to be prone to common childhood ailments such as diarrhoea and respiratory infections; and for those who survive, frequent illness affects their nutrition status due to lowered resistance to infections (Page 27)
- Various studies have shown that illness among children in orphanages is higher (30%) especially diarrheal disease compared with 7 % in non-orphanage children. It has also been shown that more boys are usually stunted with high morbidity rates than girls (Page 28)
- In a study carried out in Botswana (Misra & Bignami, 2008) it was found that children in orphanages were 49% more likely to be underweight than non-orphanage children. The findings concurred with those of Lindblade et al. (2003) in Malawi where it was demonstrated that the prevalence of malnutrition in children in orphanages (below 6 years old) was 55% compared with 30% of non-orphanage children. (Page 29)

# Study insights
- In the present study, majority (79.0%) of the preschool children consumed adequate amounts of recommended energy per day. (Page 56)
- For protein intake, nearly all (90.1%) children consumed adequate amounts of recommended proteins per day (Page 57)
- Prevalence of undernutrition seemed to increase significantly with an increase in length of stay in the orphanage (Page 69)
- Children whose caregivers had not received any form of training on childcare practices were more likely to be underweight, wasted and stunted respectively. (Page 72)
- Consumption of meat, fruits and vegetables was low. Low consumption of fruits and vegetables could expose children to the risk of micronutrient deficiencies that take long to manifest. All children were served same quantities of food. The difference in energy intake was a result of poor appetite, illness among children as well as age. (Page 93)
- The most prevalent illnesses were acute respiratory infections (ARIs),malaria and diarrhoeal diseases. (Page 93)
- Nutrition status (underweight) showed a positive significant relationship with institutional characteristics and dietary practices. (Page 94)
- The results imply that the longer a child stays in the orphanage, the more likely the child would be stunted and underweight. Children who consumed adequate energy intake were less likely to be underweight and stunted respectively (Page 94)
- From the study, it can be concluded that good nutrition status can be equated with appropriate childcare practices and low morbidity burden. Majority of children living in orphanages in Kwale County had good nutrition status as depicted by the low levels of undernutrition. This was likely due to consumption of at least three meals per day, diversity of foods consumed, appropriate knowledge in caregiving among thecaregivers in the orphanages, favourable caregiver to child ratios, good health care practices, adequate consumption of energy and other nutrients. This was also enhanced by the effect of the low morbidity burden noted among the children. (Page 95)
- The prevalence of the three forms of under-nutrition in this study was lower than the national figures. In addition, the levels of undernutrition are also lower than the WHO acceptable levels with an exception of wasting which is higher than the WHO acceptable levels of under-nutrition (Page 95)


# Recommendations 
[[Physical Health]]
- Hand washing is effective in minimizing incidence of diseases such as cholera and diarrhoea among children. It also reduces deaths from diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections by almost half and one quarter respectively (Page 28)
- The same study showed that among children in orphanages, 64% were stunted compared with 46% of the non- (Page 29)
- 16 orphanage children. In addition, girls in orphanages were more likely to be malnourished than boys. (Page 30)
- Research has demonstrated that positive interaction between a child and a caregiver significantly impacts the development of the brain (Page 31)
- Involvement of the community by supporting the running of the orphanages through both participatory and material support was viewed as long term solution to these problems. Participatory support would help in maintaining good discipline, moral values and life skills of the children and material support would ensure that their basic needs (health status and nutrition well-being) are met. (Page 55)
- The number of children served by each caregiver is critical to higher quality care.Poor caregiver to child ratio not only inhibits social interaction, but also influences the way caregiver responds to the needs of the children. Although young children in group care often fail to thrive, tend to be sickly and often demanding of attention; provision of supportive and stable caregiver to child relationships is of paramount importance (Page 75)
- Skipping breakfast during childhood has been associated with malnutrition and may also have an adverse effect on cognitive function, academic performance, psychosocial function and mood in children and young people (Page 81)
- Deworming has health benefits in children as worms impact negatively on the mental and physical development of children. Ample evidence have shown that deworming has a significant impact on health, education and livelihoods of treated children (Page 87)
- Outcomes of deworming include decreased anaemia and improves nutrition, increases growth and weight gain, improves cognition and mental and physical development, increases resistance to other infections, supports more frequent school attendance, improves children’s ability to learn better and be more active in (Page 87)
- The orphanage’s management in conjunction with the Ministry of Health should carry out monthly growth monitoring to detect early onset of malnutrition among children 6-59 months of age for timely intervention to reduce on cases of malnutrition. (Page 96)
- The orphanages’ management should intensify the supervision of children during meal times to ensure adequate dietary intake and inclusive consumption of food. A watchful eye and gentle warning can save children from malnutrition caused by poor dietary intake. (Page 96)

# Assessment tools
[[Assessment Tools]]
- A structured researcher-administered questionnaire for caregivers was the main data-collection tool. It was used to collect socio-demographic data, dietary intake, healthcare practices and anthropometric data. An observation checklist and Key InformantInterview (KII) guide were used to gather information on experiences and challenges on dietary practices, health care, water, hygiene, sanitation and other concerns relevant to the study about children in orphanages. (Page 39)
- Data on dietary practices was collected using a 7 day food frequency questionnaire and a 24-hour food recall. Anthropometric data was collected using SECA scale and paediatric height board. (Page 39)
- Water and Hygiene practices were assessed by collecting information on whether there was availability and accessibility of water for drinking and washing hands, frequency of brushing teeth and bathing, availability of latrines/ toilets or bathrooms and human waste disposal. Caregivers who reported bathing the children daily were rated as having good bathing hygiene while those who bathed children four to six times a week and less than four times a week were rated as having adequate and poor bathing hygiene respectively (UNICEF, 2009c). (Page 42)
- Furthermore, when less than 40 children share one latrine is usually considered fair, forty to one hundred children using one latrine is classified bad and 100 children sharing a single latrine is dangerous (Page 28)
- Respondents were to try to remember everything they fed the child and were provided with household measures used in the institution while feeding children. These household measures included; cups, plates, jugs, metallic containers and spoons.Caregivers were asked to measure total amounts of food served and total amounts eaten. These amounts were measured and converted into weights measurements. All the ingredients in the meals and their weights were recorded. Food models and pictures were used to help respondent judge and report portion size. (Page 44)

## Caregiving:
- However caregivers were on rotating shifts in most institutions and discouraged individualized care. “We discourage individualized care so that children don’t develop a preferred attachment to a specific caregiver” (Page 75)
- For reintegration purposes, every child in an orphanage should have an individualized case plan that minimizes the time spent in an orphanage and facilitates eventual integration into a family ( (Page 77)
