The Bucharest Early Intervention Project Core Group This study examined attachment in institutionalized and community children 12 – 31 months of age in Bu- charest, Romania. Attachment was assessed using ratings of attachment behaviors and ratings of caregiver descriptions in a structured interview. As predicted, children raised in institutions exhibited serious distur- bances of attachment as assessed by all methods. Observed quality of caregiving was related to formation and organization of attachment in children living in institutions. 

Children raised in institutions are at dramatically in- creased risk for a variety of social and behavioral problems, including disturbances of attachment (Zea- nah, 2000). In fact, disturbances of attachment have been central to the literature on the effects of institu- tionalization for more than 50 years. Descriptive studies of institutionalized children by Spitz (1945), Goldfarb (1945), Provence and Lipton (1962), and Wolkind (1974) among others, documented the aber- rant behaviors that later came to comprise the clinical syndrome of Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD) 

Perhaps the most important early study in this regard was Tizard’s study of young children placed in residential nurseries in London in the 1960s (Ti- zard & Hodges, 1978; Tizard & Rees, 1975). She identified a group of 65 children placed in these nurseries at birth or soon thereafter. Between the ages of 2 and 4 years, 24 of the children were adopted, 15 of the children were returned to their birth families, and another 26 remained institutionalized. When the 26 still institutionalized children were assessed at age 4 years, eight (30.8%) were emotionally withdrawn and unresponsive, displaying unusual social behaviors and no evidence of discriminated attach- ments. Another 10 (38.4%) children were indis- criminate, approaching and seeking attention from relative strangers as readily as from familiar care- givers. The remaining eight (30.8%) children had managed to develop a preferred attachment to a caregiver at the nursery (

In addition to this study of currently institution- alized children, two longitudinal studies of children adopted out of Romanian institutions have reported consistently high levels of indiscriminate or disin- hibited attachment behavior. Chisholm, Carter, Ames, and Morison (1995) and Chisholm (1998) found in- discriminate behavior to be one of the most persistent social abnormalities in her study of children adopted out of institutions. She identified indiscriminate ‘‘friendliness’’ in a number of children at a median of both 11 and 39 months post adoption.

In addition to ratios of caregivers to children, the question of the quality of caregiving that children re- ceive in institutions is important. Although previous studies of children adopted out of institutions (Chis- holm, 1998; O’Connor et al., 2003) and of children living in institutions (Smyke et al., 2002; Tizard & Rees, 1975) have demonstrated significan t individual differences in the children’s attachment behaviors, only one previous study has attempted to demonstrate an association with individual differences in caregiver behavior. In particular, it seems important to know if, within the context of a relatively depriving social environment, individual differences in caregiving behavior are relat- ed to children’s attachment.

ttachment . Attachment quality was assessed us- ing the Strange Situation Procedure (Ainsworth et al., 1978). Community children were assessed with their mothers. Institutionalized children were as- sessed with their ‘‘favorite’’ caregivers, as deter- mined by consensus of the staff. If no favorite caregiver could be identified, the child was seen with a caregiver who worked regularly with the child and knew the child well. Procedures for all participants were conducted in standard laboratory settings. Markers distinguishing group status were eliminat- ed (e.g., all caregivers dressed in street clothes). Videotaped assessments were coded by expert raters (Elizabeth Carlson and Alan Sroufe) unaware of children’s group status.

As predicted by attachment theory, serious disturbances of attachment are the rule rather than the exception in children raised in the relatively socially deprived context of contemporary institutions for young chil- dren in Romania.

One of the most important findings of the study was that even when the children had discernible attachment patterns, the patterns appeared to be anomalous or incompletely developed. 

Although it may be premature to derive firm conclusions from an initial study, nevertheless, these results suggest that the majority of institutionalized children in this study were not able to form selective attachments to their caregivers. Tentatively, we sug- gest that Levels 4 and 5 are compatible with selected attachments, but Levels 3 and below are not. The clear implication of these findings is that, in high-risk samples (e.g., maltreated children), in addition to classifications of attachment, the degree of attach- ment formation also needs to be assessed. Failure to examine this additional perspective may obscure important differences.

Another important contribution of this study was the demonstration that the quality of the caregiving that the child received in the institutional setting was significantly related both to the continuous rating of attachment and to the child’s organization of at- tachment. Impressively, these results held even when other variables, such as cognitive level, perceived competence, and quantitative interaction ratings, were controlled for. In contrast, there was no rela- tionship between caregiving quality and attachment in the community setting. Previous studies suggest a consistent if modest effect of sensitive caregiving and secure attachment (DeWolff & van IJzendoorn, 1997; NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 1997). The difference between institutionalized and com- munity children observed here suggest that indi- vidual differences in caregiving may matter more in an environment of severe deprivation. Variability in caregiving quality within the community sample may have been too limited to capture differences that related to attachment (particularly given that the sample is so skewed toward secure).
