## Scope:

## Negative impact of institutionalisation on development
-  Residency in an institution is associated with substantial developmental delays and other risks to children
- Longer stays in institutions are associated with larger developmental delays and atypical development in a dose–response manner 
- Delays are most prominent in physical growth, brain growth, cognition, and attention; atypical attachments are also seen
- Children show rapid recovery in the years immediately after deinstitutionalisation, particularly in physical and brain growth, although substantial impairment can persist for the most seriously affected children over the longer term 

## Key dimensions of childcare delivery in institutions

- Key quality  dimensions  include  
	- the extent of the training  staff  receive, 
	- the rate of staff turnover, 
	- the child - to -caregiver  ratio, 
	- the quality of food, and 
	- the standard of hygiene and health care, 
	- as well as factors that are essential for the  provision of engaged and responsive carer behaviour.  

## BEIP

- The  Bucharest  Early  Intervention Project (BEIP) 6  is the only study to use a  randomised controlled design to study the benefits of  deinstitutionalisation. Following an extensive baseline  assessment, 68 of the 136 children in institutions (aged  6–31 months) were randomly assigned to a high quality  foster care programme that was developed and financed by  the  investigators. 
-  The  other  68  children  were  randomly assigned to care as usual, which initially meant that  these  children  remained  in  institutional  care  (appendix  pp  1–2).  
- The  BEIP  therefore  provides  a  uniquely powerful test of the recuperative power of  family life compared with continuing institutional care.  
- The BEIP includes a pre- intervention assessment and a  comparison group of typically developing, age- matched  children  from  the  same  country.  
- The  project  also  introduced a degree of randomness with regard to age of placement into foster care (ie, duration of institutional  care), meaning that the BEIP provides the strongest test of the causal relationship between institutional exposure and adverse outcomes that we are aware of




Preinstitutional context Given the reasons that children are placed in institutions, these children are highly likely to have been exposed to  a range of risks before being institutionalised. This  preinstitutional exposure to risks represents a substantial confounder in estimates of the effects of subsequent  exposures. 

Contextual variations within institutions Of great clinical importance is whether associations  between institutionalisation and outcomes vary as a  function of the duration and timing of exposures and the quality of care. The potential for recovery might be  constrained for exposures exceeding a specific duration  or severity, or that occur during specific sensitive periods of development. 

Section 4: accounting for individual variations in the sequelae of institutional care 

uration and timing of institutional care Many studies have reported a relationship between the  duration of institutionalisation and both the severity of  adverse outcomes and the scale of recovery observed after deinstitutionalisation. Our meta ­ analyses addressed the  issue of the severity of adverse outcomes by examining  the 89 studies that chart the longitudinal relationship  between duration of children’s stay in institutions and  developmental outcomes. We found a dose–response  association, with longer stays in the institution predicting larger developmental delays and deviations.

Postinstitutional influences Parent and family resources The degree and rate of recovery after deinstitutional­ isation and the ultimate level of functioning that children have might be affected by characteristics of the receiving families. Families who adopt children from institutions  through international adoption tend to have high socio­ economic status. 112 As in many aspects of child develop­ ment, the education of the parents and the family income and access to resources might have an important role,  with maternal education, family income, and the stability of the family structure predicting educational outcomes. 

The link between care quality and outcomes is shown  by  a  quasi ­ experiment  by  the  St  Petersburg–USA  Orphanage Research Team. 4 The intervention used in this experiment (without randomisation and thus with the  risk of pre ­ existing differences influencing the outcomes) was to improve the quality of institutions to stabilise their structure (eg, by employing fewer and more consistent  caregivers, integrating groups of fewer children, and  having no periodic graduations of children to new groups) and to make the interactions between caregivers and  children more engaged and responsive.

Quality of postinstitutional care The type of postinstitutional placement might also affect children’s socioemotional and cognitive develop ment.  For  example,  in  the  BEIP,  investigators  compared  one group of children living in BEIP ­ sponsored foster  families who had benefited from specialised training and support with another group of children placed with  government ­ sponsored foster parents who came forward as part of child protection reform efforts. 

ndividual differences in parenting Children  adopted  internationally  often  become  an  ethnic  or  racial  minority  in  another  culture  with  two parents from the majority racial and ethnic group.  The key issue is how families can provide transracially  adopted children with the skills to buffer themselves  against discrimination. 

Child characteristics The  developmental  status  of  a  child  at  the  time  of  their  placement  in  a  family  after  institutional  care  might influence the recovery trajectory of that child.  One pre diction might be that the more ingrained the  effects of deprivation are, the less amenable to recovery  and the more persistent the problems might be. Few  studies have tried to quantify the extent to which individual variations in characteristics at the time of placement in a family determine medium ­ term to long ­ term outcomes. A relationship  has  been  found  between  physiological  dysregulation linked to the effects of institutional care and functioning after removal from the institution.  

Child-related factors Genetic factors Several studies of candidate genes for specific disorders have shown that genetic variations might affect the  susceptibility  of  a  child  to  both  negative  effects  of  institutional care and positive responses to placement in a supportive family.
