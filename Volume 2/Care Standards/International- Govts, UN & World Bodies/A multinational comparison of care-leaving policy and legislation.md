# **Brief:**

- Scope &amp; Description:  This paper maps multinational policy and legislation and its impact on the services to careleavers and the challenges they experience in 36 countries spread across both Americas, Europe and Asia, Africa and Australia. It provides a review of literature on multinational comparative research on care-leaving findings in relation to three foci: multinational policy and legislation, services for care-leavers and the challenges faced by them. Findings reveal that few countries have well-developed care-leaving legislation. Most countries provide little aftercare beyond the age of 18, even when legislation provides for it.

# **Summary**

## Issues with Global literature on Careleavers

- International comparisons are rarely represented in studies
- Existing literature on careleavers in different countries is usually approached as collections or compilations of care-leaving research in different countries, rather than presenting work that truly compares care-leaving across several countries
- Publications that deal with generic issues in relation to care-leaving tend to be theoretically oriented and not focussed on care-leaving in the context of different countries
- Multinational comparative research is hampered by a lack of consensus regarding the topic being studied.
- For comparative work to be undertaken, a conceptual model or framework had to be developed to provide a basis for specific questions
- There are also differences between countries in welfare systems, in the construction of childhood and adulthood and the transition between them, make international comparisons of care-leaving difficult
- When reviewing international comparisons, the focus is usually limited to the Global North
- A larger work on international comparisons does exist in relation to young people who are still in care. This is due to the greater availability of official data on young people in care than for young people aging out of care or for those who have left

## Methods Used

- an online, mixed-methods survey to query international care-leaving policy and practices
- Survey included 35 items spanning five major topicareas:
  - general information about each country;
  - provisions and logistics for the administration of general child welfare policy;
  - care-leaving legislation and policy;
  - programmes and entitlements for care-leaversand current challenges characteristic of care-leavers in each country
- Questionnaire generated a range of quantitative and qualitative results
- Participants were recruited through two international associations: the International Federation of Educative Communities (FICE) and the Africa Network of Care-Leaving Researchers (ANCR).

## Findings

### Care-leaving policy and legislation

- Of the 36 countries in the study, 32 (89 per cent) reported that they have legislation that addressed children in care,
- Of the 32 countries, 23 judged their country legislation to be well-developed rather than rudimentary
- Only 17 country participants (47 per cent of the total sample) reported having legislation addressing care-leavers after leaving care and/or aftercare services,
- All the countries reporting no legislation on children in care also had no legislation on care-leavers.
- Thus, while two thirds of countries have well developed legislation for children who are placed into alternative care, only one fifth have well-developed legislation for these children after they leave care.

### Careleaving Services

- The decreasing rate of legislative protection as young people transition from care to young adulthood impacts the age up until which young people can rely on support through child and youth welfare systems
- There are considerable differences between the official ages at which care ends and the actual ages at which young people leave – young people tend to leave care at an earlier age than legislation actually permits
- In short, nine countries that legally permit young people to remain in care beyond 18 do not actually allow them to remain in care beyond 18years
- There is little congruence between legislative or policy limits for remaining in care and the actual age up until which care-leavers remain in care.
- Where services do exist, a major emphasis is the provision of support to increase access to the labour market because education/ employment services are offered by 18 of 24 countries with aftercare services.
- Care-leaver centres that provide a point of contact are less frequent, available in 10 countries (42 per cent), at the same rate as the provision of counselling opportunities related to problem-specific challenges, such as managing debt or housing problems.
- &quot;coming back&quot; option – the possibility of moving back into care after leaving care even at an older age – is available in only five countries (21 per cent).
- Countries with well-developed legislative frameworks tend to offer a broader range of services than countries with less well-developed legislation.
- 36 countries (53 per cent) reported having active care-leaver associations.

### Challenges faced by Careleavers

- The findings suggest that employment is the main challenge for care-leavers, being reported by all but two of the countries surveyed
- Not far behind, education, housing and poverty were perceived as main challenges in 31 countries. Isolation or loneliness was observed as a challenge in 29 countries and mental health in 27 countries. Delinquency and substance abuse were reported in 22 countries.

### Limitations of the study

- Absence of the perspectives of care-leavers as a counterpoint to the views of our key informants
- These data represent responses from experts and are not based on an insider view of the everyday life of care-leavers in different countries
- .There may have been discrepancies in the terminology used to describe child welfare practice, such that the questions may not
- In providing the survey in only one language, there may be a language bias that impacted the results

### Implications of the findings

- Despite the many difficulties care-leavers face, they have access to relatively few services and even fewer legal entitlements, which in some cases are not even actualized in practice.
- They are left to survive on their own at age 18 or younger, even when legislation makes provisions for them to stay in care longer
- In fact, the availability of appropriate services has a dramatic impact on whether young people thrive or falter, such that &quot;the social ecology that surrounds vulnerable youth is as important as the particular characteristics of the young person in terms of creating potential for change
- A significant and renewed debate – or rather, a social movement – is required that champions the universal rights of care-leavers after they have turned 18 and that strongly supports them in the transition to adulthood
- Formation of an international association of care-leavers that campaigns at a global level for reforms to promote optimal outcomes for youth from care everywhere can help promote the rights of careleavers
