## INTRODUCTION

- Once a child completes 18 years of age, they cease to be a minor and become an adult — whether living with their family or in the protective custody of the State. 
- This age is significant for two reasons. 
	- One, it marks the end of the State’s responsibility, authority, and rights to care for the child, as per the principle of parens patriae
	- Two, the adult, now, possesses a different set of rights and is expected to assume more responsibility and learn to make their decisions more independently. 

However, for those who have been in a Child Care Institution (CCI), or an authoritative and non - participatory set - up, this transition may not always be easy. For instance, young girls who have been victims of trafficking may grow up with a sense of a lack of agency because their life decisions are usually controlled by other adults, often contradicting their own needs. Moreover, even after completing 18 years of age, many are in the phase of completing formal education or vocational training and may need upskilling to become financiall y self - reliant. Finally, older children, who are rescued from commercial sexual exploitation (CSE) around the ages of 16 and 17 years only benefit from institutionalized care and protection for a while. There is also very little time to adequately assess t heir needs and evolve an appropriate rehabilitation and social reintegration plan for them. In some cases, children experience chronic trauma and require therapy, which can take anywhere between 6 months to a year. Thus, even after completing 18 years of a ge and leaving a CCI, these care leavers may still need care, protection, and handholding.

- Aftercare refers to providing support, financially, or otherwise, to persons, who have completed 18 years of age but not completed 21 years, and have left any institutional care to join mainstream society. 
- As per the Juvenile Justice Act 2015 (JJA 2015), a child can receive institutional care and protection only till the time they ar e a ‘child’ as per the law — that is, until they complete 18 years of age. 2 The JJA also describes ‘aftercare,’ 3 as the extension or continuum of care for a child in need of care & protection (CNCP) or a child in conflict with law (CCL) after they complete 18 years of age. 
- However, the legal provision of aftercare services to individua ls exiting the JJ System is still unclear. There are certain gaps and potentially conflicting interpretations emanating from the Act and the Rules. The JJA 2015 and the Maharashtra Rules 2018 are silent on whether a child who leaves institutional care befo re completing 18 years is entitled to aftercare or not. Strictly speaking, the provision under section 46 of the JJA 2015 6 can also be read to imply that children leaving a CCI before completing 18 years are not to be provided with aftercare. 
- On completion of 18 years of age, an individual leaving care is restored to their parents/guardians, as far as possible. Admission to Aftercare residential facilities is provided only to those youth who are orphans, or do not want to return t o the biological family, or for whom it is not safe to return to the biological family. 
- However, the non - residential aftercare services for personal, social and vocational guidance should be made available to all the youth exiting the CCIs until they are 2 1 years of age, based on their Individual Care Plan (ICP). 
- Youth exiting institutions for children with mental or physical disabilities, run under the Department of Social Justice/Welfare, should also be eligible for the “After Care Programme” run under th e Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS) after due verification and certification by the CWC. 

## OBJECTIVES OF AFTERCARE
- Enable such children's smooth transition from childhood to adulthood by participation in the community life; 
- Develop qualifications and skills for apprenticeship/jobs/livelihood/entrepreneurship for socio - economic self - reliance;
- Develop life skills for self - esteem, emotional intelligence, communication skills and relationship skills; and
- Develop day - to - day living skills, and citizenship rights and responsibilities for the youth such as financial literacy, identity documents, etc.
- Ensure that the youth leaving care is freed of any stigma attached to their association with the juvenile justice system. 


## LEGAL FRAMEWORK
- Maharashtra State Rules 2018 According to the Maharashtra Rules, the State Government shall provide education, employable skills, placements, as well as a place to stay as part of the “After Care Programme” for children who leave the CCI on attaining 18 years of age. Rule 27(7) lists the services provided under the “aftercare programme”: (1) aftercare home (AH); (2) community group housing or group home (GH) on a temporary basis for groups of six to eight persons. Both these services are shelter based — the most urgent and common need of young adults leaving the JJ system. 
- Other aftercare support services — as per 27(8) of the JJ Rules of Maharashtra — for children discharged from CCIs on attaining 18 years of age, include: 
	- I. provision of stipend during the course of vocational training or scholarships for higher education and support till the person gets employment; 
	- II. arrangements for skill training and placement in commercial establishments through coordination with National Skill Development Programme, Indian 6 Institute for Skill Training and other such Central or State Government programmes and corporate, etc.; 
	- III. provi sion of a counsellor to stay in regular contact with such persons to discuss their rehabilitation plans; 
	- IV. provision of creative outlets for channelizing their energy and to tide over the crisis periods in their lives; 
	- V. arrangement of loans and subsidies fo r persons in after - care, aspiring to set up entrepreneurial activities; and 
	- VI. encouragement to sustain themselves without State or institutional support 

Prerana has worked tirelessly to rehabilitate minor girls rescued from the sex trade since 2000. After the initial healing and self - integration, it was seen that the victims of organized crime, including human trafficking and physical and sexual assaults s uffer from a variety of mental illnesses such as anxiety, depression, Post - Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), aggression, self - destructive tendencies, etc. 


1.6. Needs Identified in the Aftercare Model The chapters that follow discuss the needs identified for care leavers. Primarily, these focus on:
- Shelter
- Health 
- Social Protection/Welfare Schemes
- Development
- Life Skills 
- Social Integration 

# SHELTER 

- The Policy and Guidelines for the ‘Integrated Programme of Non - Institutional Family - based Services for Child Protection’ (2019) recommends that aftercare services should be provided in a location where the care leaver has spent a significant number of years unless they wish to move to a different location. This helps care leavers stay in touch with a contact at the CCI who could support their transition to society. However, Prerana’s experience shows that this may not always be possible as sometimes, educational institutions, rental flats, or livelihood training and job sites may not be close to the CCI where the child used to reside. Under shelter, two specific needs have bee n identified: safety, and social protection and security. 

## Safety 2.1.1. 
### Legal Status 

There is a lack of explicit and implicit legal provisions on the requirements of validating the legal status of a supervised aftercare facility, like an Aftercare Home (AH). There is no clarity on the registration of aftercare residential facilities run by voluntary organizations or the government under the JJ Act 2015. 

### Prerana Practices 
- Currently, Prerana does not run a GH on its own per se but is engaged in the Externally - Assisted Group Homes (GH - EA) for girl victims of Commercial Sexual Exploitation and other care leavers above the age of 18. Once four to six girls agree to live together, Prerana assists them with the identification of a residential unit and the registration of the leas e agreement. Sometimes, there are GHs that are being run by older girls with whom Prerana has worked in the past. Girls exiting CCIs might be placed in such GHs with external financial and other assistance provided by Prerana. 

The girls, who have exited t he institutional life as care leavers might not be under the direct jurisdiction of the CWC. However, the CWC may have appointed an individual/ organization to follow up on the youth care leaver post their discharge from the CCI. 

Prerana also works on a few other critical things to assist the care leavers.
- Checks the legal validity of the unit: Prerana carries out a ‘title search’ to assess the legal validity of the dwelling unit/establishment as well as the competence of the individual who is the signing authority. 11 Section 2 (41) of the JJ Act 2015, “open shelter” means a facility for children, established and maintained by the State Government, either by itself, or through a voluntary or non - governmental organisati on under sub - section ( 1 ) of section 43, and registered as such, for the purposes specified in that section; 
- Facilitates the signing of lease agreements: Prerana acts as a link between the real estate agents and the residents. The organization also ensures that the lease agreement is signed in the name of one of the resident/s and not in t he name of the assisting organization. Often, this resident is a senior care leaver who has had some experience of living in a GH or aftercare facility and is in a position to mentor care leavers.
- Audits the residential area : Prerana conducts visits to the units to check the physical safety of the structures (like checking for exposed electrical wires, safety concerns from disasters and hazards), as well as the physical and social environment (such as the proximity to public transit systems). A representati ve from the organization meets the neighbors, maps the basic amenities and community resources available, and acts as a link between the landlord or the real estate agent (wherever involved) and the resident girls.
-  Assigns a duly vetted local guardian : Usually, a woman, who the organization is familiar with or who has volunteered with the organization is assigned to guide and support the residents. This mentor is usually residing close to the GH. The guardians are made aware of Prerana’s Safeguarding and P rotection Policy. 
- Orients the residents with the community: This includes discussions with the residents about setting ground rules for visits by the landlord, and the in - and out - times for the residents. 
- Aids financially to set up the GH - EA, if required: Pays the rent for up to one year, if required. For girls solely pursuing education, Prerana makes the contribution on their behalf for rent and essential services like groceries. 
- Conducts regular follow - ups with the residents: This includes visi ts from an organizational representative (at least twice a month) and regular follow - ups through phone calls. 
- the organization facilitating the GH - EA may also terminate its association after completing the stipulated time period and may be unable to continue providing the assistance. In such cases, termination is planned and structured and in consultation with the Care leaver and CWC (if relevant). In some cases, the residents may approach another organization to provide the continuation of external assistance. In some other cases, the organization may take the initiative to put the resident women in contact with another CSO which is willing to provide the support externally. If the organization facilitating the GH - EA recognizes that the residents are self - reliant and capabl e of running the facility independently, they may decide to exit the formal association with the GH. This, of course, needs to be done with prior consultation and over a period of time, to gradually wean off the assistance and support. 
- Protection and Security 2.2.1. Operational Guidelines The operational guidelines are slightly different in Aftercare Homes (AH) as compared to a GH or a GH - EA. AH can be run by the government, CSOs, or voluntary organizations. Often, they are run by those voluntary orga nizations that have a CCI and extend their services to the care leavers during their aftercare phase. In such cases, the rules of the AH may be similar to that of the CCI, with relatively more independence granted to the now - adult residents. AHs also have their own rules and manuals/SOP/checklists/best practices/guidelines set by the authorities with or without consultation with the residents, to be followed by the residents and staff. In a GH or GH - EA, the rules are set down by the resident girls and facilitated by the organization. 
- Prerana Practices Prerana follows a participatory process and works with the residents in evolving rules  that are in their best interest and address their needs. They are in the form of  ‘self - regulatory mechanisms’; the residents put together a ‘document of rules’ to wh ich all the residents give their commitment. These rules are often revisited whenever required. Prerana’s role is thus that of a facilitator, helping care leavers to lead, make informed decisions and take charge of their lives. 
- Protection Against Vulnerabilities Emanating from Immediate Social Environment An individual who has been a part of the JJ system needs to be in a physically safe space that protects them from abuse, exploitation, harassment or any other forms of violence. In case of an AH or a GH, it is essential that the residence is in an area away from the potential dangers of re - trafficking and re - victimization — and the neighborhood is conducive to their rehabilitation. 

### PRERNA PRACTICES
- Organizes orientations on personal safety: This includes sharing information and contact details of helplines and support organizations in the immediate neighborhood. Prerana also educates the residents about situations where the girls should approach the police station, as well as their rights wh ile at the police station. 
- Creates a system to screen and monitor visits from non - residents at the GH: Since a GH prepares residents to eventually manage a home, visits from guests are only rightful and obvious. For a fulfilling social life, it’s important that the girls learn to build social relations. However, this might not always be easy and carries several safety implications. Prerana educates the girls about such implications, assesses the situation when needed, and facilitates consultation with the r esidents to make rules on visits from outsiders.
- Connects residents with the community : Prerana connects the residents to public resources of the State and the civil society (e. g. local police station, local residential committees) for their safety and security. 
- Discusses issues of online safety: Makes the residents aware of the vulnerabilities and potential dangers for offenses committed online, and the precautions to be taken, in case the girls are faced with such a situation. 

### Prerana Practices In a GH -
- EA, Prerana helps residents understand safety in operational terms and discusses helpful tips t o stay safe since the external, authoritative supervision is limited. Prerana undertakes the following activities to help residents take responsibility for their personal safety
- Helps residents evolve ‘self - regulatory mechanisms’
- Creates a ‘Code of Conduct
- Provides regular individual and group counseling to deal with challenges in independent living
- Installs disaster - mitigation devices, mechanisms, and systems e.g. fire extinguishers. 

# Mobility and Self - Dependence 
A person above the age of 18 years is legally an adult and should not be constrained from moving about freely. Freedom of movement enables self - dependence and makes the 19 residents confident to navigate life on their own. 

## Grievance Redressal and Conflict Management 

Residents Develop a System to Resolve Conflicts Internally 

Collective living is bound to cause differences of opinion and conflict among the residents. These conflicts are to be dealt with constructively and fairly. However, it may not be possible for an organization to always mediate between the residents, making it necessary for them to be equipped with basic conflict - resolution skills, especially at a GH - EA. In the case of an AH, if a resident has concerns that require to be addressed by the organization, there are mechanisms already put in place. 

## Prerana Practices In the GH - EA by Prerana, 
- the residents work together to create certain rules. The organization facilitates sessions on conflict resolution, financial management and safety for the residents. If the conflict or concerns are external, the organization acts as a mediator. 
- Prerana also organizes alumni meetings where the alumni share their learnings of overcoming the challenges of living together. In Prerana’s experience, the informal network of care leavers acts as great support for the care leavers. 
- Prerana undertakes the following activities to facilitate conflict resolution amongst residents:
	- Sets up internal systems of conflict resolution: Prerana sets up systems for residents to meet regularly to discuss all kinds of concerns in group living. The residents can also report to the social worker in case of more serious grievances.
	- Sets up externally assisted systems of conflict resolution : Prerana brings in peers to help conflict resolution. This is done only after the residents agree and want an external set - up. The external peers are also decided and finalized after consultation with the residents.
	- Organizes group and individual counseling sessions: This helps the residents navigate difficult situations at the individual and the group level

## Physical Access 
- To learn how to live independently, residents must be able to access public transit systems from the place of residence to access basic civic amenities, educational and vocational opportunities. Prerana Practices Prerana facilitated an ‘access audit’. It can be a deciding factor in selecting a location for a GH - EA. In certain cases, Prerana provides a predetermined travel allowance or reimbursement . The organization also carries out a hands - on orientation on accessing the public transport systems. 
- Transitioning to an independent lifestyle: After living with others and under the supervision of an institution, transitioning to GH - EA and living in smaller groups can be hard for some. While in the CCI, the girls get used to being taken care of, especially when they are ill. In Prerana’s experie nce, sometimes, girls in the GH call the social worker when they fall sick, and only go to the health clinic when they are accompanied. They might also face difficulties in traveling alone or accessing public transport. In general, many residents still rely on their social worker for instructions. 

### Challenges Faced While Addressing This Need
- Some challenges that Prerana encounters while working to ensure safe and secure shelter are: Finding safe accommodations for girls: Finding a regularized property (which is free from the risk of getting demolished and is equipped with the basic civic amenities) in an already over - populous metropolitan city is difficult. 
- Sometimes, even if such a residence is a vailable, it’s difficult to extend the lease past the initial 11 months due to incremental costs that the residents might not be able to afford. Moreover, during periods of high demand and low supply of housing units, t he renewal of lease agreements can be difficult . 
- Apart from that, finding accommodation for a small group of single, young women is extremely challenging because of certain patriarchal norms in society. Women who stay alone are often stigmatized and frowned upon. 
- Some societies also set limitations to the timings for the girls to abide by, try to investigate the religious and social background of the girls out of curiosity, and hence, put them in an uncomfortable position 
- The newfound independence can also be hard to adjust to for some girls. They may like to stay out till late in the evening to be with their friends. Some have a hard time learning to prioritize savings and end up spending more on clothes, footwear, make - up, mobile phones, etc. as compared to food and hygiene supplies. 
- Navigating group dynamics: AHs may have authoritarian ways to resolve conflicts or handle grievances, but such authority is absent in GH - EA . In cases where the re sidents are self - reliant and driven, this process is facilitated well. 
- However, in cases where residents are not particularly engaged in the process of leading the functioning of the GH, the process of conflict resolution might become cumbersome. When peop le of different age groups stay together, there is a risk of younger residents being dominated or bullied by the older ones. Sometimes, residents also leave the facility prematurely after joining, without ensuring a safe and secure alternative accommodatio n and/or without working on a sound future plan for themselves. This leads to excess per capita cost for the remaining residents . 

### Social vulnerabilities: 
Once supervision is significantly reduced and girls get relatively greater freedom, there may be a risk of exposure to trafficking, re - trafficking, or exploitation. 

Prerana Practices Prerana prepares a contact list of important local medical professionals and hospitals close to the GH - EA. 

## Mental Health
- Access to Mental Health Services Unlike physical health, mental health is lesser - known to most. Information must be given to residents on what mental health means, how to access mental health services, and ways to tackle mental health stigma and discrimination. 
- Prerana Practices Prerana empanels mental health service p rofessionals, like psychiatrists, therapists and counselors for the residents to be accessed when needed. Stress management sessions are facilitated with the residents by a 35 counselor from Prerana. 
- Following activities are undertaken to facilitate access to mental health services:
	- Need - based visits by a counselor to the GH - EA. 
	- Need - based visits to a psychiatrist. 
	-  Group sessions to discuss the importance of self - care and ways to practice it.  
- Facilitates orientation visits to the hospital: When the young care leavers move into their GH - EA, the social worker plans an orientation visit to the local hospital. In case the 34 care leavers are suffering from certain ailments which need medical intervention, the social worker orients the care leaver on how to avail OPD (Outpatient Department) services in a hospital. 
- Pays for medical care, if required: Early on, when the care leavers have just moved out of their CCIs and into the GH - EA, they might not be equipped to take care of their medical expenses . In such situations, Prerana supports them financially. 
- Creating a panel of doctors that a resident can reach out to, in case of emergency : Through local guardians, Prerana tries to create a pool of doctors that the GH - EA residents can approach in case of any medical emergencies. 
- Encourage young women to invest in a health insurance policy : Initially, the residents might not be able to invest in an insurance policy. Sometimes, Prerana tries to arrange for health insurance for the first year through the sup port of donors. 
- However, the residents must understand the importance of managing their health expenses and are thus encouraged to invest in a health insurance policy themselves after the first year 

## Some Self - Care Tips

- Cook a meal for yourself. 
- Write one good thing about yourself as a daily reminder on y our phone. 
- Clean your spaces – cupboards, storage, etc. 
-  Watch a documentary. 
- When feeling particularly stressed, take a day off from work. 
- Read inspiring quotes. 

### Challenges Faced While Addressing the Need 
Some challenges that Prerana has experienced while enabling access to health needs include: 
- Timely access to civic amenities: There may be a mismatch between the schedules of the residents and the availability of civic amenities. 
- Difficulty in providing special diets: In a GH - EA, creating and providing special diets is often expensive and time - consuming. While residents can gradually learn to prepare their own food, it may be difficult to meet special dietary requirements all the time. 
- Access to health insurance: Health insurance is not accessible to most residents. Even if a resident has health insurance, it mostly covers hospitalization and not the OPD treatment. Hence, the residents end up incurring significant expenses. Most insurance packages also do not cover pre - existing condit ions or charge heavy premiums when they do 
- Spread of infections : Control ling the spread of communicable diseases, if all residents do not agree to have a collective approach to the treatments, could become a problem. Sometimes, stray animals (dogs, cats, cattle, monkeys) in the vicinity can also spread diseases . 
- While Aftercare Homes do have provisions like refrigeration to store leftover/surplus food, GH - EA often does not have these facilities thereby causing wastage of excess and perishable food and sometimes leading to infection if such items are consumed by the residents. 
- Supervision of individual health issues: Issues such as substance dependence, especially alcoholism, can be a challenge for the resident as well as the others that live with them 
- Mental health: Certain mental health concerns can cause serious adjustment issues in group living, challenging the very viability of group - living. Moreover, mental health services are costly and hence, often inaccessible for a resident in a GH - EA as they are living on their own. 
- Residents with a disability are often made to feel unaccepted or left out in a GH. Bullying and body shaming are issues that need to be addressed effectively. 


# SOCIAL PROTECTION AND WELFARE 
Documentation Procurement and verification of documents are essential to establish eligibility for a variety of welfare and development services in both the AH and GH. The documents needed to establish identity and eligibility of social protection/welfare schemes include : birth certificate, caste/community certificate, domicile certificate, school - leaving certificate, Aadhar Card, Voter ID Card, Ration Card, PAN Card, PwD Certificate (Person with Disability) and BPL/EWS Certificate (Below Poverty Line/Economically Weaker Sections) 

## Prerana Practices
- In the last five years, most girls referred to aftercare have had their essential documents such as the Aadhar card, PAN card, bank account, and school - leaving certificate through the CCI. 
- In cases where the resident girls do not possess certain important ident ity documents, the social workers assist the residents in applying for the same. Sometimes, they also provide a reference letter or document through Prerana to aid that process. The social workers also closely follow - up with the resident and the issuing au thorities or local bodies to procure the documents. 

## Challenges Faced When Addressing This Need 

- Errors in the records : Sometimes, when documents are available, there may be a commonly observed discrepancy in the names of the individuals i.e. different names on different documents or spelling errors in parents’ names.
- Social vulnerabilities: Desperation and sometimes, the urgency to seek necessary documents makes individuals vulnerable to frauds and deception. 
- Time - consuming: As there is no single - window ap proach for building one’s set of documents. It takes a lot of time, energy, financial resources and commitment, especially while working with government bodies to procure documents. 
- Updating new information: There is a general lack of clarity on which auth ority is responsible for issuing which document as well as the process for updating personal information on an already existing document. For eg, in case of an Aadhar card, it may be made by the CCI and often the address of the CCI listed in the card with a contact number of a CCI staff member. Once the child moves out, updating these credentials on the card becomes a challenge. 
- The risks and challenges of addressing social protection/welfare needs include:
	- Non - availability of the records: In cases where the original copies of the identity documents are not available, it is a challenge to establish identity or eligibility. The absence of basic supporting documents also makes it almost impossible to procure new documents. 

## Education 

Access to Formal Education Programs Conventionally, formal education is considered as attending regular school. However, certified vocational education, education for individuals with special needs, adult education and distance education are also recognized as formal education. As per UNESCO , formal education programs are those which are recognized by the relevant national educational authorities or equivalent 

Prerana Practices Prerana gives importance to education and encourages children to pursue formal education depending on their interest and capacity to continue the same.

p. 53

rerana undertakes the following activities to assist residents in accessing formal education: ● Develops a directory of resources: Puts together a resource directory of schools, colleges, and distance learning universities to help residents choose options based on their interests.  ● Liaisons with educational institutions : Follow - up with educational institutes on admissions, queries, or challenges that the residents may be facing. ● Provides financial assistance: Especially to travel (to schools, colleges, etc.) and procure study materials. Sometimes, Prerana may also procure study materials through partners and donors, and sponsor girls interested in completing their edu cation. Admission and tuition fees may also be taken care of through a scholarship. 

p. 54

● Facilitates mentorship: Actively mentor residents to keep them motivated and avoid drop - outs. This also includes career counseling to help residents make decisions about their future. 

5.1.2. Access to Functional Literacy Programs Access to functional literacy or basic writing, reading and calculation abilities is important for an individual to live efficiently and independently in society. UNESCO defines “functionally literate” as a "person who can engage in all those activities in which literacy is required for effective function of his/her group and community and also for enabling him/her to continue to use reading, writing and calculation for his/her own and community's development." For illiterate/semi - literate victims, function al literacy, coupled with vocational training, is important to manage their daily life. 

p. 55

Skill Development for Employability Self - reliant rehabilitation of residents is not possible without first ensuring their economic self - reliance. Since the residents are largely without any assets, their chances of economic self - reliance depend on sustainable employment. 

5.2.1. Access to Vocational Training Skill - based training helps in improving an individual’s employability. According to the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), Vocational Education and Training (VET), also called C areer and Technical Education (CTE), prepares learners for jobs that are based on manual or practical activities.  

Prerana Practices Prerana actively explores marketable skills for residents through consultations. It seeks to design and administer vocational training p rograms for young adults and care leavers that, eventually, help them land good jobs. 

The following activities are untaken by Prerana: ● Provides referrals to Community - Based Organizations (CBOs) for functional literacy services: CBOs often run literacy programs in various 45 communities for young adults and women managing households. Prerana collaborates with such CBOs and refers girls from the GH who have not pursued formal education or have had limited exposure to a liter acy program. ● Mapping local resources for the resident girls to access such programs: In the past, some of the girls have been interested in pursuing specific courses like verbal English. Prerana assists in locating cost - effective programs for such resident s. 

p. 56

● Maintains a directory of re sources : Prerana puts together a list of vocational training providers along with the nature of the training. ● Visits to vocational training facilities : Prerana accompanies girls to centers to make them aware of the registration process and assist them wit h admissions. 46 ● Provides need - based linkages: Connects the residents with service providers, sponsorship programs, etc. to help them pursue and complete their vocational training programs. ● Supports financially: Helps the residents with a travel allowance. Most of the residents are also supported with basic living costs when they first move out of the CCI into a GH and enroll for such training programs. ● Liaisons with corporates: Mobilizes corporates for vocation training programs for care leavers with minimal educational restrictions. Makes referrals and follow - ups with the service provider to assess the progress of the girls, and hopefully, translate training into job placements. 

p. 57

5.3. Job Placement and Preparedness Children who have lived in institutions for a long period — until becoming a ‘care leaver’ at 18 years of age, are often deeply unaware of how their expenses are managed by the institution. They do not have to think about arranging funds for their routine an d non - routine expenses 

The Sustainable Development Goals also highlight the need for 

“decent work” for everyone. 

Prerana Practices Core competence or job skill in a relevant trade is an essential condition but it is not sufficient to get a sustainable job. Other skills such as participating in group discussions, interviewing, essay writing, performance in personality - tests, aptitude t ests, etiquettes, and manners are very important to land a job. 

rerana conducts a one - on - one discussion with the residents about these essential skills, and also partners with corporates and other agencies to professionally train the girls. 

5.4. Life Skills 5.4.1. Access to Life Skills According to UNICEF, life skills are the “psychosocial abilities for adaptive and positive behavior that enable individuals to deal effectively w ith the demands and challenges of everyday life.” 

p. 58

Using the internet responsibly, operating smartphones, taking care of oneself, building relationships responsibly, at work and beyond, etc. are essential to lead a self - reliant life. Apart from that, life skills include making decisions, cultivating empathy, understanding issues of discrimination, peer pressure, self - image, self - esteem, etc. 

Prerana Practices Prerana imparts life skill training through individual and group sessions. These include sessions on understanding relationships, self & social acceptance, problem - solving skills, sex education, essentials of small - group living, self - regulation, peer pressure, consent culture, evolving code of conduct, training on security and pr otection, learning division of work and responsibilities and more recently, cyber safety. 

5.4.2. Access to Leisure and Recreation Recreation and leisure are a right of every child and should not be perceived as a luxury. It is important to encourage the resident to engage in constructive recreation and leisure for their well - being. Leisure can be defined as ‘free - time’ when no one is expected to work. Recreation is a fun and relaxing activity of positive entertainment. 

The victims of CSE and other forms of violence have a background of traumatic experiences. Their lives at the CCIs, the uncertainties about the future, and apprehensions of entering the society adds to that stress — and can adversely affect their physical and mental health as well their decision - making capacity. Leisure and recreation go a long way in helping the children destress themselves. 

Life skills are different from vocation skills and are of three types: cognitive 13 SDG 8 promotes sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all. 48 skills for analyzing and using information, personal skills for developing personal agency and managing oneself, and interper sonal skills for communicating and interacting effectively with others. 

p. 59

5.4.3. Access to Independent Living Skills Independence is not to be understood as leading an unbridled or asocial life. Instead, independent living skills focus on self - regulation and taking responsibility for one's actions. 

Prerana Practices As an integral part of its on - going casework, Prerana conducts regular sessions on small group living. It provides handholding support to the residents, especially during their first year of transition from CCIs to GH - EA. Prerana undertakes the following activities: ● Helps to open, access, and operate email accounts ● Assists in preparing and updating CV or resumes ● Guides in budgeting and living within one's means ● Orients the residents on how to interact at the police station and educates them on their rights. ● Helps residents to travel independently using publ ic transport ● Assists them in learning to cook for a small group, and understanding the importance of a balanced diet ● Helps residents interact with their immediate social environment, including the neighborhood committees. ● Teaches residents about the basics of banking, including opening a bank account, updating passbooks, etc. ● Trains the residents on handling Gazettes ● Helps them access helplines and other support services

● Teaches them to shop for essentials and groceries 

Prerana also encourages the residents to share about their relationships if they feel comfortable to do so. If a resident wants to get married, she is provided with counseling to ensure that she knows what her decision would entail. Prerana also offers to meet with the prospective husband and/or his family only if the resident desires so. Prerana also explains to them the importance o f getting their marriage legally registered and shares information on how to go about it. To ensure the access to independent living skills, Prerana undertakes the following activities: ● Conducts visits to the GH and engages with residents individually as well as in group discussions. ● Accompanies the residents to banks, markets, police stations, etc. ● Assists residents in understanding and responding to notices received from various autho rities.

● Educates the residents about the landlord - tenant relationship. ● Assists in managing finances. ● Facilitates regular training sessions as per the individual’s needs. ● Creates protocols, SOPs, guidelines through discussions and consultation with the resi dents. 

Challenges Faced When Addressing This Need The challenges faced by Prerana while addressing the development needs of the residents are: ● Location  of  the  GH - EA: The  GH  may  not  be  close  to  the schools/colleges/vocational centers of all the resid ents. Similarly, when it is time to move (in case the lease ends or for other reasons), finding a GH - EA with accessible services is challenging. ● Access to vocational training programs: Arranging programs for a small group of 5 to 6 residents with differen t needs and capabilities is resource intensive. Non - availability of training material and teachers is another hurdle. Residents who lose jobs require handholding from the organization externally assisting the GH. ● Personal motivation : Sometimes, it is hard to persuade young girls to choose sustainable vocational optio ns over short - term unsustainable ones. Residents tend to gravitate towards jobs that give them quick and short - term financial relief over a sustainable career option. ● Social vulnerabilities: Ma intaining confidentiality of the girls’ background and restricting their exposure to vulnerabilities at various stages is challenging. Thus, evolving and mainstreaming protection systems for care leavers become imperative. ● Navigating group dynamics : Some members may default and create liabilities, thereby endangering the very existence of the GH. Factionalism among the residents affects cohabitation and development of the individual’s capacities in a GH. Thus, it is critical to manage the number of residents in a GH - EA consistently.

SOCIAL REINTEGRATION 

6.1. Support Mechanisms 6.1.1. Access to Professional Follow - up Mechanisms Social reintegration is the process of transitioning into society after having spent a significant time in a CCI. 

It is now recognized widely that institutional life in itself brings certain challenges for its residents that may impact their ability to tra nsition into society. 

Prerana Practices The JJ system has a limited mandate for professional follow - up of the resident child once they complete 18 years of age. Prerana believes a child, even after completing 18 years, should remain in touch with the JJ system through professional follow - up mech anisms for some time to ensure their well - being and benefit from the safety net. 

Prerana believes that access to rehabilitation ser vices is required in aftercare until the care leavers — especially the victims of CSE — can sustain and lead their lives on their own. Prerana works with the CWC and ensures that a Follow - up Order is passed before the person turns 18 years, wherever needed. Su pport groups also play a role in fulfilling needs such as shelter, health care, legal aid, development, and social reintegration. 

p. 64

To ensure timely phase - out, Prerana transitions from in - person interactions to telephonic follow - up as a first step. Then, follow - ups are moved from weekly to monthly and quarterly basis. Slowly, financial assistance is also withdrawn as the young adult be comes more independent. 

Prerana maintains contacts with the young care leavers until they exit the GH - EA and keeps the option open for need - based contact. 

6.2. Stakeholder Engagement 6.2.1. Community Preparedness In cases of CSE, there is a possibility that the victim might go back to the original community. In such a case, the victim must be prepared to protect oneself. In the c ase of residents who are earning, there may be pressure from families to return back home and contribute financially to the household. However, returning to their families may not always be in their best interest. Thus, it is important for the family and c ommunity to support (if genuinely interested) in evaluating if the move back to the family is the best move for the victim. In extreme situations, the family and the community may even try to disrupt the GH activity as a pressure tactic 

p. 65

Challenges Faced While Addressing This Need Some of the challenges associated with social reintegration include: ● Institutional challenges: The facilitating organizations of GH - EA can find it difficult to transition from being actively involved in providing care and protection to facilitating externally and thereby assisting the young adults. ● Dependence on CSO and vice versa: Victim’s excess ive reliance on the CSO and unwillingness to wean off from the support is also a challenge while reintegrating residents. On the other hand, the externally assisting organization might also take undue interest in the lives of the residents and patronize th em. Unwillingness on the part of the organization to actively make the resident independent and thereby withdraw support. ● Social vulnerabilities: A child victim of CSE could become freshly vulnerable as she gains the newly acquired freedom. The family and the community of the resident may try to disrupt the Group Home.
