## Scope & Description: 
This paper covers possible theories and interventions to support resilience in children growing up in institutions in India



## Shortcomings of deinstitutionalisation
- Despite the observed shortcomings of the institutional model of care, child welfare researchers and practitioners foresee multiple practical constraints in a radical transition to a comprehensive family-oriented child welfare system (McCall, 2013 ). 
- Some of these are cultural, religious, political or historical reasons posing as significant challenges in recruiting people to foster; couples getting listed as foster parents deliberately to claim the benefits and; a greater likelihood of infants and young children to be taken up, leaving the older or disabled ones behind 
- Worthy of consideration is also the observation that no matter how persistent a nation gets at de-institutionalization, a good proportion of children will still be left from family-based placements. 
- Recently, Ukraine made a commendable effort at de-institutionalization. Yet, it was found that despite persistent efforts, while 1750 children were adopted and 5000 were put into the foster system, 45,000 of them were still left behind in the institutions (Groark, McCall, & Li, 2009). 
- Against these real and probable realities, then, advocates within the field believe that there is a need to rely on more actual than aspirational goals for child welfare practice and policy (Gilligan, 1997).
-  Consequently, building resilience has been emphasized in significantly contributing towards responding to child care problems and needs (Gilligan, 1997; Pop, 2018) until the picture of alternate care changes in countries like India. 

# Resilience and Child-welfare 
- Researchers believe that children entering institutional care face dual risks, those emanating from their pre-admission circumstances, and those related to the institutional care itself (Rutter and Quinton, 1984). 

## Pre-admission risk factors
- Studies have reported that orphaned children are exposed to multi - ple pre-admission stressors (Foster, Makufa, Drew, Mashumba, & Kambeu, 1997). 
- Some of these include providing care to an extremely sick parent, home and school relocation, separation from siblings, child labour to provide to the family financially, unstable living conditions, and abuse mostly after losing a parent. 
- Psychopathology, in the form of anxiety, depression and anti-social acts has been associated with child - hood exposure to traumatic events (Koenig, Doll, O ’ Leary, & Pequegnat, 2004; Matshalaga & Powell, 2002). 
- These make progression well into adulthood, manifesting as high-risk behaviors (Whetten et al., 2014). 
- Utilizing a life-events checklist (Gray, Litz, Hsu, & Lombardo, 2004), Positive Outcomes for Orphans study (Whetten, 2009) found most or - phans experienced at least one negative life event, in addition to the death of a parent or abandonment (98%). More than half experienced four or more such events (55%). Most commonly reported events in the study were the death of a family member, physical and sexual abuse, and witnessing family violence. 

## Post-admission risk factors
- As mentioned in Section 1.2.1 , children entering substitute care have a history of adverse psychosocial experiences. 
- Controversial and exciting then, have been speculations regarding whether the high rates of psychological and behavioral disturbance seen in these children result from vulnerability arising out of early adverse experiences or a result of being raised in atypical living circumstances. 

## Protective factors in child welfare settings 
- Studies have reported initial negative experiences for older children when institutionalization occurs, but then the institution gradually as - sumes a positive connotation to form a support network. 
- Emphasis has been placed on close human relationships, including members of an informal support network, who act beyond their typical role boundaries (resident or school peers, relatives, and community members) as a resource fostering perceived safety, feelings of being accepted and loved among young people in public care. 
-  Acknowledging achievement, knowledge about daily living like shopping, public transport, food preparation, taking care of oneself that enhanced ex- residents ’ confidence for independent living as factors aiding in the social reintegration of institutionalized girls in India. 
- On the whole, though very limited, qualitative studies have been influential in bringing forth positive narratives of institutionalization, governed by a welcoming environment that can foster well-being, desirable positive outcomes and a context providing an opportunity for meaningful interpersonal relationships
- The desire to break through one ’ s adversity. This desire further provides the fuel that enhances the protective value of resources encountered post-institutional admission. In other words, each of these resources assumes their protective role by tapping on to this personal desire. Once re-awakened, it provides a potential goal to work towards throughout the stay, thereby aiding one to get adjusted at one ’ s new residence. 

## Factors that influence resilience in institutional care
 
 - We then describe all the six categories: **being guided; having significant adults; emulating strength from the collective; institutional environment being preferable over the home environment; managing oneself and institutional admission as a blessing in disguise.** 

### Guidance
 - A majority of the participants recalled being directionless and helpless on arrival at the facility. Interviews showed that such a vulnerability makes a newcomer more receptive to guiding adults around. This guidance was found to have helped re-awakening their once dormant desire to improve the course of one ’ s life by suggesting a possible route 
 - Findings showed that within this same group of participants, those who could not receive any guidance at the time of institutional admis - sion, face risks to remain devoid of a purpose. But the study found that this does not necessarily mean they don ’ t get adjusted. 

### Significant adults

- Initial maintenance: Having significant adults Findings showed that most participants had an important adult in their lives, mostly a surviving parent or a grandparent and, in a few cases, an older sibling, a teacher or the institution warden. 
- Participants in the present study shared a view that suffering creates aspirations. It was unanimously iterated that the adverse childhood circumstances had been solely responsible for cultivating a need to do something about their lives. Besides, the participants viewed their family disruptions and subsequent admissions as blessings in disguise, as these provided an escape from a life replete with deprivation and abuse. 

### Managing one's own
- Findings showed that as children mature, they become capable of indulging in specific practical strategies that help them persevere during a crisis. 
- One of the strategies being talked about was being aware that one is on one ’ s own.
-  It comes either in the form of realizing the lack of available back-ups beyond the institution from where material support in future can be derived or acknowledging and accepting the re - sponsibility that has fallen solely on one ’ s shoulders to take care of those left behind.
-  It serves to foster independence and prompts adolescents to take good care of themselves since there is no one to come to their rescue if something happened to them. 

### Belief that institutional care is a blessing
- Suggesting a possible route to positive adaptation among the recipients of institutional care. This area has not received due attention in recent years. It offers crucial insights on how the interplay of personal and environmental assets can bring forth adjustment to an atypical living arrangement, in a way that also aids in restructuring one ’ s past adver - sities in a positive light. 


## Suggestions for interventions to improve resilience

- This research was successful in identifying several pit-stops for best practices within CCIs. 
- Based on the findings, we have identified prom - inent roles of counsellors (including peer counsellors) and caretakers. 
- Although, there is a need for each of these care agents to have specified roles (career guidance, training peer counsellors and trauma counselling for counsellors; managing in-house peer relations, cooperating with the residents on practical issues by the caretakers, etc.); the authors would particularly like to highlight areas of combined responsibilities. 

### Guidance 
- As suggested by the study ’ s findings, one of the most promising areas for intervention among institutionalized children and adolescents has been guidance given to them, either before or soon after their place - ments. 
- Trained peers, counsellors and caretakers can together take up the responsibility to
	-  (a) Help the newcomer carefully assess the pros and cons (resource-wise) of residing in an institution relative to the home environment, and 
	- (b) cultivate a sense of purpose in life, and bring the newcomer to a position where he/she realizes the value of having access to resources that ensure goal achievement.
- Findings of this research suggest that one of the primary areas where children in institutional placements might need guidance is in showing them the way ahead, i.e. helping them channelize their sense of help - lessness and help them envision a positive future.

### Appreciating the power of positive role models 
- Our findings provide essential leads regarding the power of role models in prescribing guidelines for behavior and instilling positive expectations. 
- Counsellors and caretakers can make active efforts to become exemplars of resilience by incorporating relevant self- disclosure. 
- Caretakers can invite alumni who have gone to achieve success in their respective career paths. 
- Utilization of audio-visual aids (like documentaries and movies) can help communicate the message of perseverance and hope quite impactfully.

### Providing opportunities for identification of interests and talents 
- This research found that providing ample opportunities to young people to discover their interests and talents can help them achieve a future vision. 
- It can play a crucial role in removing future uncertainty and fostering hope in achieving the desired life. 

### Addressing barriers to resilience-promoting processes
- Addressing specific barriers to attaining positive outcomes remains critical in having resident children access resilience-promoting ecolog - ical resources. 
- Responsibility of the CCIs to provide equal opportunities to both male and female residents in accessing curricular and extra- curricular resources has been identified in this study as governing female residents ’ satisfaction from their institutions. 
- In addition, ensuring conducive in-house peer relations remains a vital responsibility of the caretaking staff to make institutional stay a protective and fulfilling experience for its residents.
-  Finally, a need for sufficient training of the institutional staff in learning positive disciplinary strategies cannot be undermined, as incidents of abuse within institutional facilities defeat the whole purpose of substitute care.
