## National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad

Below poverty line: he expenditure needed to obtain, on an average, 2400 Kcal per capita per day in the rural areas and 2100 Kcal in urban areas. 


# Nutrition related problems:


* Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM), micronutrient deficiencies such as vitamin A deficiency (VAD) , Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA), Iodine Deficiency Disorders(IDD) and vitamin B-complex deficiencies are the nutrition problems frequently encountered, particularly among the rural poor and urban slum communities.
* Long-term malnutrition leads to stunting and wasting, non-communicable chronic diet related disorders, increased morbidity and mortality and reduced physical work output.
* Though the prevalence of florid forms of severe PEM like kwashiorkor and marasmus among preschool children is &lt;1 %, national surveys indicate that about half of (48%) &lt;5 year children suffer from subclinical undernutrition such as underweight (43%) stunting and wasting (20%) which indicates that undernutrition is of long duration
* The studies have shown that there is a steep increase in the prevalence of underweight with increase of age, from 27% at 6 months of age to a high of 45% at 24 months of age
* In the case of vitamin A deficiency, 0.81% of preschool children show the signs of Bitot's spots and night blindness
*  Among children between the ages of 6 and 59 months, a majority (70%) are anemic. N
* About 167 million are estimated to be living in IDD endemic areas. Iodine deficiency causes goiter (enlargement of thyroid gland in the neck), neonatal hypothyroidism, cretinism among new borns, mental retardation, delayed motor development, stunting, deaf-mutism and neuromuscular disorders.
* 

Diet consisting of foods from several food groups provides all the required nutrients in proper amounts.

 *Highlight [page 22]:* _Cereals, millets and pulses are major sources of most nutrients.

 *Highlight [page 22]:* _Milk which provides good quality proteins and calcium must be an essential item of the diet, particularly for infants, children and women.

 *Highlight [page 22]:* _Oils and nuts are calorie-rich foods, and are useful for increasing the energy density and quality of food.

 *Highlight [page 22]:* _Inclusion of eggs, flesh foods and fish enhances the quality of diet. However, vegetarians can derive almost all the nutrients from diets consisting of cereals, pulses, vegetables, fruits and milk-based diets.

 *Highlight [page 22]:* minerals/ phytonutrients.


###  Carbohydrates



* They provide energy of 4 Kcal/g.
* The simple carbohydrates, glucose and fructose, are found in fruits, vegetables and honey, sucrose in sugar and lactose in milk, while the complex polysaccharides are starches in cereals, millets, pulses and root vegetables and glycogen in animal foods.
* the other complex carbohydrates which are resistant to digestion in the human digestive tract are cellulose in vegetables and whole grains, and gums and pectins in vegetables, fruits and cereals, which constitute the dietary fibre component
* In India, 70-80% of total dietary calories are derived from carbohydrates present in plant foods such as cereals, millets and pulses.
* Dietary fibre delays and retards absorption of carbohydrates and fats and increases the satiety value. 
* Diets rich in fibre reduce glucose and lipids in blood and increase the bulk of the stools. 
* Diets rich in complex carbohydrates are healthier than low-fibre diets based on refined and processed food


### Proteins



* Provide energy (4 Kcal/g).
* More proteins are required by growing infants and children, pregnant women and individuals during infections and illness or stress
*  Animal foods like milk, meat, fish and eggs and plant foods such as pulses and legumes are rich sources of proteins. 
* Animal proteins are of high quality as they provide all the essential amino acids in right proportions, while plant or vegetable proteins are not of the same quality because of their low content of some of the essential amino acids. 
* However, a combination of cereals, millets and pulses provides most of the amino acids, which complement each other to provide better quality proteins.


### Fats



* Oils and fats such as butter, ghee and vanaspathi constitute dietary visible fats. 
* Fats are a concentrated source of energy providing 9 Kcal/g
* Dietary fats are derived from two sources viz. the invisible fat present in plant and animal foods; and the visible or added fats and oils (cooking oil).
* Fats serve as a vehicle for fat-soluble vitamins like vitamins A, D, E and K and carotenes and promote their absorption.
* The type and quantity of fat in the daily diet influence the level of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood.
* **Diets should include adequate amounts of fat particularly in the case of infants and children, to provide concentrated energy since their energy needs per kg body weight are nearly twice those of adults.**


### Vitamins



* Required by the body in small amounts. They must be present in the diet as they cannot be synthesized in the body
* Vitamins are essential for numerous body processes and for maintenance of the structure of skin, bone, nerves, eye, brain, blood and mucous membrane
* They are either water-soluble or fat-soluble. 
    * Vitamins A, D, E and K are fat-soluble, while vitamin C, and the B-complex vitamins such as thiamin (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin, pyridoxine (B6), folic acid and cyanocobalamin (B12) are water-soluble. 
    * Fat-soluble vitamins can be stored in the body while water-soluble vitamins are not and get easily excreted in urine. 
    * Vitamins B-complex and C are heat labile vitamins and are easily destroyed by heat, air or during drying, cooking and food processing.


### Minerals



* The important macro minerals are sodium,potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and sulphur, while zinc, copper, selenium, molybdenum, fluorine, cobalt, chromium and iodine are micro minerals. 
* They are required for maintenance and integrity of skin, hair, nails, blood and soft tissues. They also govern nerve cell transmission, acid/base and fluid balance, enzyme and hormone activity as well as the blood- clotting processes

**Balanced Diet: A balanced diet should provide around 50-60% of total calories from carbohydrates, preferably from complex carbohydrates, about 10-15% from proteins and 20-30% from both visible and invisible fat.**


### Iron



* Iron is needed for hemoglobin synthesis, mental function and to provide immunity against diseases.
* Iron deficiency during pregnancy increases maternal mortality and low birth weight infants. In children, it increases susceptibility to infection and impairs learning ability.
* Vitamin C rich foods must be consumed daily to improve iron absorption


###  Vitamin A



* This fat-soluble vitamin is necessary for clear vision in dim light, and for maintaining the integrity of epithelial tissues. 
* In vitamin A deficiency, the white of the eye (conjunctiva) loses its luster and becomes dry. 
* In severe vitamin A deficiency, the black area of the eye (cornea) gets necrosed, leading to irreversible blindness in young children. 
* Vitamin A also has a role in maintaining resistance of the body to common infections. 
* Carotenoids are plentiful in fruits and vegetables that are green or deep yellow/orange in colour, such as green leafy vegetables, carrots, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, papaya, mango etc.


### Vitamin C 



* Vitamin C is an essential nutrient required for healthy bones and teeth. 
* It also promotes iron absorption. 
* Vitamin C deficiency is characterised by weakness, bleeding gums and defective bone growth. 
* Vitamin C is abundantly available in fresh amla, citrus fruits, guava, banana and certain vegetables such as tomatoes. 
* However, it is very susceptible to destruction by atmospheric oxidation. 
* It is for this reason that when vegetables become dry and stale or cut and exposed to air most of the vitamin C originally present is destroyed.


### Folic acid 



* Folic acid is a haemopoietic vitamin essential for multiplication and maturation of red cells in our body. 
* Its deficiency leads to megaloblastic anaemias. 
* Folic acid intake during pregnancy protects the foetus from developing certain congenital defects. It also promotes the birth weight of infants. 
* Folic acid deficiency increases homocysteine levels in blood, thereby increasing the risk for heart disease. 
* Green leafy vegetables, legumes, nuts and liver are good sources of folates.


### Calories



* Large intake of low calorie vegetables and fruits can help in reducing calories in diet and help in obesity management. 
* On the other hand vegetables like colocasia, potato, tapioca, yam, sweet potato and fruits like banana, avocado pear (215 Kcal) and mahua (111 Kcal) have more than 100 kcal per 100gram


### Dietary Fibre 

Dietary fibre delays the intestinal transit of the food consumed. 

Dietary fibre is important for proper bowel function, to reduce chronic constipation, diverticular disease, haemorrhoids coronary heart diseases, diabetes and obesity. 

They also reduce plasma cholesterol. T

he protective role of dietary fibre against colon cancer has long been recognised.


### Antioxidants



* Antioxidants restrict the damage that reactive oxygen free radicals can cause to the cell and cellular components
*  Raw and fresh vegetables like green leafy vegetables, carrots, fresh fruits including citrus and tomatoes have been identified as good sources of antioxidants (free radicalscavengers). 
* The nutrients vitamin C and carotenoids that are present in these vegetables are also potential antioxidants. Different colored vegetable provide different antioxidants


### Fats



* Fats are essential for meeting some of the nutritional needs like essential fatty acids and serve as rich sources of energy. 
* Fats should be consumed in moderation.
*  Fats also promote the absorption of the four fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E and K), impart a feeling of fullness and satisfaction and thus, delay the onset of hunger
* Dietary fats can be derived from plant and animal sources. 
* Fats that are used as such at the table or during cooking (vegetable oils, vanaspati, butter and ghee) are “visible fat”
* Fats that are present as an integral components of various foods are referred to as “invisible” fat. 
* Fats, in processed and ready to eat foods are known as hidden fats. Cereals contain only 2-3% of invisible fat.
*  The total fat (visible + invisible) in the diet should provide between 20-30% of total calories.
* The higher fat and EFA requirements during pregnancy and lactation are to meet the requirements of fetus and young infants, in view of their crucial role in physical and neuronal growth and development


#### Fatty acids

All fats in foods provide mixtures of three types of fatty acids, which are the “building blocks” of fats.

Fats from coconut oil, vanaspati, animal fats (ghee and butter) and animal foods like milk, milk products and meat provide saturated fatty acids. 

The short and medium chain saturated fatty acids present in ghee, butter and coconut oil are easily digested and absorbed and are therefore, good for infants and young children. 


#### Cholesterol



* Cholesterol is present only in foods of animal origin such as milk, meat, shrimp and prawn, but not in plant foods. 
* Vegetable oils do not contain cholesterol. 
* Egg yolk, and organ meats such as liver, kidney and brain contain very high amounts of cholesterol. 
* Cholesterol is found in all body cells and plays a key role in the formation of brain, nerve tissue and is a pre-cursor for some hormones and vitamin D. 
* One can reduce both saturated fat and cholesterol intake by limiting the consumption of high-fat animal foods like butter, ghee, meat, egg and organ meats and consuming low fat (skimmed) milk instead of whole milk. 
* Consumption of eggs (3eggs/ week) is recommended in view of several nutritional advantages.


## Food Groups:



1. Cereals, millets and pulses 
2. Milk and milk products, egg, meat and fish 
3. Vegetables and fruits 
4. Oils & fats and nuts & oilseeds




## Required Dietary Allowances



* Requirements are the quantities of nutrients that healthy individuals must obtain from food to meet their physiological needs. 
* The recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) are estimates of nutrients to be consumed daily to ensure the requirements of all individuals in a given population.
* The RDAs are suggested for physiological groups such as infants, pre-schoolers, children, adolescents, pregnant women, lactating mothers, and adult men and women, taking into account their physical activity

Below is taken from Annexure 3 from PDF titled - Recommended Dietary Allowances for Indians


# Useful Care Practice Tips that pop out in paper



* Use a combination of whole grains, grams and greens. Include jaggery or sugar and cooking oils to bridge the calorie or energy gap.
* Fresh fruits are nutritionally superior to fruit juices
* How should vegetables and fruits be consumed
    * Include commonly consumed leafy greens, tomatoes and other vegetables, apart from those which are yellow, orange, red, deep red, purple colored citrus fruits, being vitamin C-rich enrich the diets significantly.
* For the growth of young children high-calorific diets are required. This is achieved by inclusion of adequate amounts of fat (1g fat = 9 Kcals) in their diets as they cannot consume large quantities of bulky cereal - pulse- based diets.
* Diets of young children and adolescents should contain about 30-50g/day.
* The short and medium chain saturated fatty acids present in ghee, butter and coconut oil are easily digested and absorbed and are therefore, good for infants and young children. 
* Substitute part of visible fat and invisible fat from animal foods with whole nuts.
* Moderate the use of animal foods containing high fat, SFA and cholesterol.
* Limit the use of ghee, butter, especially vanaspati as a cooking oil. 
* Choose low- fat dairy foods in place of regular whole fat dairy foods. 
* Eat foods rich in alpha-linolenic (ALA) acid such as legumes, green leafy vegetables, fenugreek and mustard seeds.
* Eat fish more frequently (at least 100-200g /week), prefer it to meat, poultry and limit/ avoid organ meats such as liver, kidney, brain etc. 
* Egg has several important nutrients but is high in cholesterol. Limit the consumption to 3 eggs/ week. However, egg white may be consumed in good amounts.
* Use of re-heated fats and oils should be avoided.


# Dietary Guide for Pregnant Women



* The daily diet of a woman should contain an additional 350 calories, 0.5 g of protein during first trimester and 6.9 g during second trimester and 22.7 g during third trimester of pregnancy. 
* Folic acid, taken throughout the pregnancy, reduces the risk of congenital malformations and increases the birth weight
* Calcium is essential, both during pregnancy and lactation, for proper formation of bones and teeth of the offspring, for secretion of breast-milk rich in calcium and to prevent osteoporosis in the mother.
* Iodine intake ensures proper mental health of the growing fetus and infant
* Vitamin A is required during lactation to improve child survival. Besides these, nutrients like vitamins B and C need to be taken by the lactating mother.
* Foods for pregnant women
    * She can derive maximum amount of energy (about 60%) from rice, wheat and millets
    * Bioavailability of iron can be improved by using fermented and sprouted grams and foods rich in vitamin C such as citrus fruits. 
    * Milk is the best source of biologically available calcium. 
    * Though it is possible to meet the requirements for most of the nutrients through a balanced diet, pregnant/lactating women are advised to take daily supplements of iron, folic acid, vitamin B 12and calcium
    * Salt intake should not be restricted even to prevent pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia. 
    * Excess intake of beverages containing caffeine like coffee and tea adversely affect fetal growth and hence, should be avoided.
    * Take iron, folate and calcium supplements regularly, after 14-16 weeks of pregnancy and continue the same during lactation.


## Breastfeeding



* Exclusive breastfeeding for six months and encourage breastfeeding till two years or more, if possible
* Breastast-milk is the most natural and perfect food for normal growth and healthy development of infants.
* Colostrum, which is the milk secreted during the first 34 days after child birth, is rich in proteins, minerals, vitamins especially vitamin A and antibodies. In addition, it has a laxative effect as well.
* Breast-feeding reduces risk of infections.Recent evidence suggests that human milk may confer some long term benefits such as lower risk of certain autoimmune diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity and related disorders and probably some cancers.
* In addition to providing nutrients, breast-milk has several special components such as growth factors, enzymes, hormones and anti-infective factors.
* **Breast-milk provides good quality proteins, fat, vitamins, calcium, iron and other minerals up to 4-6 months**.
* In fact, quality of some of the nutrients can be improved by supplementing the diet of the mother with nutrient
* Breast feeding is associated with better cognitive development possibly due to the high content of docosahexaeonic acid (DHA) which plays an important role in brain development.
* Mothers can breast-feed from as early as 30 minutes after delivery. **Colostrum should be made available to the infant immediately after birth**
* Composition of breast-milk depends to some extent on maternal nutrition. Supplementation of vitamins A and B-complex to lactating mothers increases the levels of these vitamins in breast-milk
* Breast milk protects against infection
    * Diseases and death among breast-fed infants are much lower than those among formula-fed infants
    * Breast-feeding protects against diarrhoea and upper respiratory tract infections.
    * The bifidus factor in breast-milk promotes the natural gut flora
* Frequent sucking by the baby and complete emptying of breast are important for sustaining adequate breast milk output.
* HIV may be transmitted from mother to infant through breast milk. 
    * When replacement feeding is not acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable and safe (AFASS), exclusive breast-feeding is recommended during the first months of life
    * Every effort should be made to promote exclusive breast-feeding for up to four months in the case of HIV positive mothers followed by weaning, and complete stoppage of breast feeding at six months in order to restrict transmission through breast feeding.


### Infant Feeding



* A baby should be exclusively breast-fed only up to 6 months and complementary foods should be introduced thereafter.
* Breast-feeding can be continued as long as possible, even up to 2 years.
* If babies are quiet or sleep for 2 hours after a feed and show adequate weight gain, feeding may be assumed as adequate.
* Breast-fed infants do not need additional water. Feeding water reduces the breast milk intake and increases the risk of diarrhoea and should, therefore, be avoided. Giving additional water is unnecessary even in hot climate.
* Introduction of food supplements (semi-solid complementary foods) along with breast-feeding is necessary for infants after 6 months of age.
* Supplementary foods: liquids like milk or semi-solids like 'kheer' in the case of infants or solid preparations like rice etc., in the case of children over the age of one year.
* Low-cost food supplements can be prepared at home from commonly used ingredients such as cereals (wheat, rice, ragi, jowar, bajra, etc.); pulses (grams/ dhals), nuts and oilseeds (groundnut, sesame, etc.), oils (groundnut oil, sesame oil etc.) and sugar and jaggery. Such supplements are easily digested by all infants, including those with severe malnutrition.
* Infants can also be fed green leafy vegetables (GLVs), which are rich, yet inexpensive, sources of vitamins and minerals. However, greens should be well cleaned before cooking lest the infants develop loose motions.it is advisable to initially feed only the juice of the GLVs after cooking them properly
* In families which can afford egg yolk and meat soup can be introduced
* At about one year of age, the child should share the family diet.
* **Infants should be fed small quantities at frequent intervals (3-4 times a day). Also, the food should be of semi-solid consistency for easy swallowing.**


#### What are the hygienic practices to be adopted for infants?



* Vegetables should be washed well to remove contaminants/ parasites/ pesticides before cutting
* Vegetables should preferably be steam-cooked to reduce cooking losses
* utensils used for cooking should be thoroughly washed or sterilized
* foods should be stored in clean bottles or tins


#### What should be done if breast milk is not adequate?



* The infant needs to be fed animal milk or commercial infant formula.
    * Milk should be boiled before being fed to the baby
    * To start with, milk may be diluted with an equal volume of water.
    * Full strength milk may be started from 4 weeks of age
* Infants fed animal milk should receive supplements of iron and vitamin C.
* About 120-180 ml of milk should be fed with one teaspoon of sugar per feed, 6-8 times over the day
* While reconstituting the infant formula, the instructions given on the label should be strictly followed.
* The feeds should be prepared and given using a sterile cup, spoon, bottles and nipples taking utmost care
* Overfeeding should be avoided in artificially-fed infants to prevent obesity. 
* Low-cost home-made complementary foods should be preferred.


# Diets for children and adolescents (both in health and sickness) 


## How Children grow



* An infant grows rapidly, doubling its birth weight by 5 months and tripling it by 1 year of age.
* During the second year, the child increases not only in height by 7-8 cm but also gains 4 times of its birth weight.
* During the pre-adolescent period the child grows, on an average, 6-7 cm in height and 1.5 to 3 kg in weight every year and simultaneously development and maturation of various tissues and organs take place
* Adolescent period (teenage) is characterized by rapid increase in height and weight, hormonal changes, sexual maturation and wide swings in emotion. 
    * Adolescent growth spurt starts at about 10-12 years in girls and two years later in boys. 
    * The annual peak rates for height and weight are 9-10 cm and 8-10 kg.
    * Development of critical bone mass is essential during this period as this forms the ground for maintaining mineral integrity of the bone in later life. The pattern and proportion of various body components like body water, muscle mass, bone and fat increase during the entire childhood and adolescence to reach adult values by about 18 years.
    * Adolescent girls are at greater physiological stress than boys because of menstruation. Their nutritional needs are of particular importance as they have to prepare for motherhood. 


## Dietary Guide for growing children

Refer WHO Growth Standards



* Growing children and adolescents require more calcium (about 600-800 mg/day). Have calcium rich foods like milk and milk products, fox tail millet (Ragi), til etc.
* Young children below the age of 5 years should be given less bulky foods, rich in energy and protein such as legumes, pulses, nuts, edible oil/ghee, sugar, milk and eggs. 
* Vegetables including green leafy vegetables and locally available seasonal fruits should be part of their daily menu. 
* Snacks make a useful contribution to the nutrient requirements, particularly in older children and adolescents. 
* Older children and adolescents should consume plenty of milk to fulfill the high calcium requirements. 
* Cooking oils/ghee (25-50g) should be consumed. 
* Overindulgence in fats may be avoided. 
* Excessive salt intake should be avoided particularly by children having a family history of hypertension.
* In addition to consumption of a nutritious well balanced diet, appropriate lifestyle practices and involvement in physical activity such as games/sports should be encouraged among children and adolescents.


## Infections can lead to malnutrition



* Common childhood infections like diarrhea, measles and pneumonia occur in association with malnutrition and contribute to about 70% of mortality.
* During periods of infection, children tend to eat less due to reduced appetite. Many children vomit frequently. Nutrients are also lost in urine and feces. 
* The unhealthy practice of restricting diet, including breast-feeding, by the mother during any sickness could further aggravate the problem. Hence, extra care is needed in feeding the child appropriately during and after illness to prevent subsequent nutritional deficiencies
* A child needs to eat more during and after episodes of infections to maintain good nutritional status 
    * Breast-feeds are often well accepted and tolerated even by sick children and should be continued except in severe gastroenteritis associated with shock. 
    * For older children, consuming an adult diet, soft cooked food may be offered at frequent intervals.
    * The quantity of the feeds may be increased, after the illness has subsided, till the original weight is regained.


###  Infection - Diarrhea



* The child requires prompt correction of fluid and electrolyte loss using oral rehydration solution (ORS) along with appropriate/adequate feeding.
* ORS can be prepared by adding a pinch of salt (between thumb and index finger) and a teaspoon of sugar to a glass of potable water. 
* Home-made fluids such as rice kanji or buttermilk with salt can also be used. 
* During infections, children should frequently be given small quantities of fluids by mouth, including plain water. 
* During diarrhea, feeding should be continued, though this goes against the popular practice. 
* Breast-milk promotes sodium and water transport across the gut and, thus, prevents dehydration and weight loss, in addition to providing other nutrients.
* The diet of 1-2 year old children with diarrhea should provide energy of about 1000 Kcal/day. Calorie-rich, semi-solid, soft diets may be prepared from a variety of cereals and pulses.
* Sprouted grains are easily digestible and provide good nutrition.
* Fat and sugar help in reducing the bulk of the diets and make them energy dense. 
* Milk may be mixed with cereal diet to avoid lactose malabsorption. If milk is not tolerated, it may be replaced by an equal volume of curd/yogurt/soymilk. 
* Mashed vegetables may be incorporated in the diet.
* About 6-8 feeds should be given during the day so that the extra food (120-140 Kcal/kg) may be consumed by the child without any difficulty.


### Infection - Lactose Intolerance 



* This problem can be overcome by reducing the quantity of milk taken at a time or taking milk along with a cereal-pulse meal.
* In such children, milk may be stopped temporarily. A diet based on cereals and pulses or chicken and egg white allows the gut to recover and milk can then be slowly introduced.

 *Highlight [page 48]:* EAT CALCIUM-RICH FOODS _Calcium is needed for growth and bone development. _Children require more calcium. _Calcium prevents osteoporosis (thinning of bones). _Milk, curds and nuts are rich sources of bio-available calcium (Ragi and GLV are also good dietary sources of calcium). _Regular exercise reduces calcium loss from bones. _Exposure to sunlight maintains vitamin D status which helps in calcium absorption. DURING ILLNESS _Never starve the child. _Feed energy-rich cereals-pulse diet with milk and mashed vegetables. _Feed small quantities at frequent intervals. _Continue breast-feeding as long as possible. _Give plenty of fluids during illness. _Use oral rehydration solution to prevent and correct dehydration during diarrhea episodes.


# Oils



* To make sure ideal quality fat for good health, shoice of cooking oil should be as follows: 
    * Groundnut/Sesame/Rice bran + Mustard 
    * Groundnut/Sesame/Rice bran + Canola
    * Groundnut/Sesame/Rice bran + Soyabean
    * Palmolein + Soybean
    * Safflower/Sunflower + Palmolein + Mustard


#### Note on Vanaspati (valid only if homes use this)



* Vanaspati is used as a substitute for ghee in cooking and the preparation of bakery products, sweets and snack foods. 
* Since, saturated fats are resistant to oxidation, foods prepared in vanaspati keep fresh for a longer period.
* Current evidence indicates that saturated fatty acids and a high intake of trans fatty acids may increase the risk of heart disease.
* Therefore, it is essential to limit the intake of vanaspati.


# Over weight and obesity



* The cut-off levels for categorizing overweight and obesity in children and adolescents are different. 
* Since, growth spurt in boys and girls occurs in different age groups, age and gender specific BMI centiles of reference population is used to assess their nutritional status. 
* Thus, children with BMI less than 5 thcentile are considered as undernourished and those with =5 thand &lt;85 thcentiles are normal, and with =85 thand &lt;95 thcentile are considered as overweight. 
* More than 95 thcentile are considered as obese.
* Over-feeding during infancy, childhood and adolescence predisposes to overweight/ obesity during adulthood. The tendency of familial obesity seems to be inherited. Eating junk or unhealthy foods coupled with low physical activity is considered as a main contributor.
* Low and high birth weight (&lt;2500 g and >3500g), obesity during childhood and adolescence are likely to lead to obesity in adults.
* Body weight must, therefore, be checked and monitored periodically.
* Several studies have suggested that hours spent in watching television is strongly associated with weight gain in childhood and adolescents, mostly due to the sedentary behavior, tendency to consume snack foods while watching television and influence of the advertisements of energy dense foods.
* In children, obesity should be controlled by increasing physical activity rather than restricting food intake


# Exercise & Physical Activity



* Children and teenagers need at least 60 minutes of physical activity every day.
* Types of physical activities
    * Aerobic activities: These speed your heart rate and breathing while improving heart and lung fitness. Examples: brisk walking, jogging and swimming. 
    * Resistance, strength building and weight-bearing activities: These help build and maintain bones and muscles by working them against gravity. Lifting weights, walking with child in arms are a few examples. 
    * Balance and stretching activities: Dancing, gentle stretching, yoga, martial arts and Tai chi reduce risk of injuries by improving physical stability and flexibility.


# Salt Intake



* Restrict the intake of added salt right from an early age
* Increased salt intake may pose health risk and may lead to hypertension and heart disease
* Sodium is primarily involved in the maintenance of water balance and equilibrium. It also plays an important role in electro-physiological functions of the cell.
* Natural diets, in general, provide about 300-400 mg of sodium a day.

 


# How do we select safe food?



* Some foods carry certification mark assuring good quality. For example AGMARK for honey and ghee; FPO (Fruit Products Order) for fruit and vegetable products (jams, squashes, etc); ISI (Bureau of Indian Standards) for food colours and essences. 
* While purchasing packaged food always look for ‘best before’ or ‘date of expiry’.
* Food grains purchased should be free from infestation and foreign matter (rodent excreta and insect remains). They should be of uniform size and should not be shrivelled, shrunken or mouldy. 
* Foodstuffs should be free from artificial colors. There is a risk of adulteration when fats/oils are purchased loose from unsealed containers.
* It is always safer to purchase reputed brand products in sealed sachets/containers. 
* It is necessary to buy pasteurized milk in sachets from a reputed dairy or a reliable vendor to avoid the risk of adulteration and contamination.
* Since powdered spices are more likely to be adulterated, always buy certified products. 
* Fruits and vegetables that show patches, physical damage with bruises or wilted and decayed with visible evidence of insects and moulds, should be avoided
* Whole spices, uniform in color, size and shape should be preferred.
* Eggs should be fresh and free from cracks. 
* Meat or poultry must be examined for characteristic color, odor and texture and should be purchased fresh or frozen.
* Freshness of fresh-water fish is indicated by a stiff body, bright, clear and bulging eyes, reddish gills, tight scales and absence of stale odor or discoloration. Fresh fish will not show any pitting on finger pressure.


# How to store food



* Agricultural commodities should be dried and adequately in a safe storage structure, to protect them from moisture and to prevent the damage from microbes like bacteria and mould producing toxins (eg. aflatoxins)
* Frequent and careful disinfestation of the storage premises using rodenticides like aluminium phosphide is essential.
* Some traditional household practices such as application of edible oils to grains, placing dried neem leaves in storage bins etc., are known to prevent infestations.


## How should perishable foods be handled ?



* Perishable foods like milk, meat, vegetables and cooked foods should be stored under refrigeration, preferably at a temperature of 10oc or less,
* Cross contamination can be avoided by keeping cooked and raw foods separately.
*  In case of food which is cooked, if not consumed immediately has to be stored for some time, it should be kept either hot (more than 60oc) or be cooled quickly (below 10oc).
* Most micro-organisms multiply at temperatures between 10 and 60 degree celcius.


## Personal Hygiene



* Food handlers should be free from obvious signs of illness, wounds and sores.
* Use of spoons and ladles should be encouraged to avoid contamination. 
* Hands should be washed thoroughly with soap before starting the preparation of food and after every interruption. 
* Household pets like cats and dogs should be kept away from places where food is cooked, stored or served.


# Cultural factors in dietary practices



* Exaggerated beneficial or harmful claims in respect of some foods, without scientific basis constitute food fads. 
* In addition, the belief of heat producing and cold inducing foods is widely prevalent. Some examples are jaggery, sugar, groundnuts, fried foods, mango, bajra, jowar, maize, eggs and meat. 
* Papaya fruit is strongly suspected to lead to abortion, though there is no scientific basis. 
* Buttermilk, curd, milk, green gram dhal, green leafy vegetables, ragi, barley flour and apples are considered as cold inducing foods which are actually nutritious. 
* Vegetarianism is often practiced in India on religious grounds. Since vitamin B12 is present only in foods of animal origin, vegetarians should ensure an adequate consumption of milk. 
* During certain illnesses like measles and diarrhea, dietary restriction is practiced. This can aggravate malnutrition in young children.


## What are the effects of washing and cutting?



* Certain precautions need to be taken while washing and cutting to minimize the loss of nutrients. 
* Repeated washing of food grains like rice and pulses results in losses of certain minerals and vitamins. 
* Vegetables and fruits should be washed thoroughly with potable water before cutting. 
* Cutting vegetables into small pieces exposes a greater surface area of the foodstuff to the atmosphere, resulting in loss of vitamins due to oxidation. Therefore, vegetables should be cut in to large pieces.
* Cut vegetables should not be soaked in water for long, as water-soluble minerals and vitamins get dissolved.


### Removal of pesticide residues


#### Washing



* The first step in the removal of pesticide residues from the food products is washing. \
* About 75-80% of pesticide residues are removed by cold water washing
* Washing with 2% of salt water will remove most of the contact pesticide residues that normally appear on the surface of the vegetables and fruits.
* The pesticide residues that are on the surface of the grapes, apples, guava, plums, mangoes, peaches, pears etc, vegetables like tomatoes, brinjal, okra require 2-3 washings.
* The green leafy vegetables must be washed with 2% salt water. 


#### Blanching 



* Blanching is a short treatment in hot water or steam applied to most of the vegetables. 
* But before blanching it is very important to thoroughly pre-wash the vegetables and fruits.


## What are the effects of cooking?



* Methods of cooking- boiling, steaming, pressure cooking, frying, roasting and baking. 
* Boiling is the most common method of cooking, during which heat-labile and water-soluble vitamins like vitamin B-complex and C are lost. 
* The practice of using excess water while cooking rice should be discouraged since it leads to loss of vitamins; just sufficient water to be fully absorbed should be used.
* Use of baking soda for hastening cooking of pulses should not be practiced, as it results in loss of vitamins.
* Frying involves cooking food in oil/ghee/vanaspati at high temperatures. Shallow frying involves use of much smaller amounts of oils than deep frying.
* Oils which have been repeatedly heated should not be mixed with fresh oil but should be used for process such as seasoning.


## Microwave Cooking 



* Microwave cooking is convenient, fast and preserves nutrients and also useful in reheating of food. 
* But it can reheat or cook unevenly and leave some cold spots in the food by which harmful bacteria can enter into our body. 
* So it is discouraged to use large amounts or big pieces in the microwave oven otherwise mix the food in between for even heating or cooking.
* Never use partially heated food. 
* Don't cook frozen food in the microwave oven directly as it leaves some parts of the food partially cooked.
* Always use glass or pottery dishes and food grade microwave friendly plastic dishes and wrap to re-heat foods


# Water and Beverages



* A normal healthy person needs to drink about 8 glasses (2 litre) of water per day.
* If a water source is not safe for drinking, boiling it for 10-15 minutes is a satisfactory method of purification of the water. It kills all disease-causing organisms and also removes temporary hardness.
* However, boiling will not remove other chemical impurities. Tablets containing 0.5g of chlorine can disinfect 20 litres of water.


## Milk



* Milk is an excellent beverage for all age groups as it is a rich source of nutrients.
* It contains most of the nutrients necessary for growth and development. It is, therefore, specially useful or feeding infants, toddlers, growing children and expectant women and nursing mothers.
* Milk proteins possess high biological value which is almost equal to that of meat, eggs and other high-quality animal proteins
* Milk proteins are valuable supplements to most vegetarian diets.
* Milk is a rich source of bioavailable calcium which helps in the building up of strong bones. 
* Milk fat serves as a vehicle for important fat-soluble vitamins A, D and E. 
* For strict vegetarians, milk is the only source of vitamin B12. 


## Tea and Coffee



* They are known to relieve mental and muscular fatigue. 
* This characteristic stimulating effect is due to their caffeine content. 
* A cup (150 ml) of brewed coffee contains 80-120 mg of caffeine and instant coffee 50-65 mg, while tea contains 3065 mg of caffeine. 
* Prefer tea over coffee.


## Tender Coconut Water



* Tender coconut water is a nutritious beverage. It has a caloric value of 17.4 per 100 g
* The concentration of sugar steadily increases from 1.5% to about 5.5% in the early months of maturation and this slowly falls to about 2% at the stage of full maturity.
* Tender coconut water contains most of the minerals
* It is an oral rehydration medium and keeps the body cool.
