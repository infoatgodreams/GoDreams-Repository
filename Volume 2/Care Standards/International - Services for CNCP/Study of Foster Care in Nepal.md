* Families and children know that if they go to an institution children get many free service. So people take advantage of of this
* People involved in child protection should shift focus to how to avoid unnecessary family separation while promoting sustainable reintegration
* Child separation should be considered as last resort
* Decision making should involve both children and professional panel.
* In Nepal, non-state and state service providers have been historically driven by an issue based approach to child protection
* Analysis and programmes focussed on specific issues meaning that children were grouped according to their specific vulnerabilities, which were the heart of organizations programming (ie. hazardous labour, violence, street life, trafficking, armed conflict, sexual exploitation and conflict with law. 
* This approach has proven to have serious limitations as children with specific vulnerabilities might has a wider range of protection problems (ie street boy might face the same protection challenges as a girl survivor from trafficking)
* Foster care is time bound. In reality, it is a flexible care service that can be provided for a few days as an “emergency” solution in the short term and also in the long term until the child reaches adulthood
* Families with no previous ties with the children were more keen to foster for a long period of time, as long as support was provided by organizations. 
* When possible caregivers are given income or job opportunities to help look after children. 
* Currently assistance consists mainly of an educational kit (uniforms, bags, etc) and support with school fees.
* Massive lack of policy and guidelines under foster care systems. Foster parents are not really aware of what foster care means and they are not regularly vigilantly directed or followed up. 
* In order to successfully perform their mandate, social worders need further assistance and regular supwervision from counsellors and other staff members. 


# Alternatives to foster care

* Street children as well as children who have lived for quite some time in residential care might have a distorted concept of family, or none at all, due to their dysfunctional family background or to the fact that they were abandoned and never had a chance to grow up in a family. 
* This shows how foster care might not always be the best immediate solution for children who for instance have bad memories relating to personal family history and are resistant to the care offered by other families; and/or needs to adapt from a large-scale residential care to a family like care environment before being placed in foster care.


## Children’s villages

* Children brought up in villages of 10-20 houses
* Villages are equipped with services such as medical post, schools and training centers
* Each house hosts max 10 children supervised by a single caregiver aka housemother. 
* House mothers:
    * Criteria: single mother/widow/separated, between 25-40 years and without children
    * They can work till 60 years
    * Free lodging and monthly allowance
* Children in villages have less exposure to outside world. They find themselves growing up in isolated reality.
