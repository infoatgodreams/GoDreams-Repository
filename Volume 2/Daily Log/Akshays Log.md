- United Nations International Children Education Fund study during 2005â€“2013 reported that CSA in Indian girls was 42%.[[8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8445113/#ref8)] A Government of India, Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) study in 2007 which interviewed 125,000 children in 13 Indian states revealed that the prevalence of all forms of child abuse is extremely high (physical abuse [66%], sexual abuse [50%], and emotional abuse [50%]). This major state-sponsored survey in India reported the prevalence of CSA as 53%.[[9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8445113/#ref9)] 
- Boys were equally affected and more than 20% were subjected to severe forms of sexual abuse that included: sexual assault, making the child fondle private parts, making the child exhibit private body parts, and being photographed in the nude.
**- Consistently, in other studies[[23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8445113/#ref23)] the highest numbers of registered cases were falling in this age group where teenagers (16 to less than 18 years old) were engaging in consensual relationships (sexual intercourse by mutual consent).**.
**- The MTP Act, 2003 makes it mandatory for healthcare professionals to keep all information on those seeking abortions confidential. According to POSCO Act, if a girl wants to undergo MTP on humanitarian grounds but does not want to file a police complaint (when pregnancy is an outcome of sexual assault), the healthcare professional must inform the police that the cause for pregnancy was rape. Healthcare professional's attempts to interact and work with young people will be severely compromised by a violation of privacy if they are legally obligated to reveal any knowledge of consensual, although underage sex.**

Paper: Supporting youth Leaving Care: A Study of Aftercare Practices
1. 44% of care leavers never were consulted with their post-CCI or rehab plan 
2. 20% of CLs did not even have a bank account 
3. National Health Protection Scheme and Ayushman Bharat for healthcare leave out CLs because they only look at family income levels 
4. JJ Act Mandates that an Individual Care Plan be created-how cool? 
5. Only CCIs registered under JJ get aftercare benefits 
6.  Interestingly, they set out to do a comparison between the kids who received aftercare support and kids who didnt, but they literally couldnt even find these kids.

- Only 45% of CCIs receive any sort of support from the government. 

- Deinstitutionalization driven bytargets or ideology can lead toadverse consequences: Over the lasttwo years, we have seen large scaledeinstitutionalisation taking placeand many CCIs closing down. This isevident from a comparison of datafrom the MWCD 2019 (9589 CCIs, 3.7lakh children) and NCPCR 2020 (7163CCIs, 2.5 lakh children) reports. (Page 19)
- - Visits are much more eff ective in terms of promoting sustained improvement in the conditions and treatmentof children if they take place regularly and systematically. If visits to the institutions by external commissions arecarried out only sporadically, they may do more harm than good. Especially with regard to cases of violence andabuse, visits might create expectations of justice among the children, which are often not fulfi lled; they mightgenerate more violence and abuse in a circle of punishment for spies and reward for silent spectators; and, in asystem prone to corruption, external commissions might even be monitored by some lobbies.39 (Page 28)
