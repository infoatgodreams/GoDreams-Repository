4.  If images have been screenshotted, place them in a sub-folder along with the PDF. Name the subfolder after the PDF. Note the links. 
    
5.  You can export your highlights into text to include in the notes using: [sumnotes](https://www.sumnotes.net/auth/login/?sign_in=1) or [Foxit PDF Reader](https://www.foxit.com/pdf-reader/). If you would like to extract more than 50 highlights from sumnotes, you can contact Navneeth or Akshay who can do it for you, we have the pro version.

## Content Rules

1.  Keep things factual. Direct quotes from the text can be used as far as possible, with minor sentence structure changes for readability 
    
2.  Reorder the notes topic/keyword wise, do not stick to the structure of the paper
    
3.  Couple of examples of notes: [Irvington House - Growth Potential of Pre-school aged Children in Institutional Care (navneethatgodreams.github.io)](https://navneethatgodreams.github.io/CAP/Volume-1/Reference-Reading/CCIs/Intl/Irvington-HouseGrowth-Potential-of-Pre-school-aged-children-in-institutional-care/)
    
4.  Use the secondary research section here to decide what to capture: 
    

[CAP Design Framework (navneethatgodreams.github.io)](https://navneethatgodreams.github.io/CAP/Volume-1/Program-Design/CAP-Design-Framework/)

-   If exporting is not possible, type in your notes
    
-   Make sure the notes are factual. If inferencing or writing an opinion, precede the paragraph with #opinion

-   You can copy/quote highlights from pdfs using quotation marks in your notes and/or mention the page number
    
-   If importing pictures/screenshots - give a caption
    
-   At the end of your note taking, rearrange your notes under headings putting similar topics/categories/domains together
    
-   Keep notes on documents factual, mention #opinion next to or above opinions/non factual inferences
    
-   Mention further readings that come out from the document under #readinglist
