-   Children’s Homes:
    

-   Lack of intellectual capital (1st principles of child care)
    
-   Lack of money (financial capital)
    

-   Funding based on no. of children vs quality of care - which keeps discussions at basic inputs level vs growth or quality level. 
    

-   Lack of talent (people) -> not a professional discipline and hence no hiring pipeline. 
    
-   Hostile, disconnected, regulatory policy environment
    
-   Apathy & neglect from society & media 
    
-   Isolated / operate in silos
    
-   Personal, value based approach of leadership
    
-   Operates in a high risk environment with regular scrutiny / suspicion from others. 
    

  
  

-   Government:
    

-   Lack of execution capacity 
    
-   Lack of data lending to prescriptive policy 
    
-   Electorally insignificant constituency (no political advantage)
    
-   Long term nature of outcomes not aligned with election cycles
    

  

-   Funders:
    

-   Lack of impact measurement tools as outcomes are too long term and complex to track
    
-   Lack of credible at-scale operators
    
-   Comparatively high risk to goodwill and reputation in case of mishaps
    
-   A nascent uncrowded sector with high potential to establish legacy and thought leadership.
    

  

-   Community / the Public / larger Society
    

-   Misconceptions / flawed understanding of the sector
    
-   Generally suspicious of children’s homes due to sensationalized stories in the media
    
-   Understanding is limited to what is shown in movies and the media (sensationalised depiction of ground reality).
    
-   Wish to contribute but do not know how to be effective.
    
-   Brings input focused, charity mindset to the sector through ad hoc interactions, inadequate focus / recognition.
    
-   Does not think about the problem much -- general neglect and apathy.
