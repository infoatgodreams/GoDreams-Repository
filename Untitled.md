_Source: [Budget for Children 2022-23 Analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dLv6dVrUjUXisEWIHisCS4MHficDf4yz/view?usp=sharing) by HAQ: Centre for Child Rights_


## Key Highlights



* Budget for Children (BfC) share is the lowest share in the last 11 years  i.e** 2.35% vs 2.46% last year. **
* In absolute terms, the allocation is** INR 92,736 Crore** (Union Budget 2022-23) against** INR 85,712.56 Crore** (Union Budget 2021-22). Although this is an 8.19% increase in absolute terms, the increase is not proportionate to the increase in the Union Budget which is an overall increase of 13.25%
* The share of Budget for Children (BfC) is 2.35% of the Union Budget 2022-23, a fall of **0.11% points** from the share of the previous year.
* In terms of the sectoral share, **Child Health, Education and Development **continues to receive reduced allocation in the Union Budget 2022-23 while  the share of **Child Protection **has seen a marginal increase of **0.01 %** (i.e 0.04% vs 0.03% last year)

* Children protection has been **one of the least prioritized sectors** in terms of resource allocation over the years. 
* In 2022-23, child protection has received **only 0.04 per cent** of the total Union Budget 
* In absolute terms this is** INR 1,583.82 Crores** which is a 44.7% increase but in the context of the rising child protection needs due to the pandemic, this is insufficient.
* In order to understand the** inadequateness of child protection allocations**, it will be pertinent to take a look at the allocations towards some of the flagship schemes in the previous years’ budget. For example, in the 2019-20 Union Budget, the total allocation for the Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS) was **INR 1500 Crore. **As we moved ahead, the total allocation for the overall child protection sector is a little more than INR 1500 Crore. The question that arises at this point is if the allocation made in the Union Budget 2022- 23 is sufficient to meet the growing needs of the child protection sector. 
* The ChildLine India Foundation reported an **increase in child marriages** by more than 33% and August alone an increase of more than 88%.  	 				
* Reports from other states such as Jharkhand suggest that the **number of children trafficked increased by over 600 %** in April and May, 2020 during the Covid-19 lockdown, when compared to the same two months in 2019. 
* **Kidnapping and Abduction** of children has the highest number of cases - **54,785** cases.
* It is now an admitted fact that **child labour has seen an upward trend** during the COVID times as there are enough evidences to show that many children had to drop out from school to support their families. The ILO and UNICEF report warns that globally, **9 million additional children are at risk** of being pushed into child labour by the end of 2022 as a result of the pandemic. A simulation model shows **this number could rise to 46 million** if they don’t have access to critical social protection coverage.
* According to UNICEF India, more than **1.5 billion children in India missed out their schooling** due to COVID-19 restrictions. This has compelled children to work to support their families. And yet there is a **massive reduction of 75 per cent **towards the** National Child Labour Programme** in the Union Budget 2022-23, which cannot be justified.
