# Introduction

Children in CCIs frequently are exposed to traumatic events pre-admission to CCIs and require specialized counselling, which is rarely available.  In addition to this, the structured group environment of the home & high child:caregiver ratios lead to very limited personlized attention for each child.  Children are also exposed to violence, bullying etc. at the CCI and school. According to one study, 56% of children in institutional care in 13 Indian states reported having experiences physical abuse at the institution. 


Young adults often lack familial support systems, and typically have to independently deal with long term mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, adhd & suicidal ideation. Insitutionalization has been linked to poorer adult outcomes, particularly cognitive and emotional developmental issues such as lower IQ, poor attachment patterns, behavioral issues and distrust of others.

- Young adults do not get involved in substance abuse and unsafe/criminal activities. 


## Indicative Outputs
