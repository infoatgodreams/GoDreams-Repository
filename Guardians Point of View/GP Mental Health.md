# Introduction

Children in CCIs frequently are exposed to traumatic events pre-admission to CCIs and require specialized counselling, which is rarely available.  In addition to this, the structured group environment of the home & high child:caregiver ratios lead to very limited personlized attention for each child.  Young adults often lack familial support systems, and typically have to deal with long term mental health issues independently.
