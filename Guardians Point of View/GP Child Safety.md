# Introduction

Ensuring that children are and feel safe in the CCI environment emerges as a crucial factor in achieving positive adult outcomes. Studies show that most children in CCIs have had one or more traumatic events in their past, and that children in CCIs are in danger of being physically, emotionally or sexually abused at some point in their childhood. 

# The Gold Standard in Child Safety

## Target Outcomes 

 - Young adults are self confident, know what to do in situations that put themselves or others around them in danger, aware of forms of abuse and protections available to them and confident to voice out concerns and seek resolution from competent forums.


# Indicative Outputs

 - Children are not afraid to voice out concerns and highlight red flags if any, as well as work with CCI management to solve them. 
 - Children participate in the decision making at CCIs and have minimal behavioral issues
 - Children have reducing or no clinical indicators of Physical abuse, sexual abuse or emotional abuse. 
 - Children articulate a feeling of safety, their voice being heard,
