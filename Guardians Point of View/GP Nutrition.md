# Introduction

Nutrition is one of the domains where the science is clear on straightforward inputs required for children achieve positive outcomes.  The quantity of macro and micro nutrients required for children across age groups is publicly available, and local nutritionists can use this to come up with diet plans based on regional preferences.


# Inputs

The availability of the science and the current reality of nutrition in CCIs implies that the **emphasis of this domain be on building and sustaining:** 

## Adequate Nutritional Inputs
- Frequent monitoring of nutritional inputs and outputs through metrics such as macro-nutrient/micro nutrient composition of diet, height vs age, weight vs age, medical reports
- Diets balanced and efficient to deliver nutritional inputs on par with global standards. 

## Effective Nutrition Processes
- Standardization of menus and grocery purchasing cycles
- Individualization of nutritional needs and tastes
- Operationalizing hygiene, food safety and sanitization routines
- Food emergency plans
- Infrastructure to facilitate efficient cooking, such as large vessels and adequate storage space

## Integration of care practices around food
- Reimagined mealtime experiences so that children are supported by caregivers to develop positive attitudes toward food
- Quick identification through observation & measurement, of malnourishment, stunting, wasting and underweight. 
- Quick identification through observation & testing, of eating disorders, allergies and medical issues
- Response guidelines for children identified as below age benchmarks including menu upgrades, special diets and expert consultations

## Facilitating child's development around food
- Children self regulate quantity of food and see the impact of feedback provided on food quality/diversity
- Children exposed to diverse types of foods and cuisines 
- Children taught about  the food cycle from purchase to waste disposal
- Children taught to self identify and communicate symptoms of malnourishment and other deficiencies

## Information availability around food
- Allied areas such as healthcare and caregiving must have data on children's nutritional status and history via individual care plans. 
- Recommendations from these areas must have a quick turn around into nutritional inputs. 

To bridge this gap, **challenges and opportunities that exist** are: 

``` ## Cultural influence on food 
- Gender disparity in food - differences in expectations for quantity and quality of food, differences in participation in food preparation etc.
- Regional, cultural and religious influences on menu - differences in type of food available to children, diversity of diet and quantity.
- Traditional food preparation - differences in techniques used in the kitchen
```
## Dominance of Input focused incentives

- Donor behavior influencing diet - celebrations, special events, in-kind donation of food have a disproportionate influence on diet choices
- Children looking malnourished could have a benefit to maintaining "orphanage" image in some cases
- Mindset of meeting basic survival vs excellent nutritional inputs
- Quality and type of food provided varying based on donation sources, regularity and market prices vs solely dependent on nutritional needs.


# The Gold Standard in Nutrition

## Outputs

 - Zero stunting and under-weight children at the CCI (Measured)
 - Children are able to self regulate quantity of food consumed (Observed)
 - Children enjoy a wide variety of food (self reported, staff reported)
 - Children are have sufficient energy levels through the day (self reported, staff reported, school reported)
 - Children have no recuring medical issues curable through special diets (staff reported, doctor reported)
 -
