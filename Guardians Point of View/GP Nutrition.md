# Introduction

Nutrition is one of the domains where the science is clear on straightforward inputs required for children achieve positive outcomes.  The quantity of macro and micro nutrients required for children across age groups is publicly available, and local nutritionists can use this to come up with diet plans based on regional preferences.

This implies that the emphasis of this domain be on building and sustaining: 

## Effective Nutrition Processes
- Standardization of menus and grocery purchasing cycles
- Individualization of nutritional needs and tastes
- Operationalizing hygiene, food safety and sanitization routines
- Food emergency plans
- Infrastructure to facilitate efficient cooking, such as large vessels and adequate storage space

## Integration of care practices around food
- Reimagined mealtimes so that children are supported by caregivers to develop positive attitudes toward food
- Quick identification through observation & measurement, of malnourishment, stunting, wasting and underweight. 
- Quick identification through observation & testing, of eating disorders, allergies and medical issues
- Response guidelines for children identified as below age benchmarks including menu upgrades, special diets and expert consultations

## The child's development around food
- Children self regulate quantity of food and provide and see implemented feedback on food quality
- Children exposed to diverse types of foods and cuisines 
- Children taught about  the food cycle from purchase to waste disposal
- Children taught to self identify and communicate symptoms of malnourishment and other deficiencies

## Information availability around food
- Allied areas such as healthcare and caregiving must have data on children's nutritional status and history via individual care plans. 

To bridge this gap, *challenges that need to be overcome* are: 

## Beliefs and culture around food 
- Gender disparity in food - differences in expectations for quantity and quality of food, differences in participation in food preparation etc.
- Regional cultural  and religious influences on menu - differences in type of food available to children
-
