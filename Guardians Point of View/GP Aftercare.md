# Introduction
Aftercare refers to providing support, financially, or otherwise, to persons, who have completed 18 years of age but not completed 21 years, and have left any institutional care to join mainstream society. According to a multinational comparison of caregivers, the findings suggest that **employment** is the main challenge for care-leavers. Not far behind, **education, housing and poverty** were perceived as main challenges, followed by **mental health and delinquency**

In fact, the availability of appropriate aftercare services for careleavers has a dramatic impact on whether young people thrive or falter.
