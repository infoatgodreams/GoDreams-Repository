# Introduction
Aftercare refers to providing support, financially, or otherwise, to persons, who have completed 18 years of age but not completed 21 years, and have left any institutional care to join mainstream society. According to a multinational comparison of caregivers, the findings suggest that **employment** is the main challenge for care-leavers. Not far behind, **education, housing and poverty** were perceived as main challenges, followed by **mental health and delinquency**

In fact, the availability of appropriate aftercare services for careleavers has a dramatic impact on whether young people thrive or falter. 

# The Gold Standard in Aftercare 

## Target Outcomes 
- Careleavers are able to smoothly transition from childhood to adulthood by participation in the community life

- Careleavers have essential life skills for self - esteem, including emotional intelligence, communication skills and relationship skills
- Careleavers are able to live independently, knowing their citizenship rights and responsibilities such as financial literacy, identity documents, etc.

## Indicative Outputs
- In preparation for transition, each child has a strong Individual Care Plan (ICP) as a tool for planning for the overall development of the child, with close and activie participation from the careleaver
- Careleavers are supported to continue higher-education or specialised vocational training programs until they are employed
- Careleavers are shown to be confident about being able to live independently with/without state support, through regular assessments 
- Careleavers are able to create healthy interpersonal relationships and access mental health services to support stable emotional well-being
