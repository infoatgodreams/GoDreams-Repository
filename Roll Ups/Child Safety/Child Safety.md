## CAREGIVING REQUIREMENTS FOR CHILD SAFETY

### Who are the caregivers?
- A trained social worker must be appointed

### Code of Conduct

DOs • Be visible and not in a secluded place while in contact with children at the work place • Protect the child by not disclosing the identity of the child outside the team • Uphold the privacy of the child by not disclosing the identity of the child to the media • Ensure that there are staff members of the same gender when escorting the child between locations and also when taking care of the child/children at any location

-   All relatives/guardians need to sign a register before taking the child out
    
-   A female caregiver always accompanies the children on the bus
    
-   All visitors must be accompanied by staff, security guard mandatory, visitors given passes
    
-   One manager in the home at all times, day and night
    

DONTs • Do not sleep alone with any child • Do not stay back at the child care institution/orphanage or interact with children after dark/ 19:00 hours • Do not do things for children of a personal nature that they can do themselves, such as use the toilet, bathe or change clothes (unless the child is severely ill or injured - in such case, another staff / caretaker should also be present) • Do not give gifts directly to children • Do not share any sensitive and confidential personal & family information shared by the child with CCI staff & management without taking the child’s permission

-   Two training sessions conducted with all staff, parents and local police
    
-   Half day refresher training once a year for all staff
    

## WORKING WITH CHILDREN

-   Effective caregiving is a combination of setting boundaries and structures and providing autonomy.
    

-   Children may not conform to all the rules and the staff can decide what are acceptable.
    
-   Extreme disciplining may lead to defiance in children.
    
-   Encourage children to ask questions about rules and have a discussion with them on why certain rules are important. By teaching children to be blindly compliant, we are discouraging critical thinking, which is a valuable characteristic. This not only hampers critical thinking but teaches them that adults are always right which is untrue.
    
-   While working with adolescents recognize that they are developing ideas that might differ from your own. Unless these ideas place the adolescent in danger of harm to self or others, accept their beliefs as an example of their developing individuality.
    
-   Don’t deny children participation in activities, events they were looking forward to attend as a punishment for breaking rules unless the same was announced beforehand.
    

### DEALING WITH EMOTIONS & ATTACHMENT

-   The best way to work with children is to be empathetic towards them.
    
-   Children can quickly understand who understands them and who cannot understand them. When a child has a fight and is angry with everyone, caregiver could go near and ask permission to sit nearby. The caregiver could say that “I can understand that you are angry and do you want to talk about it?”
    
-   As an adult living with children, express your emotions on the child’s behavior. Only being patient is not the way to deal with children experiencing emotional and behavioral challenges.
    
-   Having conversations about others feelings is required too as it helps the child build skills for empathy and considering different perspectives. Let them know that the staff is human too and not just an authoritarian figure.
    
-   Use the language of “anger expression” (appropriate and inappropriate) instead of anger management or “controlling anger”. Do not seek tips for “controlling” child’s anger.
    
-   Anger may have been a useful emotion for children who were abused as that emotion made them protect themselves and realize that they don’t feel safe.
    
-   When children are distressed or aggressive, help them to calm down and then try to have a conversation.When children are triggered (having a strong emotional and physical reaction) they do not have access to the part of the brain that helps them think rationally.
    
-   Therefore, it is important and will be more effective if caregivers help the child stabilize emotionally by using a range of tools such as grounding or relaxation exercises before disciplining, discussing behavior corrective measures. After the child has calmed down, the staff/parent should have a conversation with the child about what made him/her angry. It is not helpful if you ask children not to be angry. Anger is an emotion and an adult can teach the child to express it healthily. Address the anger and tell the child to express it in words.
    
-   If the child does not have a dialogue about the anger, it will lead to bottling up of the anger and resentment towards the adult causing defiance to follow anything that is told to the child.
    
-   When a staff realizes that the child is going to be aggressive and say bad things about the staff’s character, the staff can tell her/him to think about what s/he actually feels and write it down in a letter rather than trying to hurt the staff by saying nasty things. It may help to acknowledge the impact the child’s words are having in a manner that does not place the responsibility on the child, for example, “I can see that you are angry and hurting. The words that you are saying are hurting me and making me angry/frustrated as well. I don’t think we can have a helpful conversation when we are both so upset.”
    
-   Teach the child the difference between response and reaction.
    
-   Sexual abuse in the past may cause sexual dysfunction or excessive sexual acting out. Let the child seek help from a counselor in such cases. Finding the child while engaging in sexually reactive behavior should not be used as a reason for punishment or scolding.
    
-   Encourage parent(s)/guardian(s)to meet the children as much as they can. it helps the child to build trust and reduces the attachment issues they face which reflect on their behavior.
    
-   In early childhood it also helps in the brain development of the child. Model empathy and compassion in your engagements with children and recognize and encourage empathy and acts of kindness among children that will make them live together in harmony.
    
-   It is normal for children especially in the adolescent age group to explore their sexuality. The caregivers need to accept and deal with dignity when a child identifies himself/ herself/themselves as gay, lesbian, bisexual or other sexual orientation.

-   Brief the child to follow the route discussed with the Naunihal staff. The child should make use of the usual path. The child should be informed to take a busy and well-lit road, and the dangers of taking short-cuts and unknown routes should be discussed with the child.
    
-   Prepare the child to be attentive to her surroundings, her belongings and the people around her
    
-   Inform the child that she must run away raise an alarm and seek help. She should not refrain from asking for help if there is a feeling of being in trouble or danger.
    

-   Explain to the child that if someone makes an attempt to grab her purse or bag, then at that moment, it is advisable to let it go.
    

-   Fighting in order to resist it could result in the risk of getting hurt. Money and other possessions likely to be lost in such situations can be later recovered or replaced. The harm caused to the child may be irreversible.
    

-   Under any circumstances, no form of sexual maltreatment is ever alright. Have regular conversations with children with regard to personal safety

-   Instruct the child to cross the street if she feels like she is being followed, and notice if the person following her does the same. If this happens, the child should start running immediately. Develop an understanding in the child that there is no harm in running, and there is no need to wait till theperson is very close to take action
    
-   Explain to the child that while getting into a taxi, she should ensure that the child lock of the doors isn’t activated

## Stranger Danger

Discuss with the child the benefit of yelling when in trouble, as it is a discuss with the child the benefit of yelling as a good way to seek attention from passers-by - Cultivate an understanding in the child that it is unsafe to leave food and drinks unattended at any point. The child should not accept anything to eat or drink from a stranger. - Discuss with children how consuming unattended/already opened food and beverages is harmful as the food or drink can be spiked with drugs causing intoxication, etc. - The child should be made aware that if anyone hastens the child to immediately leave with him or her on the grounds of a disaster like fire, earthquake, etc. she should not leave with the said person – but call Naunihalimmediately and take their advice - Inform the child that she should not trust a stranger who follows her around and won’t leave her alone sometimes despite telling him to. This also amounts to stalking.

-   Initiate a discussion with the child on the importance of trusting an individualafter obtaining information about the person and the situation. The child must understand that not all strangers are rude or forceful right away. It is important to be aware of strangers, both men and women, who seem nice — the ones whomake conversation easily and get important information without the person realizing it
    
-   Educate the child that she is not obligated to share any personal information withany person. If a stranger or a nominally familiar person discloses his or her personal information, it doesn’t mean the child is obligated to share similar information about herself with him/her.
    
-   Discuss with the child about consent. Inform her that there is nothing wrong with sounding ‘rude’ and saying NO if the person continues to pressurize or botherher. Saying NO is the child’s right, and it is a complete sentence without requiring any further elaboration or justification.

## RESPONDING TO A CHILD PERPETRATOR

[^8]

-   Sexual abuse in the past may cause sexual dysfunction or excessive sexual acting out. Let the child seek help from a counselor in such cases. Finding the child while engaging in sexually reactive behavior should not be used as a reason for punishment or scolding.
    
-   Whenever a child is seen engaging in unacceptable behavior or is found doing something that is unacceptable, the child should be first asked what he/she was up to. Listen to children. After knowing what the child was doing, an adult can explain why a behavior is inappropriate.
    

-   In order to avoid shaming, embarrassing or humiliating the child, the caregivers should hold this conversation one- on-one with the child and avoid confronting the child in front of the other children.
    
-   Talk about inappropriate behavior without demeaning their self worth or attacking their personality or character.
    
-   When correcting behavior, provide a calm explanation for your preferences. Giving a reason helps children understand the implications of their behavior for others
    
-   Do not verbally or physically abuse children. This hurts them and teaches them that abuse is a problem-solving technique, which they are bound to use to solve their own problems.
    
-   Take abuse between children seriously as well and teach them alternate ways to solve problems.
    
-   Avoid impatient body language like eye rolling, foot tapping or sighing. This can discourage a child from talking.
    
-   Hold conversations at the appropriate time and place. It is also important to address an issue in a timely manner. If one waits too long to address a situation, sometimes the child will not remember the incident or more often than not, it will not register that they did something wrong or unacceptable, thereby causing them to repeat the behavior.
    
-   Refrain from labeling children negatively (for eg: manda, aalsi, moti, sukdi, bewakoof). All labels related to looks, intellect and behavior should be avoided.
    
-   If you see a child lying, you can talk about the situation and address the lying instead of labeling the child as “liar” r “chor/stealer”
    
-   In severe cases of physical or sexual abuse the PO could also conduct group sessions with the perpetrators on relevant themes.

# CURRENT REALITIES OF CHILD SAFETY
- Fisher et al. (1997) have pointed  out that most of the characteristic early problems of children adopted from orphanages  might indicate brain damage or emotionally produced pathology if they were found in children reared in families.[^3]
- In the U.K. sample  children’s scores on disinhibited attachment disturbance were positively correlated with  their scores on hyperactivity and disruptive behavior measures at age 4 and hyperactivity, disruptive behavior and emotional difficulties measures at 6 years.[^3]

## RESPONDING TO A CHILD PERPETRATOR
- According to a manual titles "working with children sensitively" by Prerana, [^8]
	- Sexual abuse in the past may cause sexual dysfunction or excessive sexual acting out. Let the child seek help from a counselor in such cases. Finding the child while engaging in sexually reactive behavior should not be used as a reason for punishment or scolding.
	- Whenever a child is seen engaging in unacceptable behavior or is found doing something that is unacceptable, the child should be first asked what he/she was up to. Listen to children. After knowing what the child was doing, an adult can explain why a behavior is inappropriate.
	* In order to avoid shaming, embarrassing or humiliating the child, the caregivers should hold this conversation one- on-one with the child and avoid confronting the child in front of the other children.
	* Talk about inappropriate behavior without demeaning their self worth or attacking their personality or character.
	* When correcting behavior, provide a calm explanation for your preferences. Giving a reason helps children understand the implications of their behavior for others
	* Do not verbally or physically abuse children. This hurts them and teaches them that abuse is a problem-solving technique, which they are bound to use to solve their own problems.
	* Take abuse between children seriously as well and teach them alternate ways to solve problems.
	* Avoid impatient body language like eye rolling, foot tapping or sighing. This can discourage a child from talking.
	* Hold conversations at the appropriate time and place. It is also important to address an issue in a timely manner. If one waits too long to address a situation, sometimes the child will not remember the incident or more often than not, it will not register that they did something wrong or unacceptable, thereby causing them to repeat the behavior.
	* Refrain from labeling children negatively (for eg: manda, aalsi, moti, sukdi, bewakoof). All labels related to looks, intellect and behavior should be avoided.
	* If you see a child lying, you can talk about the situation and address the lying instead of labeling the child as “liar” r “chor/stealer”
	* In severe cases of physical or sexual abuse the PO could also conduct group sessions with the perpetrators on relevant themes.

# Caregiving 
### Who are the caregivers? 

• A trained social worker must be appointed

• 1 Tutor/ Teacher appointed for every 25 children
• Same gender employees with same gender children, however, women staff can be taken in at boy’s home
• NO male staff in girl’s home
• The provision for security to guard the place, should be as per the ICPS standards

### Code of Conduct
**DOs**
• Be visible and not in a secluded place while in contact with children at the work place
• Protect the child by not disclosing the identity of the child outside the team
• Uphold the privacy of the child by not disclosing the identity of the child to the media
• Ensure that there are staff members of the same gender when escorting the child between locations and also when taking care of the child/children at any location
- All relatives/guardians need to sign a register before taking the child out
- A female caregiver always accompanies the children on the bus 
- All visitors must be accompanied by staff, security guard mandatory, visitors given passes
- One manager in the home at all times, day and night

• Do not share any sensitive and confidential personal & family information shared by the child with CCI staff & management without taking the child’s permission
- Do not send child home if there’s a history of abuse or if the child is scared
- Do not allow Male visitors after 7 pm

### Caregiver training
- For Rainbow's caregivers [^6]
	- Full day orientation about the policy is mandatory 
	- Gender and sexuality training recommended 
	- All  donors and visitors need to be trained and informed of comms and behaviour protocol 
	- Orient and train bus drivers on child protection concepts and the severity of punishment 
	- Code of conduct needs to be signed by all stakeholders within 7 days of their engagement 
	- Two training sessions conducted with all staff, parents and local police 
	- Half day refresher training once a year for all staff
	- #### WORKING WITH CHILDREN
		-  Effective caregiving is a combination of setting boundaries and structures and providing autonomy.
		* Children may not conform to all the rules and the staff can decide what are acceptable.
		* Extreme disciplining may lead to defiance in children.
		* Encourage children to ask questions about rules and have a discussion with them on why certain rules are important. By teaching children to be blindly compliant, we are discouraging critical thinking, which is a valuable characteristic. This not only hampers critical thinking but teaches them that adults are always right which is untrue.
		* While working with adolescents recognize that they are developing ideas that might differ from your own. Unless these ideas place the adolescent in danger of harm to self or others, accept their beliefs as an example of their developing individuality.
		* Don’t deny children participation in activities, events they were looking forward to attend as a punishment for breaking rules unless the same was announced beforehand.
	- #### DEALING WITH EMOTIONS & ATTACHMENT
		*  The best way to work with children is to be empathetic towards them.
		*  Children can quickly understand who understands them and who cannot understand them. When a child has a fight and is angry with everyone, caregiver could go near and ask permission to sit nearby. The caregiver could say that “I can understand that you are angry and do you want to talk about it?”
		* As an adult living with children, express your emotions on the child’s behavior. Only being patient is not the way to deal with children experiencing emotional and behavioral challenges.
		* Having conversations about others feelings is required too as it helps the child build skills for empathy and considering different perspectives. Let them know that the staff is human too and not just an authoritarian figure.
		* Use the language of “anger expression” (appropriate and inappropriate) instead of anger management or “controlling anger”. Do not seek tips for “controlling” child’s anger.
		* Anger may have been a useful emotion for children who were abused as that emotion made them protect themselves and realize that they don’t feel safe.
		* When children are distressed or aggressive, help them to calm down and then try to have a conversation.When children are triggered (having a strong emotional and physical reaction) they do not have access to the part of the brain that helps them think rationally.
		* Therefore, it is important and will be more effective if caregivers help the child stabilize emotionally by using a range of tools such as grounding or relaxation exercises before disciplining, discussing behavior corrective measures. After the child has calmed down, the staff/parent should have a conversation with the child about what made him/her angry. It is not helpful if you ask children not to be angry. Anger is an emotion and an adult can teach the child to express it healthily. Address the anger and tell the child to express it in words.
		* If the child does not have a dialogue about the anger, it will lead to bottling up of the anger and resentment towards the adult causing defiance to follow anything that is told to the child.
		* When a staff realizes that the child is going to be aggressive and say bad things about the staff’s character, the staff can tell her/him to think about what s/he actually feels and write it down in a letter rather than trying to hurt the staff by saying nasty things. It may help to acknowledge the impact the child’s words are having in a manner that does not place the responsibility on the child, for example, “I can see that you are angry and hurting. The words that you are saying are hurting me and making me angry/frustrated as well. I don’t think we can have a helpful conversation when we are both so upset.”
		* Teach the child the difference between response and reaction.
		* Sexual abuse in the past may cause sexual dysfunction or excessive sexual acting out. Let the child seek help from a counselor in such cases. Finding the child while engaging in sexually reactive behavior should not be used as a reason for punishment or scolding.
		*  Encourage parent(s)/guardian(s)to meet the children as much as they can. it helps the child to build trust and reduces the attachment issues they face which reflect on their behavior.
		* In early childhood it also helps in the brain development of the child. Model empathy and compassion in your engagements with children and recognize and encourage empathy and acts of kindness among children that will make them live together in harmony.
		* It is normal for children especially in the adolescent age group to explore their sexuality. The caregivers need to accept and deal with dignity when a child identifies himself/ herself/themselves as gay, lesbian, bisexual or other sexual orientation.

- While using facilities in public spaces like bathrooms, etc. – the child should avoid common facilities and use those reserved for females only. The concept of reservation for her safety and convenience should be discussed with the child.
- Educate the child about road traffic safety. The child should follow the traffic rules and road safety regulations. She should check the traffic signals before crossing the street, look out for any approaching vehicles, and use the zebra crossing wherever available.
- Brief the child to follow the route discussed with the Naunihal staff. The child should make use of the usual path. The child should be informed to take a busy and well-lit road, and the dangers of taking short-cuts and unknown routes should be discussed with the child.
- Prepare the child to be attentive to her surroundings, her belongings and the people around her
- Inform the child that she must run away raise an alarm and seek help. She should not refrain from asking for help if there is a feeling of being in trouble or danger.
	- Explain to the child that if someone makes an attempt to grab her purse or bag, then at that moment, it is advisable to let it go. 
		- Fighting in order to resist it could result in the risk of getting hurt. Money and other possessions likely to be lost in such situations can be later recovered or replaced. The harm caused to the child may be irreversible. 
	- Under any circumstances, no form of sexual maltreatment is ever alright. Have regular conversations with children with regard to personal safety
	- Discuss with the child that it is never her fault if any such situation arises
	- Inform the child that any incidents of being followed, being teased or troubled should be reported to Naunihal staff immediately, even if it is a hunch. 
	- Instruct the child to cross the street if she feels like she is being followed, and notice if the person following her does the same. If this happens, the child should start running immediately. Develop an understanding in the child that there is no harm in running, and there is no need to wait till theperson is very close to take action
	- Explain to the child that while getting into a taxi, she should ensure that the child lock of the doors isn’t activated
	- Discuss instances like maintaining distance from the car and never getting into the car — even if the stranger is going in the same direction that the child is headed, or the stranger says there is an emergency or a disaster along the way

	- Inform the child that she should not trust a stranger who follows her around and won’t leave her alone sometimes despite telling him to. This also amounts to stalking. 
 - Initiate a discussion with the child on the importance of trusting an individualafter obtaining information about the person and the situation. The child must understand that not all strangers are rude or forceful right away. It is important to be aware of strangers, both men and women, who seem nice — the ones whomake conversation easily and get important information without the person realizing it
 - Educate the child that she is not obligated to share any personal information withany person. If a stranger or a nominally familiar person discloses his or her personal information, it doesn’t mean the child is obligated to share similar information about herself with him/her.
 - Discuss with the child about consent. Inform her that there is nothing wrong with sounding ‘rude’ and saying NO if the person continues to pressurize or botherher. Saying NO is the child’s right, and it is a complete sentence without requiring any further elaboration or justification.

# NOT IN THE FIRST DRAFT OF THE ROLL-UP

# Measurement tools: [Assessment Tools](Roll%20Ups/Assessment%20Tools.md)
- 
- Socio-Demographic Performa was constructed for the study consisting of 2 major sections. First, was the personal history regarding a child’s age, gender, **socio-economic status (SES),** and school history. [[Kuppuswamy scale]] was used for SES assessment (Tabassum and Rao, 2017).
	- The second section on **family history** included information on the age, education, and income of parents or head of the family, family history of psychiatric or physical illness, type of family, number of family members, living space, history of substance use, history of other forms of abuse, history of exposure to parental violence or any other significant life events.
		- [[Child PTSD Symptom Scale (CPSS)]] (Foa et al., 2001): CPSS assesses on a 4-point likert scale, the frequency of PTSD symptoms within the past month for a child who has experienced a traumatic event. The scale had satisfactory internal and test-retest reliability along with adequate convergent validity with other PTSD measures. WHO guideline for scale translation was followed to translate the scale into the Hindi language.
		- [[Children’s Impact of Events Scale –13 (CRIES-13)]] (Horowitz et al., 1979): It comprises of 13 items on 4 point likert scale to assesses PTSD symptoms in children between age range of 7–16 years. The scale has satisfactory internal consistency. WHO’s guidelines for scale translation were followed to translate the scale into the Hindi language.
		- [[Developmental Psychopathology Checklist (DPCL)]] (Kapur et al., 1995): DPCL is an Indian adapted version of the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) by Achenbach and Edelbrock, consisting of 6 subsections. In the present study, sub-scale psychopathology was only used.
		- [[Abuse Form]]: The first section included incident information on child’s age at the time of the abuse, frequency of abuse, time since the abuse, and type of abuse. Disclosure information was the second section which included details on time taken for disclosure, threat for disclosure, and sources of support after disclosure.
		- [[Children’s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS)]]: The CGAS is a clinician completed numeric scale ranging from lowest (1) to highest (100)functioning. It captures behavioural descriptors of functioning within the last month for children that is independent of specific mental health diagnosis.
