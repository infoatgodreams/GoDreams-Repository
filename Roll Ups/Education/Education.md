# Major challenges of learning for OVC (Orphans and Vulnerable Children)
- According to a report that looks at child performance in five different sites in developing countries[^1], The ill effects of being an orphaned or abandoned child (OAC) in a LMIC are reported to include fewer years of schooling, poorer school performance, poorer households, less adequate housing, increased malnutrition, higher morbidity and mortality, poorer access to medical care, and a higher prevalence of depression
