# Why is education important for OVC?(Orphans and Vulnerable children)

According to a paper on the educational support for OVC in South Africa[^5], 
* Education as recognised in the convention on the rights of the child is **a basic human right for all children** (Committee on the Rights of the Child, 1989). 
* A child who has access to quality primary schooling has a **better chance in life.** 
* A child who knows how to read and write and do basic arithmetic has a **solid foundation for continued learning** throughout life (USAID & CRS, 2008).
* They further observe that education benefits individuals and the whole nation as a major instrument for social and economic development (USAID & CRS, 2008)
* Hallfors et al (2011) pointed out that supporting adolescent girls to stay in school increases their chances of remaining in school, **hence reducing chances of contracting HIV through early marriage**. This intervention further reduces chances of girls dropping out of school
* Schools not only benefit the child but can serve as important resource centres to meet the broader needs of the community (PEPFAR, 2006). “Education is likely to lead to employability and can foster a child developing a sense of competence” (PEPFAR, 2006, p. 9). 
* USAID and CRS (2008) point out that basic education in primary and secondary levels contribute to the reduction of poverty. It increases labour productivity, improves health and enables people to participate fully in the economy and the development of their societies.
* Thus OVC **need educational interventions** as they are at risk of becoming infected with HIV due to economic hardships, reduced parental care and protection and increased susceptibility to abuse, and exploitation.

# Data relevant to education of OVC

## Data that captures the struggles of OVC in achieving educational outcomes
According to a paper on educational intervention planning for children in care[^14], 
- Youth that left long term foster care after age 17 have been disadvantaged fivefold; 
	- firstly because of their **higher risk of poor grades in primary school,** 
	- secondly because **they received lower grades than other children with the same cognitive capacity**, 
	- thirdly because they got a **lower education** than peers with similar cognitive capacity (results on males only in Vinnerljung et al., 2010), 
	- fourthly because they got **lower education than peers with the same average grades** from primary school; 
	- and fifthly because of their l**ower chance of achieving a secondary education when grades were poor**, e.g. through use of adult education opportunities.

According to a paper on the educational outcomes of children in care, 
- In the UK, it is evident that looked after children were being failed by the education system as far back as the 1980s. When data started to be collected, the clearest indicator of this was the number of children leaving care with no school qualifications of any kind (Jackson et al., 2005). 
* A 2008 literature review published in the USA found that children in OHC demonstrated several academic risks, which was partly caused by multiple disruptions in schooling due to changes in placements
* Research also indicates that children in care in Canada have poorer educational outcomes than their same age peers (Dill et al., 2012; Flynn et al., 2012)
* Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) data has long indicated that children in care have lower reading and numeracy test scores than their peers (AIHW, 2007; 2011). A 2007 study looked at 47 young people discharged from care in NSW in the 1990s. The study found that these young people were half more likely to have finished Year 12 than their peers in the general population. Almost 20% of the care leavers involved in the study had not completed Year 10 (Cashmore et al., 2007).
* An important finding is that some young people in OHC do have successful educational outcomes. They are the young people who are participating in or have completed a post-secondary qualification at university or other institution. 


## Comparison of educational outcomes for maltreated children in home vs care settings
*Maltreatment refers to the cruel and violent treatment of children*

According to a paper that compared outcomes of maltreated children in foster/home settings vs larger institutional care settings[^11].
- Some studies in the USA and Australia that compared children in care to other child welfare-involved children found no differences in academic performance after controlling for differences between the groups, although others found their educational performance was worse than that of the comparison group
- However, an American study that compared children in care to others in the community, including maltreated children not in care, reported that children’s test scores on various measures were fully or partly mediated by maltreatment
- Both the children currently in care and those in the foster home group were less likely to meet age-related expectations for receptive vocabulary, literacy and communication than children in the general population. **Children in the care appeared slightly more likely to meet the standard age-related expectations for receptive vocabulary than the foster home group, although this difference did not quite reach significance.** 
- In teacher assessments of communication (listening, speaking and understanding), however, the care group were significantly less likely to meet expectations than the foster home group. 
- The two groups proved to be well-matched in terms of their current age and welfare histories, and there was also little difference between them on measures of parenting style. However, children in the care group were significantly more likely to have experienced severe maltreatment. They had also experienced a significantly higher total number of risk factors, including more types of abuse and neglect and more parental problems. 
- **Differences in the pre-school skills of advantaged and disadvantaged children have been found to be predominantly in language and communication. Early language, including vocabulary development, is linked to early literacy and it is this that is linked to wider educational attainment and later-life outcomes** (Phillips and Lonigan, 2009; Marmot, 2010).
- For most children who start school behind their peers, the attainment gap will only increase throughout their school career. 
- Others have compared them to children involved with child welfare services who remain at home, with an early English study finding that foster children performed no worse than a comparison group receiving social work support in the community. **It concluded that, whilst care did not appear to compensate children for prior educational disadvantage, nor was it the cause of their poor educational achievement**


## Insights from children studying in boarding schools
*Boarding schools show us that educational outcomes are not determined by an institutional setting*

From a study on boarding and day school students, we know that[^12]
* Boarding students were more likely to report they were satisfied with their academic experience and were more likely to report that school prepared them for college.
* Boarding instills independence and acceptance of cultural diversity.
-  **Boarding for disadvantaged students enhanced their exposure to social and educational capital.****
* Found predominant parity between boarding and day students (described below), but where small effects were identified, they favored boarders.
*  Research documenting negative effects of boarding for some children. mental health and wellbeing among high school boarders (boys) as they transitioned to and into boarding school.
* **They found increases in emotional problems among boarding students over time.** 
* It has also been documented how some boarding schools are contexts perpetuating institutional and societal power structures and problematic ideologies—such as those around gender
* After controlling for background and personality attributes, **we found predominant parity between boarding and day students in their motivation, engagement, and achievement.** 
* We also found that motivation, engagement, and achievement at the class-level were not significantly affected by the number of boarders in the classroom. 
* In addition, the effects of boarding were generally not moderated by students’ background or personality attributes.
* **There is not a major difference in educational outcomes when comparing boarding and day school students.** 
* relatively few differences (with small effect sizes) in academic wellbeing (e.g., domain-general academic motivation and engagement) and personal wellbeing.
* **found that disadvantaged students in boarding initially experienced low levels of wellbeing, but their wellbeing adjusted during their boarding experience.** 


# Major barriers of academic success for OVC 
*According to a report that looks at child performance in five different sites in developing countries[^1], The ill effects of being an orphaned or abandoned child (OAC) in a LMIC are reported to include **fewer years of schooling, poorer school performance, poorer households, less adequate housing, increased malnutrition, higher morbidity and mortality, poorer access to medical care, and a higher prevalence of depression***

- Many young people in care experience frequent placement moves, affecting their school attendance and performance.
- In developing countries, a significant obstacle to the education of children and young people in care is the financing arrangements of residential care facilities. Most facilities depend heavily on funding from donors and volunteers (Keshavarzian & Borgstr€om, 2020). While funds from donors allow the facilities to educate the children, it has its challenges 
- In addition, a growing phenomenon in Africa and Asia is orphanage tourism, where tourists and volunteers are allowed to visit and stay in care facilities for a fee or donation. However, some activities of the visitors disrupt the children’s education. For instance, the children sometimes miss school to rehearse and undertake performances to entertain donors visiting the residential facility 
- Many young people have difficulty persisting with their education after leaving care. 
- Most African countries lack statutory after-care services and support for care leavers. 
- Without support, many care leavers in India, Zimbabwe, and Philippines face financial difficulties and the pressure to earn an income which forces them to postpone their education
- Evidence from Ghanaian care-leaving research suggests that many young people who leave care experience challenges with employment, housing, and social integration (Frimpong-Manso, 2018). 
* The care leavers who have good outcomes are often those who have the opportunity to stay longer in care to finish their education and also have financial and material support from the residential facility after leaving care (Frimpong-Manso, 2018).

## Lack of Educational Support and Guidance:
- Staff’s **low expectations and lack of belief** in their academic potential had negative consequences for the young people’s educational outcomes, as they did little to promote their aspiration for higher education. 
- An interesting finding from this study is that for some of the young people, t**he extremely high expectations** of the staff members also had a negative influence on their education because, as revealed by other research (e.g., Murayama et al., 2016), the unrealistic expectations of adults put undue pressure on young people. This contributed to them experiencing low self-esteem and eventual disengagement from school
- Many of the young people who took part in the study suggested that an impediment to their education was the **lack of support to compensate for their pre-care losses**. Many children, before they enter care, lag behind their peers academically because they have special educational needs due to their experiences of abuse, mental health issues, or disability. 
- Many of them had never or hardly attended school before entering care. However, despite this disadvantage, they felt that they did not get enough guidance and mentoring from their carers and teachers. 
- Most of the staff paid little attention to their studies or had difficulty helping with subjects such as maths or science
- Several of the participants also reiterated that adults in the children’s homes often had low expectations and aspirations for those who were academically weak. 
- The participants reiterated that those considered academically weak, especially the females, were advised by the staff of the children’s homes to shelve their higher educational aspirations in favor of lower courses such as vocational training, even if that was not what they wanted to do
	- In India, young people in care often have to opt for vocational courses because the institutions have difficulty finding donors to fund expensive courses like medicine (Azam et al., 2019). 
- Previous Ghanaian research (Darkwah et al., 2016) shows that staff in residential facilities generally have low academic qualifications and minimal on-the-job training, which probably contributed to their failure to assess the young people’s academic competence or give them academic support outside school hours.

## Non-participation in Educational Decisions
- Children in care are not consulted or given opportunities to communicate their views on decisions. Without their participation, the young people end up in courses that they have little interest in or ability to pursue, leading to many dropping out or struggling to attain good qualifications. 
- Enabling children to take part in decisions helps professionals to identify their needs and improves their self-esteem and confidence
- The young people then felt pressured to accept the decisions with little consideration given to their wishes
- Many of the participants felt that the decisions and advice given by some staff were poor and not always in their best interest. The young people felt disempowered and disoriented by the decisions they disagreed with but forced to accept. This included not being allowed to attend their preferred school or doing the course that they wanted. 

## Stigma
- Stigma emerged from the study as a barrier to academic progress. Negative comments from teachers and schoolmates because of their care background made school unlikable for many of the young people in the study. These experiences of stigma resulted in some even dropping out, disrupting their education 
- Some of the interviewees mentioned that they experienced stigma in school, which impeded their academic progress. According to them, certain organizational policies intended to assist them rather became a source of stigma. For example, though they did not want people to find out they were living in a children’s home, being taken to school in the institution’s bus revealed their care status 
- Many of the participants indicated that once their mates found out they were from the children’s home, they experienced different forms of stigma, discrimination and social exclusion
- Low self-esteem among OVC was found to be a contributing factor to poor performance in education as T6SA said “self-esteem is … related to low morale and their performances are disturbed”.

## Impact of social deprivation and trauma:
According to paper on the educational outcomes of children in care
- Children and young people in care have almost universally had a difficult start in life. 
- Most children in care are from socially disadvantaged backgrounds, often from families with high numbers of contacts with mental health and alcohol and other drug treatment services. 
-  Many children have experienced significant trauma, and this can have long-term impact on educational engagement and outcomes.

## Poor teaching support
According to a paper on educational support for OVC in South Africa, 
* Findings from our study indicated that the challenges deterring teachers from supporting OVC include lack of sufficient time for individual attention to OVC. As one teacher said, “we have no sufficient time to support individual children” (T2SA)
* Wood and Goba (2011) noted that teachers trained in life orientation felt a sense of being marginalised by their colleagues who left OVC for them to deal with. On the other hand OVC experienced stigma which was challenging for life orientation teachers who could not prevent it from happening.
* Reading and writing were other challenges that OVC struggled with. Twenty six (40%) learners reported that they were not able to write like other children while 14 (23%) indicated they were not able to read like others.
* This challenge could be connected to lack of sufficient time for teachers to attend to learners individually, leaving OVC struggling on their own.
* Lack of concentration among OVC, submitting school work late and not doing their school/homework were other challenges cited as likely to have negative influence on OVC’s education.
- According to a paper on improving foster children's performance in schools[^9], these are a couple of crucial factors for determining performance
	- Teachers’ positive expectations:
        * As stated by authors as Mitchell (2006), and shown in meta analysis by Hattie (2009), teachers’ positive expectations of academic performance have a substantial impact on children’s school achievements. 
    * Feedback on students’ performance:
        * Another important factor promoting good school results is feedback on students’ performance. Hattie clarifies that effective feedback should cover three aspects: 
            * What direction am I heading? 
            * How am I doing? 
            * What is my next step forward? 
    * Formal assessment of performance:
        * A third strong factor in Hattie’s syntheses is formal assessment of performance (effect size 0.90). In the Skolfam model these three factors are applie

## Lack of parental support
* Mwoma & Pillay (2015) noted that parents/guardians were not supportive to OVC in relation to homework. Pillay (2011) revealed that learners from child headed households lacked support and they mostly had negative experiences in their homes characterised by abject poverty.

## Home environment
* Absenteeism and lateness to school were other challenges likely to negatively influence OVC’s academic performance.
* Mishra and Bignami-Van Assche (2008) revealed that various reasons could make OVC be at greater risk of absenteeism and dropping out of school. The reasons according to them would include inability to pay fees, need to help with household labour or having to stay at home to care for sick parents or younger children.
* Ebersohn and Eloff, (2002) observed that due to the death of parents and close relatives as a result of HIV/AIDS, families have been disrupted causing an increase of destitute and abandoned children in South Africa.
* This was supported by findings from our study where OVC were reported to be relocating from relative to relative while others could not do their homework indicating that they lacked supervision and support in their home.
* Cleanliness among OVC was another challenge indicating that OVC are not supervised at home to ensure personal hygiene. Being the first teachers and protectors of their children, parents have a primary responsibility of ensuring that children have a conducive social environment at home.
* Bronfenbrenner (1979) identified the home as the microsystem where children are socialised to learn how to interact with other social agents in society. Supervision of children by parents/guardians ensures that children become responsible and are not rendered vulnerable to the law by becoming violent to other children or by destroying property (Sund, 2006). 
* Supervision at home could include ensuring that children are encouraged to do home/schoolwork, observe personal hygiene, and that parents/guardians work hand in hand with teachers to ensure that OVC attend school regularly as these were major negative challenges reported to be influencing the education for OVC

## School disruption and absenteeism
- The impact of the school disruption often caused by placement changes is another theme addressed in several studies. This is a contested topic, with some research showing multiple school changes contribute to poor educational outcomes, and other studies showing they have negligible impact. 
- Lima et al. (2018) found that young people in care with more than five placements were more likely to have poorer educational outcomes than those with fewer than five placements 
- Research focussing on care leavers described school changes as a problem (Harvey et al., 2017), which is supported by evidence from an international scoping review (Luke &O’Higgins, 2018) which found that multiple placements are detrimental to educational outcomes.
- Research focusing on the opinions and views of children and young people indicates that school changes are an issue for them because it disrupts relationships with their peers and teachers and influences both their experience and engagement of school. Chronic disengagement is a key factor in absenteeism, which is another issue raised in some studies (Association of Children’s Welfare Agencies [ACWA].
- In contrast, other studies showed that children in care had better attendance than their vulnerable peers, and that regular school attendance is a key protective factor for educational outcomes.
- The evidence suggests that regardless of outcomes measured by test results, children and young people usually find placement and school changes disruptive and upsetting, particularly in the final years of schooling. 
- Placement changes and associated issues of school disruption and absenteeism are often due to issues within the care or education systems or lack of integration between them

## Care and education system
- Some authors noted issues within schools including the lack of implementation of Individual Education Plans (IEP) and the lack of skills among school staff to support children with complex trauma backgrounds
- Research also highlights issues in the care system, including a lack of support and training, inclusion in planning for carers, training for caseworkers. Other issues include unclear funding guidelines, poor communication between agencies and inadequate education resources. 
- Caseworkers raised issues around lack of time spent with children due to the reactive and regulatory focus of their work, also reporting that their emphasis was on the psychological needs of young people rather than education
- A number of studies reported that children and young people in care were concerned they weren’t being listened to or involved in decision making about education or things that affected their education. Other authors noted a lack of integration between the care and education systems and how this negatively impacts on education.

## Managing transitions
- The research suggests there are issues at each level of educational transitions. 
- Research on Australian care leavers emphasised the need for further support beyond the age of 18 and positive interventions to make the transition to tertiary study easier. 
- Other issues include the need for care leavers transitioning to university to be included in equity frameworks, and the need for better data collection about care leavers.

## Importance of relationship and agency
- Many of the papers stress the importance of a good relationship with at least one supportive adult. Other themes emerging included relationships being the most significant influence in career development for young people and the importance in a young person’s life of a relationship with a significant adult who values learning and provides emotional support to the young person.
- An international review suggests that caregiver involvement in schooling is associated with better outcomes.
- Relationships with key adults can contribute to building resilience in young people with adverse experiences 
- One study found that many young people regarded their own efforts as central to their possible success. In another study, individual agency was a key theme. Many young people took an active role in their educational progress and felt it was up to them.
- Matheson’s(2016) study directly addresses personal factors and found that care leavers in tertiary education had high aspirations and a sense of resilience, although many also felt luck played a role in their educational success. 
- Key themes from two further studies were the student’s sense of resilience and their motivation and determination to succeed.

## Gender
According to a paper exploring factors associated with educational outcomes for OVC in India[^5], 
* A situational analysis of education in India by USAID (2014) indicated that although primary school enrollment is high, the dropout rate for both boys and girls increases manifold when transitioning to higher-level classes. 
* boys become more labor force Bready^ and are directed towards paid labor.
* girls, the reasons for dropping out might include marriage, caretaking of younger siblings or ailing parents, and reservation of resources, among others.
* Interestingly, child’s gender was not a significant predictor of education outcome.
* This suggests that although child’s gender might be an important predictor of education outcomes, for this particular sample, other factors might be more influential.


## Facilitators of Academic success:

*According to a paper on the educational outcomes of children in care[^7], There are common themes among those who have done well. These include good relationships with and support from key adults, and a sense of resilience combined with high aspirations and persistence. A stable placement while attending a good school in the final years of secondary education also helps.* 

From conversations with care-leavers in Ghana, we know that[^3]
* The factors identified in various studies as contributing to the educational success of care leavers include:
    * resourcefulness and motivation, 
    * having key adults who provide guidance and encouragement, 
    * financial and practical support, 
    * and participation in extracurricular activities.
* Care leavers in many developing countries highlight the access to education as a positive feature of care. Islam (2013) argues that the positive experience is because, in Bangladesh and other developing countries, education is often viewed as a primary function of residential care as it is a vehicle for the social improvement of children who are in care mainly because of poverty. 
* Thus, compared to their pre-care lives often characterised by poverty and homelessness, the well-run facilities provide the stability for the young people to attend school

## Personal Motivation
- According to the participants, having personal motivation is an important part of academic success. Their narrations suggest that despite the challenges they experienced pre-care and in-care, they had the conviction to succeed academically to make their future better 
- Having experienced disruptions to their schooling, they saw care as an opportunity to get an education and a “better life”, something that they would not have gotten if they had stayed with their parents or extended families

## Encouragement from Adults and Peers
- Aside from the personal resources, the young people in the study also suggest that support from carers and other significant adults facilitated their academic progress
- It is therefore probable that those who had poor educational experiences and who were having difficulties after leaving care are underrepresented in this study.
- The findings seem to suggest a link between the care leaver’s educational achievement and staff members’ expectations and attitudes. From the accounts of the young people, having a significant adult who took an interest in their academic work boosted their confidence and determination to succeed, echoing the findings in other studies. 
- Several participants mentioned that the encouragement and support from adults and their peers served as an important facilitator to their academic success. 
- The adults, often their immediate carers and teachers, pushed them to do well in school and believed in their potential, which showed through their actions. According to the participants, the encouragement and advice from these adults helped them realize the importance of education
- Aside from the encouragement and motivation, the adults provided practical support that helped many of the care leavers with their education. 
- The adults attended school events, contacted their teachers regularly to enquire about their progress, and used their own money to pay the school fees for some of the participants after they had left care
- Others received support and motivation from informal sources such as their biological relatives
- Another youth also explained that he was motivated to study harder and stay in school because his peers in care who attended university became his role models

## Stable caregivers
According to a paper on exploring factors associated with educational outcomes for orphaned children in India[^5], 
* Caregivers are the direct source of social and financial capital that ensures proper development of a child (Scott et al. 2013). 
* They are also the means to transmit policies and programs in the larger ecosystem in order to support children in attaining their rights. 
* Many studies have suggested that caregiver health and education are the most influential factors that impact a child’s educational outcome
* Caregivers with higher levels of education are more likely to support school enrollment and retain children in school, despite monetary constraints
* caregivers that have access to proper shelter, health care, food, and other basic assets have greater ability to provide good quality care to their children, thereby, improving the child’s education and health outcomes.
* Along with low-socioeconomic status, certain social and cultural factors further reduce the capability of caregivers, including gender, caste, religion, land distribution, and geographical location (Tsujita 2013).

## Characteristics of the Child:
According to a paper on exploring factors associated with educational outcomes for orphaned children in India[^5], 
* Certain child characteristics also impact educational outcomes. These include age, gender, and health of the children.
* In India, female children continue to be one of the most disadvantaged groups that are systematically left out of school due to fiscal constraints, safety, and perceived economic returns, among other reasons.
* male children in low-income families, as compared to male children in higher-income families, are more likely to be involved in work as compared to being enrolled in school. 
* although more barriers exist for female children for school enrollment, their educational achievement tends to be higher as compared to boys
* Age: While there has been an increase in primary school enrollment, UNICEF reports indicate that the secondary school enrollment rates in India still remain dismal.
* India faces a high dropout rate when children are transitioning from primary school to higher levels of education.
* a high proportion of students (15.9 %) drop out of school in grade 5 in India

## Strong Relationship between Caregiver and Child:
* The caregiver’s investment in the child’s education is based on the interplay of child, caregiver, and household characteristics
* caregivers of HIV/AIDSaffected orphans in Sub-Saharan Africa face a heavy burden of financially supporting the orphans in addition to providing for their own families. 
* In such circumstances, children that are not biologically related to the caregiver might face additional disadvantages as compared to those children that are biologically related.
* children who live in households that are headed by non-biologically related caregivers’ fare systematically worse than those living with biological parents.
* participation in educational activities by orphans residing in resource-constrained households is considered a luxury. 
* These children are often involved in paid or unpaid work and are deprived of educational opportunities due to disadvantages arising from the interaction between limited resources and relationship with the caregiver. 
* Child education outcomes were significantly associated with caregiver’s health and education. This finding supports previous studies that indicate caregiver education and health are protective factors for children at risk.
* Educated parents are more likely to understand the value of their children being educated and its long-term positive effects, irrespective of their socioeconomic status.
* if the caregiver is in poor health, he/she is less likely to be working and providing for the children.
*  children with ailing caregivers are more likely to drop out of school, and spend most of their time nursing the caregiver, or providing for the household.
* Results suggest that when caregivers have limited resources, their caretaking abilities are compromised, as they make choices about who to provide for and which household members have more value.
* orphans in households with non-biological caregivers might be more engaged in paid work to generate additional income, or be involved in household chores to reserve resources rather than utilizing it for education related expenses.





# Successful interventions in improving educational outcomes 

## Principles of improving educational outcomes for CNCP
According to. apaper on the educational outcomes of children in care[^6], 

* Stigma and low expectations can perhaps be best addressed through awareness raising and better education of agency and school staff. 
* School disruption and other issues raised in the literature tend to reflect issues in the care systems and the way resources are allocated, managed and prioritised. 
* Much of the research includes recommendations about providing better services to young people by better training of staff, stabilising placements, reviewing corporate parenting practices, better integration of the care and education systems, valuing education and providing more support for young people transitioning out of the care system
* There is a need for all workers in the sector to be aware of and trained to manage the ongoing impacts of trauma on children and young people in care. 
* Workers should also try to minimise placement changes that lead to school disruption, especially in the final years of school. They should contribute to a culture that values education, supports young people to build resilience and has high expectations of them.
* The findings of this scoping review are not new findings. The 2010 report which informed the National Standards for OHC raised similar issues around stability, supporting transition from care, better training and support for carers and workers, improvements in practice and relationships, more inclusive decision making and improved access to support services. 
## Welcome policy changes 
- According to a paper on educational support for orphans and vulnerable children in South Africa[^4], 
	- Our study revealed that the government through the implementation of a no fee policy in schools, enabled OVC to access their basic education. This was confirmed by 57 (88%) learners indicating that the government paid their fees and 48 (74%) learners indicating that this support enabled many of them to access education.
	- Findings further revealed that schools through the government soup kitchens provided meals to OVC where 63 (96%) learners and 38 (90.5%) teachers confirmed this fact.

## School feeding program

* Food and nutrition are important components for OVC’s support (PEPFAR, 2006). USAID and CRS (2008) pointed out that school feeding programs can enable children in general and OVC in particular to access education by addressing hunger and the need to work to survive. Findings from our study revealed that although schools had feeding programs, some OVC lacked meals in their homes compelling them to come to school without having breakfast.
* Eight (12%) learners also confirmed this fact that OVC did not have meals at home. Due to lack of food at home, some OVC would even come to school when they were sick to have one meal a day provided in school. 
* Some schools are trying to provide food parcels for OVC to take home, but they experience further challenges in providing enough for family members. For others some OVC lacked lunch boxes to carry the food home.

## Supporting OVC with school work
* Mwoma & Pillay (2015) maintained that in supporting OVC, life orientation skills are critical for OVC especially those taking care of their ailing parents/guardians. However this support was missing as 54% of the teachers and 31% of the OVC indicated that they are not taught how to care for sick persons at home, implying the children struggle on their own. This may have indirect influence on their participation in education as they may not attend school regularly or do homework. 
* Among the strategies identified that could be used to improve support for OVC with school work at the meso and exosystem levels is the need for government to employ more teachers to support OVC after school hours.
* Participants also suggested that there should be a social worker in each school, to whom OVC could be referred for further support.
* Findings further indicated that for OVC to be supported effectively there is need for a collective responsibility from teachers, parents/guardians, and government to ensure that OVC are supported in their educational needs. Each of these stakeholders should play their roles effectively to support OVC both at home and in school in line with Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) findings that the home, the school, the government and the community at large have a critical role in a child’s development and learning.


### Provision of feeding programs 
* Feeding children is very important in ensuring that they have energy to play and learn and have good health. Findings from our study indicated that some children came to school without breakfast, indicating that they could be starving at home. To mitigate this, interviewees suggested that there is a need to provide food parcels for OVC to take home.
* USAID and CRS (2008) maintain that take home rations have been shown to promote participation, progression and retention of OVC in education. They further argue that, children who are not hungry are better able to concentrate in class. Therefore, providing food parcels for OVC is critical in ensuring that they do not go to school hungry. 


### Strengthening caregiver systems
* McGuckin and Minton (2014) in supporting the ecological systems theory maintain that the environment in which a child grows up, plays a critical role in shaping the relationship between the child and his/her development. The family, school and neighbourhood has the most and earliest influence on the child’s development (Krishnan, 2010).
* Thus providing the educational needs for OVC by family members and the school community is important in enhancing the educational performance of OVC.
* Findings from our study revealed that, in order for OVC to get adequate support from guardians/parents there is a need for workshops to sensitise them to the need to fully support OVC with school/homework and to supervise their personal hygiene at home.
* PEPFAR (2006) maintained that supporting families helps build a protective environment for vulnerable children. Krishnan (2010) also pointed out that what happens in a microsystem such as home where a child lives, could influence what happens in the school and vice versa. It is imperative therefore, that capacity building for guardians/parents on the importance of supporting children under their care while at home and in school is an option that cannot be overlooked.
* Regular home visits by social workers was another strategy deemed to be supportive especially for social workers to identify the various needs of OVC alongside the needs of parents/guardians with a view of identifying the appropriate ways of meeting those needs.
* Identifying needy guardians/parents for OVC and providing them with social grants was another strategy cited to ensure that they are able to purchase necessities for these children to promote their personal hygiene.

According to a paper that reviewed educational interventions for children in care,these are some of the interesting interventions tried across the world along with the their results [^7]

### Kids in Transition to School

- The intervention was delivered within the school setting
- This is a classroom-based program delivered 2 months prior to kindergarten entry and during the first 2 months of school.
- Children attend 24 sessions that address early literacy skills, prosocial skills, and self-regulatory activities. 
- Sessions comprise 12–15 children and are delivered for a period of 2 hours, twice weekly in the first phase, and once weekly in the second phase. 
- Carers attend eight parallel meetings intended to develop their capacity to support the child in practicing new skills, routines, and behavior. 
- Child sessions are delivered by a graduate-level teacher and two assistant teachers, and the carer group is delivered by a facilitator and assistant, with all completing a standardized 40-hour training program. 
- Participants also receive supplemental materials to support the implementation of new skills.

#### Results
* measured early literacy skills in children aged six and under, finding a small effect of 0.26.


##### Early Start to Emancipation Preparation (ESTEP) programme 

- The intervention was delivered in the care setting, where undergraduate and graduate students are the delivery agents.
- Young people meet with a tutor twice a week within the care setting and receive up to 50 hours of tutoring in a math, spelling, reading, and vocabulary curriculum.
- Tutors receive one day of training on commencement of the intervention and ongoing development twice a year.
- A mentoring relationship is also anticipated, with youth acquiring the skills and experience to develop healthy relationships. 

#### Results
 The ESTEP programme found no impacts on letter word identification, calculation or passage comprehension.
* The authors hypothesize that a large number of young people enter care due to mental health and behavioral problems, with this being evidenced by the fact that 6.5% of the study sample tested positive for post-traumatic stress, 35.1% reported having been in special educational programs prior to the study, and 26.1% reported a learning disability. 
* They suggest that the graduate students who delivered the intervention did not have the specialist training necessary to serve these youth, and specialist teachers may be more appropriate delivery agents.
* found no effect on grade completion at 26.8-month follow-up.
* It assessed the impact on school behavior, which was a composite measure of getting along with teachers; paying attention in school; getting your homework done; getting along with other students, and arriving on time for class. At approximately 2 years post-baseline the intervention demonstrated no effect.



##### Teach Your Children Well (TYCW) approach

- The interventions were delivered by carers within the care setting.
- The individual-level Teach Your Children Well focuses on direct one-to-one instruction by trained foster carers.
- Intervention includes 3 hours of instruction per week, comprising 2 hours one-to-one instruction in reading, 30 minutes reading aloud by the foster child, and 30 minutes self-paced instruction in maths. The small-group-based Teach Your Children Well involves one or two trained university students delivering the curriculum to 3–4 children.
- The duration is 25 weeks-30 weeks

#### Results
* Reported positive effects on sentence comprehensio and math computation. There was no significant impact on word reading or spelling.
* It was reported that single children had significant improvements in word reading, sentence comprehension, reading composite, and maths, while sibling pairs only indicated significance for math computation.
* The evaluation found that ADHD, mental health, internalized and externalized behaviors, as defined by the Child Behavior Checklist, moderated the relationship between the intervention and academic skills.


##### Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care for Adolescents (MTFC-A) 

- Delivers training and supervision to specialist foster parents for a nine-month period, with a short period of aftercare.
- There is also the Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care (MTFC) intervention which caters to young girls leaving the juvenile system. The intervention involves moving into a specialist foster placement for an average duration of 174 days.

#### Results
* Evaluation of group-based Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care for Adolescents indicated no impact on scholastic or language skills.
* Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care for young girls leaving the youth justice system was evaluated for homework completion on three days in a one-week period at 3–6 months and 12 months post-baseline. At both time points the intervention group spent more days on homework than the control group; individuals in the intervention group spent approximately 150% more days in a week on homework at 12 months post-baseline, while the control group experienced a decline in the time allocated to this task.
* School attendance was assessed and it was found that Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care for young girls leaving the juvenile system had an effect at the level at 12 months post-baseline. 

##### The Letterbox Club 

- This intervention was delivered in the care setting, but there was no delivery agent and the learning was child-led. 
- It is a gifting intervention that provides personalized educational resources to children in foster care, with resources including books, stationary items and mathematical games.
- Parcels are delivered to the child on a monthly basis over a six-month period. The intervention does not rely on, expect or demand foster carer involvement.

#### Results
* Evaluation of the Letterbox Club reported no effect on reading accuracy, reading comprehension, or reading rate. 
* In the trial of education specialists, it reported differences between the intervention group and control group at baseline but no significant differences at follow-up for maths test achievement scores (p = .082) or reading test achievement scores (p = .448).
* It measured the impact on attitude towards reading, which included recreational reading and academic reading, in addition to the liking of school. At approximately eight months post-baseline there was no impact on these outcomes.


##### Head Start 
- This is non -standardized in its setting, delivery agent, and duration.
- It is a holistic, wraparound set of services intended to support disadvantaged pre-school-age children. 

#### Results
* also found an effect at 6 months post-baseline (ß = 0.16, p = 0.02) which was reported as significant. 
* At 18 months post-baseline there was no significant direct intervention effect, but there was a modest indirect effect, with gains in pre-academic skills, the establishment of positive teacher-child relationships and change in behaviour problems during Head Start predicting higher pre-academic skills in the following year.
* Head Start, measured teacher-student relationships. At six months post-baseline there was a significant effect for the intervention


##### The Fostering Individualized Assistance Program (FIAP)
- It is delivered by family specialists who serve as family-centered, clinical case managers and home-based counselors working across all settings in tailoring services for individual children.
- On receipt of a referral, the specialist advises the welfare agency, advocates for the young person, and investigates alternative school options.

#### Results:
* indicated that at 42-month follow-up those in the control group were 2.5 times more likely to engage in an extreme proportion of days on suspension (>1% of school days).
* When the population was separated into a younger and older subset, there was no significant effect for the younger group but a significant impact was retained for the older category, with the control group being more than four times as likely to be suspended.
* evaluation of the family-specialist coordinated programme did not find any impact on the extreme number of school-to-school movements, which is defined as more than three placements per year.


##### The Way Home

- The intervention was delivered to young people who had left residential care.
- It is a 12-month intervention to support the transition of youth with or at risk of disabilities as they reintegrate into the home following a stay in out-of-home care. 
- Each family is assigned a trained family consultant who delivers the majority of the intervention.
- The program integrates three interventions. Over the duration of the intervention family consultants spend approximately 138 hours with each family.

#### Results
* reported that young people in the control group were more than three times more likely to leave school compared to those in the intervention group at 12-months post-baseline (E.S. = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.12,0.75).

### Fostering Healthy Futures
* The Fostering Healthy Futures programme is a manualized skills group that aims to reduce stigma and provide opportunities to learn social and emotional competencies within a supportive environment.
	* Groups are delivered for 30 weeks, lasting approximately 1.5 hrs each week, and comprise two trained facilitators and 8–10 children. 
	* The intervention is informed by the evidence-based PATHS curriculum and the Second Step approach.
	* Mentoring is also provided by graduate students in social work, who act as role model and advocate for the young person, meeting with them for 2–4 hours per week. 
	* An RCT has been conducted with 156 children aged 9–11 in foster care due to maltreatment. 
	* The primary outcome was mental health, and at 15 months post-baseline the intervention groups scored significantly lower on multi-informant measures of poor mental health. Secondary educational outcomes were measured as part of the trial and analysis is currently being undertaken.


## Individual Education Planning
**Note: An IEP is often created by the teacher; but can be adapted to different settings**
According to an articule that discusses development and implmentation of individual education plans for children with special needs[^2], 


### Key Characteristics of an IEP

### Special
- An individual education plan can be the medium by which we put the special into special education. 
- It is, by necessity, about going beyond what is normally available in the curriculum, and specifies what is particular and special about the provision that is being offered to an individual student, irrespective of the place where that provision is delivered.

### Individualised
* Each individual education plan is tailor made for a particular student. 
* IEPs produced for children with special needs should not look the same, and those produced for children attending the same class should not have identical targets. 
* The individualised nature of the planning depends on in-depth knowledge of a child’s strengths, needs and aspirations. 

### Short Shelf Life
- Has a shelf life of one year (max)
- An individual educational plan should not cover more than one academic year, because to extend further than that would lead us into distant speculation and vagueness. 
- The IEP is a more immediate plan that specifies the learning and teaching that will happen in a relatively short time frame. 
- IEPs can be written for a term or even a week, but the time frames must be realistic. 
- Often a written IEP covers a full academic year and, at the same time, more detailed targets are developed for weekly or termly instruction. 

### Targets and goals are specified
- The individual educational plan specifies the targets and goals that a student will achieve within a given time frame. 
- It should be noted that the term educational is used in its broadest sense and goals can include social targets, self-help skills, attendance goals as well as targets for academic learning and cognitive development. 

### Specifies teaching methods and supporting strategies
- The individual education plan also specifies how these targets and goals will be taught in terms of the methods and resources that will be used to support the learning.

### Regularly reviewed
- An IEP needs to be monitored and reviewed, not least to gauge whether or not it is being effective. 
- Systems for doing this can vary widely and there is no doubt that a key adult needs to take responsibility for coordinating information to ensure that reviewing is effective. 

### Shared with the students
- A really effective IEP is one that the student understands and to which he or she is committed. 
- Depending on the student’s level of skill, he or she can be engaged in the process from the very beginning, from planning through to self monitoring and review

### Parents & Caregivers participate
- Parents play a crucial role in helping to develop meaningful goals and in implementing aspects of the agreed plan. Their involvement and commitment is essential to the process. 

### Be a working document
- Most of all a meaningful individual educational plan is a working document, which can be modified in light of experience and must be responsive to changing situations. 
- It is always discouraging to hear any of these key participants say that an IEP exists, but they are not sure what it says or where it is. 
- This suggests that the IEP exists in paper only and is without meaning or value. It should be a guide to which students, teachers and parents refer on an on-going basis.

## Need for an IEP:
### An IEP makes best use of assessments
- Most children now attending special educational provision have been assessed by a psychologist. 
- A comprehensive psychological report should include information about the child’s learning strengths and difficulties and suggestions for supporting the child in his or her learning

### It is an opportunity to share information
- Everyone concerned with the child can share information in a planning meeting. This develops a collaborative approach and encourages participation and commitment

### It establishes priorities:
- Sometimes when we work with a child with special educational needs, those needs can appear quite overwhelming
- In these cases it can seem hard to know where to start. However, in the context of a planning meeting, the participants can discuss the issues and agree priorities. 
- This can help teachers and parents to feel less burdened, because there is some plan of action and a sense of purpose

### It clarifies expectations
- The process of developing an IEP helps all parties to be clear about what to expect in the coming year
- The IEP process allows all parties to discuss the priorities and goals and usually goes a long way to dispel anxieties about progress.

### It engages parents
- The IEP process can offer an opportunity to talk about a child’s gifts and strengths, their hopes and plans and what will be done to help them. 
- It can be a positive experience, not least because it is highly practical and has a problem solving focus. 
- Parents who are otherwise reluctant to attend school based meetings, may be more willing to attend meetings to develop individual plans, because there is a sense that their unique child is individually valued and that such a meeting is purposeful

### It motivates students
- The individual education plan gives them specific goals that are realistic and attainable and allows the students to have a sense of purpose.

### It documents success
- The individual education plan allows all parties (parents, teachers and students) to look back on their work and document the progress made and the record successes.

### It facilitates review
- The IEP allows for more thorough reviews, not just of what the child has learnt, but also of what teaching methods were found useful. 
- One special school principal who has used an IEP system across the whole school noted that the quality of school reports improved significantly once the system was established.

### It provides on-going information
- As the process of IEPs becomes established in a school, the IEP itself becomes a tool for planning and reviewing. 
- The previous IEP can, and should, be used to plan the next IEP and there is an invaluable record of priorities, plans, targets achieved and not achieved and resources deployed.


# The making of an IEP
### Getting started
- In schools where there is little or no experience of devising IEPs, the tasks of gathering information, organising planning meetings, recording targets and reviewing can seem very daunting. 
- Inevitably, like any new process, the first few attempts will be experienced as unfamiliar and there will be elements of resistance, confusion and difficulty. 
- It should also be remembered that the process will be far more time-consuming at first and with experience the various elements will not seem so cumbersome and demanding.

### Training 
- The next step is to organise adequate training for staff. This could be organised through your local teacher’s centre, or perhaps through a professional body such as IATSE/ ILSA.

### Gathering Information
- A key task in developing an IEP is to gather information from relevant sources. It is important that one adult has overall responsibility for the IEP. 
- This is particularly important in situations where a child has contact with many people in the course of his or her school day. 
- Some information can be gathered before a planning meeting takes place, and particular care needs to be taken to ensure the meaningful collaboration of parents and children

### Writing targets
- Under the terms of the Act, long term goals, targets and strategies would all be part of the section ‘goals which the child is to achieve over a period not exceeding 12 months.’
- The first task is to identify the child’s strengths and difficulties (the nature and degree of the child’s abilities, skills and talents and the nature and degree of the child’s special educational needs and how those affect his/ her progress). 
- It is most important that information is recorded in precise behavioural terms. The greater the level of detail at this stage, the more likely that targets will be accurate and relevant
- It is at this preparation stage that objective data is most useful, because it allows us to set realistic targets, it gives a clear baseline from which to work and it establishes clarity about the current level of functioning
- Ideally teachers should prepare a written account of the child’s level of skill in key areas (the present level of educational performance of the child). 
- On the basis of the above information it should be possible to agree a summary statement about the child’s special educational needs, (the special educational needs of the child). 
- The next step is to talk about priorities and long term goals. It is very useful for a teacher to ask her/himself, ‘What do I want this child to be doing at the end of this year that she/ he cannot do now?’. 
- To foster positive thinking, it can be helpful to say, ‘It would be great if…’. This question should be explicitly aired at the planning meeting to have as much consensus as possible. The answer to such a question usually gives the whole IEP endeavour a focus.
- The next step is to compose some targets. These should relate very directly to the needs identified in the first section and should also build on the gifts and strengths identified. Again, precise terms are essential if the targets are to be meaningful. 
- Some practitioners refer to SMART targets (specific, measurable, agreed, realistic, timed). It is not necessary to become torturously convoluted and pedantic, but it is essential that the targets are written in such a way that they can be effectively evaluated.

### Specifying strategies
- This is a vital step in articulating what is special about the special education that the student is offered. Where relevant, teachers should state the ways in which targets are to be delivered

### Parental Involvement
- In some situations it may be better if the parents' views are sought before the planning meeting, either by informal meeting, questionnaire or by telephone interview. 
- These mechanisms need not be overly time-consuming and allow professionals to be aware of parental issues in advance of the meeting. 
- This also allows parents to have a structured framework to work through in advance of the meeting and may help them to clarify their own thoughts and have some sense of what to expect. 
- In some cases the parents need not attend the planning meeting, but their contribution may be recorded, shared at the meeting, and the IEP can be drafted by the multidisciplinary team and then shared with the parent subsequently in a more informal meeting.
    * Parents do often ask, ‘What can I do to help my child?’ and teachers should give this question some prior consideration. 
    * Parents may volunteer to undertake a task, such as listening to a child read every evening. 
    * Parents may also be involved in monitoring behaviour. Most importantly, parents can be engaged in the giving of rewards.

### Student Participation
- In these cases a familiar and sympathetic adult should spend some time with the student in advance of the meeting, eliciting his/her views. 
- Schools can develop a very simple proforma prompt sheet with relevant questions and issues. 
- If the student will not be attending the meeting, his/ her views should be shared with the group. 
- Some schools have found it useful to ask the student to join the meeting towards the end of the process

### Monitoring
- An IEP needs some amount of on-going monitoring. A key member of staff needs to have an overview of the targets and of the child’s progress. 
- Certainly, staff should not be doggedly implementing a strategy that does not work, just because it is specified in the original IEP.

### Reviewing
- Reviews should actively involve the child and parents, as well as teachers and support staff. There are a range of different ways of organising reviews. It is usually best if any system developed fits in as far as possible with existing school structures
- There should be some written documentation, even if it is a scribbled, dated note on the original IEP which notes which targets have been achieved. This will be invaluable information for the following year when the IEP for the next academic year is being prepared. 
- In a formal review meeting key questions which need to be asked are: 
        * What progress has the child made? 
        * Which targets have been achieved?  
        * How successful were the strategies used? 
        * What are the next steps? 
        * Should alternative strategies be tried? 
        * Is a more detailed assessment needed? 
        * Is everyone clear about what has been agreed? 
        * Who will do what, by when?


# Recommendations for an IEP:

### Beware of paperwork:
- The author advises to beware of cumbersome systems, which involve a lot of paperwork. These usually collapse or else are sustained through teacher exhaustion but are neither helpful to teachers, nor useful to children. 

### High standard quality of dialogue:
- It is far more important that the quality of dialogue during a review meeting is of the highest standard, then that the written document is pristine. Some solutions; drafted targets can be written on slips of paper and, if agreed, can be pasted onto a blank document. 

### Do not reinvent the wheel. 
- Proformas for the IEP planning sheet and the IEP document itself can be gleaned from relevant sources. With time, most schools will probably develop their own system, with tailor made paperwork, but proformas are certainly a way to get started (two are included at the end of this article). 

### Start with small number of children:
- Introducing IEPs at first can be daunting, but getting started, even with a small number of students, is the key. It is hoped that this article is helpful in giving some encouragement and practical guidance.

# Education in CCIs
## Principles of guiding education for children in CCIs
- All children are capable of being educated and learn
- All children have a rich body of natural knowledge acquired before the school process which helps them make sense of a new learning
- Children learn best when they learn in groups and interact with each other and with life around them 
- Children need to be deeply invested to one or two individuals for their own sense of emotional well-being and security and this feeling of being emotionally nurtured is key for learning 
- Learning takes place in an environment free of fear.
- All children will be in school, without exception
- Each child will be taken care of until they become financially and socially independent 

## Comprehensive education
According to Rainbow Homes, these are the essential components of an educational system in CCIs
- School support 
- Bridge 
- Sports
- Life skills
- English 
- Computer
- Recreation
- Remedial Help

## Recommended routines 
According to Rainbow homes, the four-five hours after school have to be split across 
- sports
- homework
- prior learning
- Culturual activities
- English language classes
- Library
- Computer classes
- Life skills
- Time with caregivers


## Role of teacher in CCI
According to Rainbow Homes, the teacher at a CCI plays the following roles:
- To teach primary level bridge course to children who need to become academically ready for school, to engage in age appropriate schooling 
- To help children build proficienncy in EngLISH
- To help children in high levels in school -Class V and above with subject specific expertise in Math, Science and Social Studies 
- Support children with special needs and learning disabilities. 
- While working with younger children, the teacher is also responsible for helping the younger kids inculcate good habits 
- Manage the classroom/ study room by bringing in a formal atomosphere- put up charts, use teaching aids, etc.
- Setting a learning schedule for the children 
- Working on the Individual Education Plan for each child in the CCI

## Facilities to support educational outcomes 
According to Rainbow Homes, CCIs need the following facilities 
- A TV and DVD player to show documentaries or use Computer Aided Learning 
- A portable music player 
- A laptop/PC, preferably in sufficient numbers to support digital learning in a Computer Room
- An LCD or Projector screen
- Reading material like books, magazines, newspapers, newsletters and reference books based on age differentiation

## Preparing the Child for Mainstream school
### Understanding the level of learning in Children: Baseline Assessment
- Indicates the right place for the child to start in the bridge course sequence 
- Ascertains child's current capacity and style of learning
- Sets an approximate time frame after which the child would be ready to attend the school
- Create a reference point to which child's progress is compared and tracked 


### Ensuring readiness for schools: Bridge Course
- A bridge course includes all the elements taught in a particular subject at that school level 
- Bridge age-appropriate competencies in a time-bound manner
- The course's duration and speed depends on the baseline assessment of the child- it typically takes 18-24 months 
- Exerting a gentle pressure on the child to sufficiently motivate the child is crucial 
- Use diverse learning materials to keep the child engaged

## Helping children settle into schools 
### Child-school preparation principles
- Introduce the child well in advance to the teachers and staff at the school
- Inform the child about what they need to do in case of emergencies; for eg,. if they're unwell
- Request the school to set up a buddy
- Address any fears or concerns of the child directly 
- Prepare the child with basic life skills road safety, health, hygiene, interpersonal communication.

### Outcomes for optimal child performance in school
- Disicipline and self control : Children are comfortable in a structured classroom environment after years of chaos.
- Problems with authority : Children deal with any deep rooted issues or conflicts with authority figures; learns to trust the staff and the teachers
- Academic challenges : Children are able to understand and apply what they learn in the classroom
- Hygiene: Children never look shabby; they have clean uniform, combed hair and short nails
- Health: Children avoid any health related complications in school settings, typically infectious diseases like conjunctivitis, lice, viral fever, and other skin diseases 

### Symptoms of children facing troubles in school
- Persistently refusing to go to school
- Showing a sudden drop in enthusisasm
- Quiet and withdrawn
- Silent when asked about friends or teachers
- Tries to get rid of books and uniform by hiding them or throwing them away 

### Recommended learning practices at the home
- The Homework class
- Regular monitoring of learning outcomes in school
- Learning enhancement classes
- English proficiency classes
- Computer proficiency classes
- Life skills

## Creative learning approaches in the CCI
- Project-based learning
- Peer teaching
- The Library
- Story telling
- Wall magazine/newsletter
- Quiz
- Debates
- Discussions based on films/books

# Management of comprehensive education program

## Teachers
### Recruitment,training and support
- The goal is to get trained teachers or employ graduates and offer to support them to get a teacher training certificate
- Mandatory orientation for all teachers
- Twice a year, 3-5 days of need based training workshops for all teachers 
- At least one set of trainings needs to be fully residential 

### Reflection, review and planning
- Ever two weeks all teachers reflect and review their work, planning for the next two weeks
- Each reflection includes joys, sorrows and learnings

### Necessary documentation
- Children's educational plan and progress record
- Record of lesson plans
- Assessment records
- All papers with reference to maintenance of equipment
- Records of all training workshops organized for the teachers
- Half yearly and annual reports
- Database of experts, consultants in education, resource persons and partners for collaboration



# Practices in the CCI
- Miracle foundation[^9] recommends the following educational practices in the home
	- hiring of qualified coaching teachers,who provided critical education support to children after school hours.  
	- activity-based teaching and learning method, story pedagogy,effective lesson-planning and classroom management. 
	- Aptitude testing and career 
	- counselling were conducted for children in class 10th & above by Miracle’s network of experts and consultants. 
	- adult transition planning of the children’s home aimed at supporting the children beyond 18 years of age until they become independent adults with selected opportunities, scholarship programmes for advanced education or vocational training,university academic education, professional courses that best suits each child’saptitudes and interests.
	- Children participation through children’s committees
	- on topics like discipline, health and hygiene and sports and recreation was a new learning for the children and staff.
	- child-to-child, mentorship programme was introduced in the home, where eachof the older children had one or two younger children under his or her support and observation.
- According to guidelines for institutional childcare in Ethiopia, [^12]
	- Academic Education
        * A childcare institution has the responsibility to provide educational opportunities to the children from kindergarten to higher levels of education.
        * A childcare institution shall have its own kindergarten within the compound of the childcare institution.
        * A childcare institution shall provide all the necessary educational material to the children.
        * A childcare institution shall offer supportive educational services to children with educational difficulties.
        * A childcare institution shall continue to offer support to children who join higher institutions.
        * The counsellor should follow-up the educational development of the children regularly.
        * The counsellor should prepare a quarterly report on the educational development of the children and submit the same to the administration of the childcare institution.

        * A Childcare institution shall provide all the necessary support including registration, enrolment and arrangement of transportation for beneficiaries who need to join vocational training.
        * The counsellor should follow-up the vocational development of trainees attending vocational training monthly.
        * The counsellor should prepare a quarterly report on the vocational development of children attending vocational training and submit the same to the administration of the childcare institution.
        * A childcare institution shall provide the necessary support to beneficiaries who complete vocational training in securing employment opportunities.
    * Rainbow home recommends that there needs to be a strong school-home interaction enocuraged so that the caregivers and teachers are collaborating on achieving the best outcomes for the child.
	    * Invite teachers and principals to the home for events 
	    * Sensitise the teachers about the needs of the children
