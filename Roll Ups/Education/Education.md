# The value of educational support to OVC (Orphans and Vulnerable Children)
According to a paper on the educational support for OVC in South Africa[^5], 
* Education as recognised in the convention on the rights of the child is a basic human right for all children (Committee on the Rights of the Child, 1989). A child who has access to quality primary schooling has a better chance in life. 
* A child who knows how to read and write and do basic arithmetic has a solid foundation for continued learning throughout life (USAID & CRS, 2008).
* They further observe that education benefits individuals and the whole nation as a major instrument for social and economic development (USAID & CRS, 2008)
* Hallfors et al (2011) pointed out that supporting adolescent girls to stay in school increases their chances of remaining in school, hence reducing chances of contracting HIV through early marriage. This intervention further reduces chances of girls dropping out of school
* Kelly (2002) maintained that formal school education is a powerful tool for transforming\ poverty in an environment where HIV/AIDS are rampart. He further argued that growth in education may positively influence growth out of poverty.
* Schools not only benefit the child but can serve as important resource centres to meet the broader needs of the community (PEPFAR, 2006). “Education is likely to lead to employability and can foster a child developing a sense of competence” (PEPFAR, 2006, p. 9). 
* However, Wood and Goba (2011) in their study noted that teachers perceived themselves as not adequately prepared to deal with issues affecting OVC.
* USAID and CRS (2008) point out that basic education in primary and secondary levels contribute to the reduction of poverty. It increases labour productivity, improves health and enables people to participate fully in the economy and the development of their societies.
* Thus OVC need educational interventions as they are at risk of becoming infected with HIV due to economic hardships, reduced parental care and protection and increased susceptibility to abuse, and exploitation.


# Major challenges of learning for OVC 
- According to a report that looks at child performance in five different sites in developing countries[^1], The ill effects of being an orphaned or abandoned child (OAC) in a LMIC are reported to include fewer years of schooling, poorer school performance, poorer households, less adequate housing, increased malnutrition, higher morbidity and mortality, poorer access to medical care, and a higher prevalence of depression
- According to a paper on the educational support for OVC in South Africa, we learn about the following struggles[^5]
	- Due to HIV/AIDS, the traditional structure of households is changing in affected communities, leaving vulnerable children to adapt to non-traditional families and poverty (Ebersohn & Eloff, 2002). Ebersohn and Eloff note that when parents die, some orphans are left under the care of aged grandparents or under older siblings to care for them.
	* Fleming further argued that maternal and double orphans are more discriminated against in accessing education than paternal orphans (Fleming, 2015; Case et al, 2004).
	* Vulnerable children from child-headed households are burdened with domestic and economic responsibilities, which in turn affect their participation in education in relation to attend and succeed in school (Fleming, 2015).
	* As the number of OVC grows, communities become less and less capable of addressing all their basic needs, including their ability to go to school (UNICEF, 2009)

- According to a paper on educational experiences of care leavers from Ghana, these are the following factors that affect educational attainment[^3], 
## Pre-care:
- Many children, before they enter care, lag behind their peers academically because they have special educational needs due to their experiences of abuse, mental health issues, or disability. 
- In many African countries such as Cote D’Ivoire, many vulnerable children who enter care, including orphans and those living with a disability, are often excluded from education because of poverty, the need for labor or parental sickness or death

## In-care:
- Many young people in care experience frequent placement moves, affecting their school attendance and performance.
- Also, carers and school teachers often have low expectations for young people in care and thus do not encourage them to pursue higher education 
- In developing countries, a significant obstacle to the education of children and young people in care is the financing arrangements of residential care facilities. Most facilities depend heavily on funding from donors and volunteers (Keshavarzian & Borgstr€om, 2020). While funds from donors allow the facilities to educate the children, it has its challenges 
- In India, young people in care often have to opt for vocational courses because the institutions have difficulty finding donors to fund expensive courses like medicine (Azam et al., 2019). 
- In addition, a growing phenomenon in Africa and Asia is orphanage tourism, where tourists and volunteers are allowed to visit and stay in care facilities for a fee or donation (Richter & Norman, 2010). 
- However, some activities of the visitors disrupt the children’s education. For instance, the children sometimes miss school to rehearse and undertake performances to entertain donors visiting the residential facility (Islam, 2013).
- In countries such as Bangladesh, Botswana and India, young people in or from residential care indicate facing stigma from school teachers and schoolmates because of their care or orphan background

## Aftercare: 
- Many young people have difficulty persisting with their education after leaving care. 
- Most African countries lack statutory after-care services and support for care leavers. 
- Without support, many care leavers in India, Zimbabwe, and Philippines face financial difficulties and the pressure to earn an income which forces them to postpone their education

## Facilitators of Academic success:

From conversations with care-leavers in Ghana, we know that[^3]
* The factors identified in various studies as contributing to the educational success of care leavers include:
    * resourcefulness and motivation, 
    * having key adults who provide guidance and encouragement, 
    * financial and practical support, 
    * and participation in extracurricular activities.
* Care leavers in many developing countries highlight the access to education as a positive feature of care. Islam (2013) argues that the positive experience is because, in Bangladesh and other developing countries, education is often viewed as a primary function of residential care as it is a vehicle for the social improvement of children who are in care mainly because of poverty. 
* Thus, compared to their pre-care lives often characterised by poverty and homelessness, the well-run facilities provide the stability for the young people to attend school

## Personal Motivation
- According to the participants, having personal motivation is an important part of academic success. Their narrations suggest that despite the challenges they experienced pre-care and in-care, they had the conviction to succeed academically to make their future better 
- Having experienced disruptions to their schooling, they saw care as an opportunity to get an education and a “better life”, something that they would not have gotten if they had stayed with their parents or extended families

## Encouragement from Adults and Peers
- Aside from the personal resources, the young people in the study also suggest that support from carers and other significant adults facilitated their academic progress
- It is therefore probable that those who had poor educational experiences and who were having difficulties after leaving care are underrepresented in this study.
- The findings seem to suggest a link between the care leaver’s educational achievement and staff members’ expectations and attitudes. From the accounts of the young people, having a significant adult who took an interest in their academic work boosted their confidence and determination to succeed, echoing the findings in other studies. 
- Several participants mentioned that the encouragement and support from adults and their peers served as an important facilitator to their academic success. 
- The adults, often their immediate carers and teachers, pushed them to do well in school and believed in their potential, which showed through their actions. According to the participants, the encouragement and advice from these adults helped them realize the importance of education
- Aside from the encouragement and motivation, the adults provided practical support that helped many of the care leavers with their education. 
- The adults attended school events, contacted their teachers regularly to enquire about their progress, and used their own money to pay the school fees for some of the participants after they had left care
- Others received support and motivation from informal sources such as their biological relatives
- Another youth also explained that he was motivated to study harder and stay in school because his peers in care who attended university became his role models


# Barriers to Academic Achievement
- Evidence from Ghanaian care-leaving research suggests that many young people who leave care experience challenges with employment, housing, and social integration (Frimpong-Manso, 2018). 
* The care leavers who have good outcomes are often those who have the opportunity to stay longer in care to finish their education and also have financial and material support from the residential facility after leaving care (Frimpong-Manso, 2018).

## Lack of Educational Support and Guidance:
- Staff’s low expectations and lack of belief in their academic potential had negative consequences for the young people’s educational outcomes, as they did little to promote their aspiration for higher education. 
- An interesting finding from this study is that for some of the young people, the extremely high expectations of the staff members also had a negative influence on their education. 
- Because, as revealed by other research (e.g., Murayama et al., 2016), the unrealistic expectations of adults put undue pressure on young people. This contributed to them experiencing low self-esteem and eventual disengagement from school
- Many of the young people who took part in the study suggested that an impediment to their education was the lack of support to compensate for their pre-care losses.
-  Many of them had never or hardly attended school before entering care. However, despite this disadvantage, they felt that they did not get enough guidance and mentoring from their carers and teachers. 
- Most of the staff paid little attention to their studies or had difficulty helping with subjects such as maths or science
- Several of the participants also reiterated that adults in the children’s homes often had low expectations and aspirations for those who were academically weak. 
- The staff gave them little motivation and encouragement to excel. According to the young people, these attitudes undermined their self-belief and contributed to their underachievement in school.
- The participants reiterated that those considered academically weak, especially the females, were advised by the staff of the children’s homes to shelve their higher educational aspirations in favor of lower courses such as vocational training, even if that was not what they wanted to do
- The participants from one of the residential facilities revealed that the overly high expectations of the staff affected their academic progress negatively. 
- They pointed out that the staff pushed them to attend the international college owned by the residential facility, even when they did not satisfy the admission criteria. 
- However, some young people struggled to cope with the academic work and failed several of their courses, leading to their dismissal from the college and ending their schooling
- Previous Ghanaian research (Darkwah et al., 2016) shows that staff in residential facilities generally have low academic qualifications and minimal on-the-job training, which probably contributed to their failure to assess the young people’s academic competence or give them academic support outside school hours.

## Non-participation in Educational Decisions
- Children in care are not consulted or given opportunities to communicate their views on decisions. Without their participation, the young people end up in courses that they have little interest in or ability to pursue, leading to many dropping out or struggling to attain good qualifications. 
- Like other existing research (Berridge, 2017; Wilson et al., 2019), care leavers in this study have the desire to have some control over their education. 
- The inability to do so is a denial of their rights that are enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child and recommended by the Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children. 
- Enabling children to take part in decisions helps professionals to identify their needs and improves their self-esteem and confidence
- From the accounts of almost all the young people, the staff in the orphanages mostly decided on their education and career, including making choices about schools and courses, without consulting them or explaining the reasons.
- The young people then felt pressured to accept the decisions with little consideration given to their wishes
- Many of the participants felt that the decisions and advice given by some staff were poor and not always in their best interest. The young people felt disempowered and disoriented by the decisions they disagreed with but forced to accept. This included not being allowed to attend their preferred school or doing the course that they wanted. 
- Those who did not do well in school and those who did not continue with their education blamed it on not having an interest in what they were forced to study
- The youth felt that while the staff might have had good intentions when they made choices about their education, it would have been better if they had consulted them, given them reasons behind the decisions made, or opportunities to share their opinions
- As far as personal decision-making was concerned, the young people display agency in identifying personal challenges, and then planning and implementing solutions.

## Stigma
- Stigma emerged from the study as a barrier to academic progress. Negative comments from teachers and schoolmates because of their care background made school unlikable for many of the young people in the study. These experiences of stigma resulted in some even dropping out, disrupting their education 
- However, similar to studies from Wales (Mannay et al., 2017), the practices of some residential care facilities and schools intended to aid their academic work rather generated some of the stigma the young people experienced in school
- Some of the interviewees mentioned that they experienced stigma in school, which impeded their academic progress. According to them, certain organizational policies intended to assist them rather became a source of stigma. 
- For example, though they did not want people to find out they were living in a children’s home, being taken to school in the institution’s bus revealed their care status
- The young people who attended school in their children’s home suggested that the activities of their instructors led to feeling stigmatized. 
	- Dora said, “The teachers referred to children from the children’s home as ‘our children,’ and they also separated our exam results from those of the other students.” 
- Many of the participants indicated that once their mates found out they were from the children’s home, they experienced different forms of stigma, discrimination and social exclusion
- Low self-esteem among OVC was found to be a contributing factor to poor performance in education as T6SA said “self-esteem is … related to low morale and their performances are disturbed”.

## Poor teaching support
According to a paper on educational support for OVC in South Africa, 
* Findings from our study indicated that the challenges deterring teachers from supporting OVC include lack of sufficient time for individual attention to OVC. As one teacher said, “we have no sufficient time to support individual children” (T2SA)
* Wood and Goba (2011) noted that teachers trained in life orientation felt a sense of being marginalised by their colleagues who left OVC for them to deal with. On the other hand OVC experienced stigma which was challenging for life orientation teachers who could not prevent it from happening.
* Reading and writing were other challenges that OVC struggled with. Twenty six (40%) learners reported that they were not able to write like other children while 14 (23%) indicated they were not able to read like others.
* This challenge could be connected to lack of sufficient time for teachers to attend to learners individually, leaving OVC struggling on their own.
* Lack of concentration among OVC, submitting school work late and not doing their school/homework were other challenges cited as likely to have negative influence on OVC’s education.

## Lack of parental support
* Mwoma & Pillay (2015) noted that parents/guardians were not supportive to OVC in relation to homework. Pillay (2011) revealed that learners from child headed households lacked support and they mostly had negative experiences in their homes characterised by abject poverty.

## Home environment
* Absenteeism and lateness to school were other challenges likely to negatively influence OVC’s academic performance.
* Mishra and Bignami-Van Assche (2008) revealed that various reasons could make OVC be at greater risk of absenteeism and dropping out of school. The reasons according to them would include inability to pay fees, need to help with household labour or having to stay at home to care for sick parents or younger children.
* Ebersohn and Eloff, (2002) observed that due to the death of parents and close relatives as a result of HIV/AIDS, families have been disrupted causing an increase of destitute and abandoned children in South Africa.
* This was supported by findings from our study where OVC were reported to be relocating from relative to relative while others could not do their homework indicating that they lacked supervision and support in their home.
* Cleanliness among OVC was another challenge indicating that OVC are not supervised at home to ensure personal hygiene. Being the first teachers and protectors of their children, parents have a primary responsibility of ensuring that children have a conducive social environment at home.
* Bronfenbrenner (1979) identified the home as the microsystem where children are socialised to learn how to interact with other social agents in society. Supervision of children by parents/guardians ensures that children become responsible and are not rendered vulnerable to the law by becoming violent to other children or by destroying property (Sund, 2006). 
* Supervision at home could include ensuring that children are encouraged to do home/schoolwork, observe personal hygiene, and that parents/guardians work hand in hand with teachers to ensure that OVC attend school regularly as these were major negative challenges reported to be influencing the education for OVC



# Successful interventions in improving educational outcomes 
## Welcome policy changes 
- According to a paper on educational support for orphans and vulnerable children in South Africa[^5], 
	- Our study revealed that the government through the implementation of a no fee policy in schools, enabled OVC to access their basic education. This was confirmed by 57 (88%) learners indicating that the government paid their fees and 48 (74%) learners indicating that this support enabled many of them to access education.
	- Findings further revealed that schools through the government soup kitchens provided meals to OVC where 63 (96%) learners and 38 (90.5%) teachers confirmed this fact.

## School feeding program

* Food and nutrition are important components for OVC’s support (PEPFAR, 2006). USAID and CRS (2008) pointed out that school feeding programs can enable children in general and OVC in particular to access education by addressing hunger and the need to work to survive. Findings from our study revealed that although schools had feeding programs, some OVC lacked meals in their homes compelling them to come to school without having breakfast.
* Eight (12%) learners also confirmed this fact that OVC did not have meals at home. Due to lack of food at home, some OVC would even come to school when they were sick to have one meal a day provided in school. 
* Some schools are trying to provide food parcels for OVC to take home, but they experience further challenges in providing enough for family members. For others some OVC lacked lunch boxes to carry the food home.

## Supporting OVC with school work
* Mwoma & Pillay (2015) maintained that in supporting OVC, life orientation skills are critical for OVC especially those taking care of their ailing parents/guardians. However this support was missing as 54% of the teachers and 31% of the OVC indicated that they are not taught how to care for sick persons at home, implying the children struggle on their own. This may have indirect influence on their participation in education as they may not attend school regularly or do homework. 
* Among the strategies identified that could be used to improve support for OVC with school work at the meso and exosystem levels is the need for government to employ more teachers to support OVC after school hours.
* Participants also suggested that there should be a social worker in each school, to whom OVC could be referred for further support.
* Findings further indicated that for OVC to be supported effectively there is need for a collective responsibility from teachers, parents/guardians, and government to ensure that OVC are supported in their educational needs. Each of these stakeholders should play their roles effectively to support OVC both at home and in school in line with Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) findings that the home, the school, the government and the community at large have a critical role in a child’s development and learning.


### Provision of feeding programs 
* Feeding children is very important in ensuring that they have energy to play and learn and have good health. Findings from our study indicated that some children came to school without breakfast, indicating that they could be starving at home. To mitigate this, interviewees suggested that there is a need to provide food parcels for OVC to take home.
* USAID and CRS (2008) maintain that take home rations have been shown to promote participation, progression and retention of OVC in education. They further argue that, children who are not hungry are better able to concentrate in class. Therefore, providing food parcels for OVC is critical in ensuring that they do not go to school hungry. 


### Strengthening caregiver systems
* McGuckin and Minton (2014) in supporting the ecological systems theory maintain that the environment in which a child grows up, plays a critical role in shaping the relationship between the child and his/her development. The family, school and neighbourhood has the most and earliest influence on the child’s development (Krishnan, 2010).
* Thus providing the educational needs for OVC by family members and the school community is important in enhancing the educational performance of OVC.
* Findings from our study revealed that, in order for OVC to get adequate support from guardians/parents there is a need for workshops to sensitise them to the need to fully support OVC with school/homework and to supervise their personal hygiene at home.
* PEPFAR (2006) maintained that supporting families helps build a protective environment for vulnerable children. Krishnan (2010) also pointed out that what happens in a microsystem such as home where a child lives, could influence what happens in the school and vice versa. It is imperative therefore, that capacity building for guardians/parents on the importance of supporting children under their care while at home and in school is an option that cannot be overlooked.
* Regular home visits by social workers was another strategy deemed to be supportive especially for social workers to identify the various needs of OVC alongside the needs of parents/guardians with a view of identifying the appropriate ways of meeting those needs.
* Identifying needy guardians/parents for OVC and providing them with social grants was another strategy cited to ensure that they are able to purchase necessities for these children to promote their personal hygiene.

## Individual Education Planning
**Note: An IEP is often created by the teacher; but can be adapted to different settings**
According to an articule that discusses development and implmentation of individual education plans for children with special needs[^2], 


### Key Characteristics of an IEP

### Special
- An individual education plan can be the medium by which we put the special into special education. 
- It is, by necessity, about going beyond what is normally available in the curriculum, and specifies what is particular and special about the provision that is being offered to an individual student, irrespective of the place where that provision is delivered.

### Individualised
* Each individual education plan is tailor made for a particular student. 
* IEPs produced for children with special needs should not look the same, and those produced for children attending the same class should not have identical targets. 
* The individualised nature of the planning depends on in-depth knowledge of a child’s strengths, needs and aspirations. 

### Short Shelf Life
- Has a shelf life of one year (max)
- An individual educational plan should not cover more than one academic year, because to extend further than that would lead us into distant speculation and vagueness. 
- The IEP is a more immediate plan that specifies the learning and teaching that will happen in a relatively short time frame. 
- IEPs can be written for a term or even a week, but the time frames must be realistic. 
- Often a written IEP covers a full academic year and, at the same time, more detailed targets are developed for weekly or termly instruction. 

### Targets and goals are specified
- The individual educational plan specifies the targets and goals that a student will achieve within a given time frame. 
- It should be noted that the term educational is used in its broadest sense and goals can include social targets, self-help skills, attendance goals as well as targets for academic learning and cognitive development. 

### Specifies teaching methods and supporting strategies
- The individual education plan also specifies how these targets and goals will be taught in terms of the methods and resources that will be used to support the learning.

### Regularly reviewed
- An IEP needs to be monitored and reviewed, not least to gauge whether or not it is being effective. 
- Systems for doing this can vary widely and there is no doubt that a key adult needs to take responsibility for coordinating information to ensure that reviewing is effective. 

### Shared with the students
- A really effective IEP is one that the student understands and to which he or she is committed. 
- Depending on the student’s level of skill, he or she can be engaged in the process from the very beginning, from planning through to self monitoring and review

### Parents & Caregivers participate
- Parents play a crucial role in helping to develop meaningful goals and in implementing aspects of the agreed plan. Their involvement and commitment is essential to the process. 

### Be a working document
- Most of all a meaningful individual educational plan is a working document, which can be modified in light of experience and must be responsive to changing situations. 
- It is always discouraging to hear any of these key participants say that an IEP exists, but they are not sure what it says or where it is. 
- This suggests that the IEP exists in paper only and is without meaning or value. It should be a guide to which students, teachers and parents refer on an on-going basis.

## Need for an IEP:
### An IEP makes best use of assessments
- Most children now attending special educational provision have been assessed by a psychologist. 
- A comprehensive psychological report should include information about the child’s learning strengths and difficulties and suggestions for supporting the child in his or her learning

### It is an opportunity to share information
- Everyone concerned with the child can share information in a planning meeting. This develops a collaborative approach and encourages participation and commitment

### It establishes priorities:
- Sometimes when we work with a child with special educational needs, those needs can appear quite overwhelming
- In these cases it can seem hard to know where to start. However, in the context of a planning meeting, the participants can discuss the issues and agree priorities. 
- This can help teachers and parents to feel less burdened, because there is some plan of action and a sense of purpose

### It clarifies expectations
- The process of developing an IEP helps all parties to be clear about what to expect in the coming year
- The IEP process allows all parties to discuss the priorities and goals and usually goes a long way to dispel anxieties about progress.

### It engages parents
- The IEP process can offer an opportunity to talk about a child’s gifts and strengths, their hopes and plans and what will be done to help them. 
- It can be a positive experience, not least because it is highly practical and has a problem solving focus. 
- Parents who are otherwise reluctant to attend school based meetings, may be more willing to attend meetings to develop individual plans, because there is a sense that their unique child is individually valued and that such a meeting is purposeful

### It motivates students
- The individual education plan gives them specific goals that are realistic and attainable and allows the students to have a sense of purpose.

### It documents success
- The individual education plan allows all parties (parents, teachers and students) to look back on their work and document the progress made and the record successes.

### It facilitates review
- The IEP allows for more thorough reviews, not just of what the child has learnt, but also of what teaching methods were found useful. 
- One special school principal who has used an IEP system across the whole school noted that the quality of school reports improved significantly once the system was established.

### It provides on-going information
- As the process of IEPs becomes established in a school, the IEP itself becomes a tool for planning and reviewing. 
- The previous IEP can, and should, be used to plan the next IEP and there is an invaluable record of priorities, plans, targets achieved and not achieved and resources deployed.


# The making of an IEP
### Getting started
- In schools where there is little or no experience of devising IEPs, the tasks of gathering information, organising planning meetings, recording targets and reviewing can seem very daunting. 
- Inevitably, like any new process, the first few attempts will be experienced as unfamiliar and there will be elements of resistance, confusion and difficulty. 
- It should also be remembered that the process will be far more time-consuming at first and with experience the various elements will not seem so cumbersome and demanding.

### Training 
- The next step is to organise adequate training for staff. This could be organised through your local teacher’s centre, or perhaps through a professional body such as IATSE/ ILSA.

### Gathering Information
- A key task in developing an IEP is to gather information from relevant sources. It is important that one adult has overall responsibility for the IEP. 
- This is particularly important in situations where a child has contact with many people in the course of his or her school day. 
- Some information can be gathered before a planning meeting takes place, and particular care needs to be taken to ensure the meaningful collaboration of parents and children

### The planning meeting
- This is the most crucial component of the process. The IEP planning meeting, with time, may also become the forum in which an IEP is reviewed 
- In essence, the people who need to attend this meeting are those involved directly in the child’s educational provision. 
- Let’s start with the professional staff. In a mainstream setting this should include the mainstream class teacher, the special education teacher and ideally the school principal. 
- Other concerned professionals such as the educational psychologist or speech and language therapist may be invited as appropriate
- One person needs to chair the meeting, and ideally, another can make some written notes. With experience it is possible to have a completed IEP written and ready for distribution at the end of the meeting
	- A typical agenda could include: 
        * Introducing participants 
        * Identifying child’s strengths and gifts 
        * Identifying child’s needs and difficulties 
        * Suggested priorities 
        * Suggested targets in key areas, with suggested strategies
        * Agreed actions 
        * Review date set
    * An IEP should meet the requirements set out in section 9 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act. This specifies the content of the IEP as follows: 
        * The nature and degree of the child’s abilities, skills and talents 
        * The nature and degree of the child’s special educational needs and how these needs affect his/ her progress 
        * The present level of educational performance of the child 
        * The special educational needs of the child 
        * The special education and related support services to be provided to the child 
        * The goals which the child is to achieve over a period not exceeding 12 months

### Agreed Actions
- During the planning meeting, it is very important that all participants are aware of who is going to implement which aspects of the IEP. 

### Writing targets
- Under the terms of the Act, long term goals, targets and strategies would all be part of the section ‘goals which the child is to achieve over a period not exceeding 12 months.’
- The first task is to identify the child’s strengths and difficulties (the nature and degree of the child’s abilities, skills and talents and the nature and degree of the child’s special educational needs and how those affect his/ her progress). 
- It is most important that information is recorded in precise behavioural terms. The greater the level of detail at this stage, the more likely that targets will be accurate and relevant
- It is at this preparation stage that objective data is most useful, because it allows us to set realistic targets, it gives a clear baseline from which to work and it establishes clarity about the current level of functioning
- Ideally teachers should prepare a written account of the child’s level of skill in key areas (the present level of educational performance of the child). 
- On the basis of the above information it should be possible to agree a summary statement about the child’s special educational needs, (the special educational needs of the child). 
- The next step is to talk about priorities and long term goals. It is very useful for a teacher to ask her/himself, ‘What do I want this child to be doing at the end of this year that she/ he cannot do now?’. 
- To foster positive thinking, it can be helpful to say, ‘It would be great if…’. This question should be explicitly aired at the planning meeting to have as much consensus as possible. The answer to such a question usually gives the whole IEP endeavour a focus.
- The next step is to compose some targets. These should relate very directly to the needs identified in the first section and should also build on the gifts and strengths identified. Again, precise terms are essential if the targets are to be meaningful. 
- Some practitioners refer to SMART targets (specific, measurable, agreed, realistic, timed). It is not necessary to become torturously convoluted and pedantic, but it is essential that the targets are written in such a way that they can be effectively evaluated.

### Specifying strategies
- This is a vital step in articulating what is special about the special education that the student is offered. Where relevant, teachers should state the ways in which targets are to be delivered

### Parental Involvement
- In some situations it may be better if the parents' views are sought before the planning meeting, either by informal meeting, questionnaire or by telephone interview. 
- These mechanisms need not be overly time-consuming and allow professionals to be aware of parental issues in advance of the meeting. 
- This also allows parents to have a structured framework to work through in advance of the meeting and may help them to clarify their own thoughts and have some sense of what to expect. 
- In some cases the parents need not attend the planning meeting, but their contribution may be recorded, shared at the meeting, and the IEP can be drafted by the multidisciplinary team and then shared with the parent subsequently in a more informal meeting.
    * Parents do often ask, ‘What can I do to help my child?’ and teachers should give this question some prior consideration. 
    * Parents may volunteer to undertake a task, such as listening to a child read every evening. 
    * Parents may also be involved in monitoring behaviour. Most importantly, parents can be engaged in the giving of rewards.

### Student Participation
- In these cases a familiar and sympathetic adult should spend some time with the student in advance of the meeting, eliciting his/her views. 
- Schools can develop a very simple proforma prompt sheet with relevant questions and issues. 
- If the student will not be attending the meeting, his/ her views should be shared with the group. 
- Some schools have found it useful to ask the student to join the meeting towards the end of the process

### Monitoring
- An IEP needs some amount of on-going monitoring. A key member of staff needs to have an overview of the targets and of the child’s progress. 
- Certainly, staff should not be doggedly implementing a strategy that does not work, just because it is specified in the original IEP.

### Reviewing
- Reviews should actively involve the child and parents, as well as teachers and support staff. There are a range of different ways of organising reviews. It is usually best if any system developed fits in as far as possible with existing school structures
- There should be some written documentation, even if it is a scribbled, dated note on the original IEP which notes which targets have been achieved. This will be invaluable information for the following year when the IEP for the next academic year is being prepared. 
- In a formal review meeting key questions which need to be asked are: 
        * What progress has the child made? 
        * Which targets have been achieved?  
        * How successful were the strategies used? 
        * What are the next steps? 
        * Should alternative strategies be tried? 
        * Is a more detailed assessment needed? 
        * Is everyone clear about what has been agreed? 
        * Who will do what, by when?


# Recommendations for an IEP:

### Beware of paperwork:
- The author advises to beware of cumbersome systems, which involve a lot of paperwork. These usually collapse or else are sustained through teacher exhaustion but are neither helpful to teachers, nor useful to children. 

### High standard quality of dialogue:
- It is far more important that the quality of dialogue during a review meeting is of the highest standard, then that the written document is pristine. Some solutions; drafted targets can be written on slips of paper and, if agreed, can be pasted onto a blank document. 

### Do not reinvent the wheel. 
- Proformas for the IEP planning sheet and the IEP document itself can be gleaned from relevant sources. With time, most schools will probably develop their own system, with tailor made paperwork, but proformas are certainly a way to get started (two are included at the end of this article). 

### Start with small number of children:
- Introducing IEPs at first can be daunting, but getting started, even with a small number of students, is the key. It is hoped that this article is helpful in giving some encouragement and practical guidance.
