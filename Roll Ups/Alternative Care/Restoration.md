# The Need for Alternative Care Systems

# Legal and Policy Frameworks on Restoration
[^2]
According to a document that outlines the guidelines for reintegration of children to families, these guidelines are based on
* The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) (UN 1989);
*  The Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children, welcomed by the UN in 2009 (UN GA 2010); 
* Inter-agency Guiding Principles on Unaccompanied and Separated Children (ICRC, IRC, Save the Children, UNICEF, UNHCR and World Vision 2004); 
* The UN Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty (UN 1990); 
* The Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children (UN 2000);
*  Minimum Standards for Child Protection in Humanitarian Action (CPWG 2012).

# Restoration
* [^1] According to a care manual created by Prerna, **Definition: The process of reuniting a child with their family is known as restoration**
* The right of children to not be separated from one’s family and, if separated from one’s family for whatever reasons, then their right to be restored to their family has been articulated explicitly in recent laws and instruments. 
	* Unfortunately, there may be situations where the natural or extended families, and more appropriately natural parents and close natural relatives get separated from their child, or become incompetent, disinclined to provide care and protection to their child or become a source of harm to the child. In such cases, the responsibility to provide care and protection may fall on the State. This corrective measure is also called deinstitutionalization but the term describes only a part of the larger process of restoration.

# Identified Needs in Restoring Children

## Shelter
* Safety:
    * Ensuring the safety of a child victim is a challenging job in non-institutional settings like families. It is much easier to adhere to the legal guidelines of safety in formal institutional set-ups because they are well-funded, either run or monitored by the state authorities. 
    * Families on the other hand are independent units that may need assistance and support from time to time. As per the UN Guidelines for Alternative Care of Children, 2010, efforts need to focus on directing the child to remain or return to their parents, families, or guardians, when appropriate
    * A measure to assess and ensure the safety of CNCP is:
        * Social Investigation Report (SIR):
            * Typically, ‘found but untraced’ children or those whose rights seem to have been violated are produced before the CWC either by the Childline officials (a national child helpline service), police officials, or any ordinary citizen. 
            * Post the initial assessment, if the parents of the child are found, the CWC decides to place the child with the parents or guardians, until the inquiry is completed. If the parents or guardians cannot be traced, then, the child is temporarily placed in a CH, until the inquiry is completed. 
            * Often, during the period of inquiry, close relatives including the parents of the victim approach the CWC seeking the custody of the child. 
            * In such situations, it is critical to conduct a thorough assessment of the family, especially the parents, before restoring the child to them. This procedure of inquiry is called the Social Investigation and its report is called Social Investigation Report (SIR). 
            * The SIR needs to be completed within the 15 days of the CWC passing the Order, so that the CWC can pass a Final Order within four months of the first production of the child. 
            * The Social Investigation includes interacting with the child, the case worker (the CCI staff) assigned to the child, as well as the Investigating Officer (the police) and any other significant individuals such as the family and school in the case as the Committee deems relevant.
            * While the information collected and presented in the SIR is based on facts observed or recorded, there is some scope to add suggestions, recommendations, or pressing observations from the case workers
    * Care and Protection 
    * While safety has a more physical connotation of keeping the child safe, care and protection entails the socio-cultural elements of a child’s well-being.
    * Multiple aspects are covered under the care and protection, these are:
        * Immunity against re-trafficking
            * When victims are trafficked by known persons (known as acquaintances) into the sex trade, there is a possibility of the victim being sexually maltreated, intimidated, threatened, or trafficked yet again. 
            * In cases where the trafficker (or their family) is in close physical proximity to the child victim and their family, their vulnerability increases. Thus, restoring a child victim in such environments may not be safe. 
            * The child victim’s physical proximity to the trafficker needs to be assessed and considered while conducting the inquiry and making a decision for restoration
            * Case workers make the following assessments pre-restoration: 
                * Identifying the location and residence of the trafficker. 
                * Finding the current status of the trafficker or exploiter: If an offense has been registered and the trafficker is in jail, social workers follow up on the bail applications and keep the family apprised of the legal status of the case. 
                * Assessing the trafficker’s (if they have been released on bail) or their family’s (if the trafficker is in jail) behavior: There may be a possibility that the trafficker or their family may try to intimidate the victim’s family. All such relevant information is shared with the CWC to enable them to make an informed decision about the child’s care and protection. 
                * Assess the family’s capacity to manage and respond to a precipitating incident concerning the victim’s protection
            * Besides proximity to the trafficker, sometimes (especially in urban slum settlements), there might be disrupting instances and elements in the immediate social environment of the victim that might make them vulnerable to exploitation. 
            * These can include peer pressure to use or sell drugs, high incidences of sexual violence against women, poor or disintegrated social protection systems, or low vigilance by local administrators and law enforcement, etc. 
            * It is critical that a child is prepared for such social vulnerabilities during restoration.
        * Access to society and opportunities:
            * When the family is unaware of the crimes committed against their child and are made aware of the same, they might feel violated. 
            * The parents might question and re-examine their parenting style and yearn to provide a safe environment for their child. 
            * Thus, it is likely for the families to become vigilant of the child victim’s mobility and restrict their movement beyond the house and the immediate community. 
            * The stigma associated with sexual violence might also make the family overly cautious of the victim’s social interaction, including their presence online. 
            * This stigma can also make the family and victim feel distanced from their immediate social environment. These factors can adversely affect the child’s development.
            * It has been observed that a family’s over-cautious behavior can lead a child victim to internalize restrictions and confinement. To avoid the same, case workers interact with the child regularly and refer them to counselors to help them deal with their emotions.
            * Thus, following measures can be taken up by a caseworker as follow up conversations after the child is restored with the family:
                * Determine parents’ attitude towards the child’s routine movements in the community.
                * Understand the challenges of the child while moving outside their home
                * Family or parental counseling: In certain cases, the case workers may refer parents or the family for professional counseling to better equip them for creating a trustworthy environment for their child.
        * Adult supervision
            * The quality and presence of adult supervision, either parents or guardians, is critical to a child’s well-being. The absence of this supervision and guidance might result in an offense being (re)committed against the children. 
            * Thus, when a child is restored, it is essential to assess the nature of supervision available for them post-restoration.

## Health
### Nutrition
- Nutrition is a primary requirement for development. Children should have access to healthy, sumptuous, and nutritious food 3 to 4 times a day. The quantity of the meals depends on the child’s age and developmental stages of growth. 
    * When a child victim is in a CCI, the food and nutrition requirements are taken care of and monitored regularly as per the prescribed guidelines. 
    * However, once the child is restored to their family, the victim’s access to healthy and nutritious food needs to be assessed by the case workers through interaction and follow-ups with the family and the victim.
    * Follow-ups after restoration should focus on understanding the relevant family practices, gender, and other social biases about food and nutrition and its impact on the child’s overall growth and development.
