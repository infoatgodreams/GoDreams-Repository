# What puts children in institutions? 
* According to a massive meta analysis on institutionalisation[^6], 
	* Studies show that **80–90% of children residing in them have a living parent**. 
    * Poverty is often cited as the main reason for institutional placement, along with access to health care and education. However, the majority of poor families do not place their children in institutions, and more complex causes are involved, such as the **social marginalisation that can accompany childbearing outside of marriage**.
    * **Emergencies and disasters** can also lead to a child being placed in an institution
    * Child abuse within families is not cited as a common reason for placement in institutions in lower income countries, but is more so in higher income settings.


# How do we better gatekeeping entry into institutions?
According to a report on Alternative care, authored by Udayan Care [^9]
- Preventing separation of children from families
- Political commitment and accountability to keep children within families
- Assessment and documentation of the child and family situation in a multi-sectoral context
- Engagement with and empowerment of family members and community
- Regular review and complaint mechanism, reunification with family, wherever possible,
- High quality, accessible, and affordable, services for all, targeted and specialised for those in need
- Child budgeting, measuring the costs and social return of well-being of children
- Supporting transition of children successfully
- Placing children in alternative care in the best way possible 
- Monitoring all children in alternative care. 



# The Need for Alternative Care Systems
According to a massive meta-analysis on institutionalisation[^6], 

### Developmental concerns in institutionalised care
- The meta analysis found that residency in an institution is associated with substantial developmental delays and deviations
- Institutionalisation is strongly associated with delays in physical growth, brain development, cognitive development, and attention.
- The greatest effects on children were delayed physical growth (height and weight for age) and delayed brain and cognitive development, to the extent that in these developmental domains at least 80% of the institutionalised group are below the mean of the comparisons.
- The smaller effects on socioemotional development might also reflect children in institutions having learnt not to express emotion because of the oppressive and neglectful regimes under which these children often live.
- The largest delays for physical growth and for cognitive development emerge in infancy and early childhood up to age 42 months
- Effects appear to vary as a function of the type of institutional care—ie, its duration and quality—with the suggestion that children aged 6–24 months are especially susceptible to the effects of institutional care.
- In general, we suggest that the evidence presented here underestimates rather than overestimates the effect of institutionalisation and deinstitutionalisation on children’s development.
		* In particular, the commonly used instruments might not capture some of the unique effects of institutional care, and typical outcomes such as quasi-autism and indiscriminate social behaviours are often not systematically assessed.
		* Not all children are affected to the same extent, and which individual factors make them more or less susceptible to the negative effect of institutional care needs further investigation.

### Health concerns (Physical & Mental Health) in institutionalised care
- Studies assessing the children’s physical health within a year after leaving an institution showed substantial adverse effects 
	*- Of note, dental health was included as part of the measurement of physical health in some studies and was sometimes better in children in institutions than in their peers who had not lived in an institution.* (*counterintuitive*)
- Only a few children developed a secure attachment relationship with the closest caregiver within the institution.
- Attention problems tend to increase with age, possibly because executive attention generally develops later, so problems might be difficult to detect in early childhood.
- In terms of cognitive and socioemotional development and attention, boys had more delays than girls after growing up in institutions. Girls had more delays in physical health.
-  A recovery in children’s socioemotional problems after deinstitutionalisation seemed largely absent
- The English and Romanian Adoptees study found evidence for strong persistence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder through to early adulthood.


### Benefits of Deinstitutionalisation 
- Children show initial signs of rapid improvement following deinstitutionalisation.
    * Physical growth showed a catch-up after deinstitutionalisation 
    * Substantial recovery because of deinstitutionalisation was also found for brain growth as inferred by changes in head circumference and cognitive development
    * Accelerated development after exiting the institution might represent a short-term catchup at the expense of delayed development at a later developmental stage.
    * Children who have had extended deprivation can develop secure attachments with their new parents from adoption or foster placements, even after being exposed to severe deprivation.
    * Furthermore, in many of the domains that did show an intervention effect, children in foster care rarely did as well as children who had never been institutionalised.
    * Evidence of catch up or recovery following deinstitutionalisation has been shown, although many affected children do not show full catchup, especially children with extended deprivation.
    * Despite this, many children who have left institutions adapt reasonably well. Given the corroboration of observational results by data from the BEIP randomised controlled trial data, evidence for the causal benefits of deinstitutionalisation is quite strong


# What are existing alternative care systems? 
- According to Sneha Care[^5]
	The following explains the hierarchy of options available in alternative care
    * in the home of origin
    * followed by adoption
    * kinship foster care
    * long-term foster care in the home of a non-family member
    * care in an institution. 
    * “Permanency Planning” programmes – which aim to support families to care for children in their homes – have been introduced, “at least on a trial basis,” in almost every state
	* Small group homes which are argued to be more personal than large institutions and guardianship are included as “subalternatives.”

According to a paper on alternative care in India, these are the existing community-based care models in India:

## Guardianship 
- A guardian is a lawfully appointed adult representative for a child. The guardian’s role is to make sure that a child’s rights are upheld, and the child’s best interests are protected.
- The modalities of being a guardian may vary from region to region. Where formal guardian systems do not exist, alternative systems of care may be created by having a legally documented representative for the child. 
- The laws governing guardianship of children in India include the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, and The Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956. 

  ## Adoption 
  - Adoption is defined as the permanent placement of a child in a family, whereby the rights and responsibilities of the biological parents are legally transferred to the adoptive parent/s. 
  - The laws governing the adoption of children in India are the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, the Hague Convention on Inter-Country Adoption, 1993 (Ratified by the Government of India in 2003), the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, and the Adoption Regulations, 2017. 
  
  ### The Fundamental principles governing adoption:
	- The child’s best interests shall be of paramount consideration, while processing any adoption placement
	-  Preference shall be given to place the child in adoption with Indian citizens and with due regard to the principle of placement of the child in his own socio-cultural environment, as far as possible
	- All adoptions shall be registered on Child Adoption Resource Information and Guidance System and the confidentiality of the same shall be maintained by the Authority. 

  ### Challenges in adoption: 
  - Less children reaching adoption agencies.
  - Rules and guidelines are too strict
	- It is stated and also observed that the rules are rigid, the procedures are lengthy, and the state scenario is not always applicable. 
	- They have to register on the website as Prospective Adoptive Parents (PAPs) and wait for their chance. Besides, matching is also carried out by the Central Adoption Resource Agency (CARA) and not by the adoption agency concerned. 
	- Parents cannot physically pick the children, and the child's preference is often an issue again when done online. If the prospective parents are pleased with the child, a home study will be performed by the Specialist Adoption Agency (SAA) of the respective state and recommended for adoption.
	- Otherwise, the process must again start with the parents waiting for their opportunity and CARA matching the parent – child. This slows the process of adoption, meaning children have to live in institutional care for longer. 
	- The study also indicates that registered prospective parents waiting for their chance are so high compared to children who are adopted.
	-  Delays at various level in the adoption process 
- Differently able or girl child usually left out. 
	- The study also suggests that most prospective parents prefer a male boy, ideally be - tween 0 and 3 years of age. 
	- Children with different able or special needs are only adopted by foreigners and not within the state or country (which is also minimal)

## Foster Care

- Foster care is the temporary placement of a child with a family when their biological parents are unable to care for them. Foster care is formal care typically provided by unrelated adult/s. 
- This arrangement is for a specific time until the child can be reintegrated and reunified with their biological family. 
- Hence placement in foster care is not permanent in nature. Foster carers generally receive assistance to meet the child’s needs which may include training, guidance and financial assistance from the government.
- Foster care can be advantageous and may play an important role in a situation where a child’s own family demonstrated a temporary inability to care for the child. 
- The laws governing foster care in India are the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, and the Model Guidelines for Foster Care, 2016. 
- ICPS also strongly advocates family-based care of children and deals with procedures for sanction and release of funds under foster care programme, foster care fund and foster care approval committee

### Types of Foster Care 
- Short Term Foster Care - For not more than one year. Two foster children can live in a foster family, unless in the case of siblings which may be more than two in order to keep siblings together
- Long Term Foster Care - Exceeding one year or more and until the child reaches the age of 18 years. Two foster children can live in a foster family; unless in the case of siblings which may be more than two in order to keep siblings together.
- GFC - A family-like care in a fit facility for children in need of care and protection who are without parental care with the aim to provide personalised care and a sense of belonging and identity upto 18 years and maximum of eight children can live in a Group Foster Care home including the caretaker’s biological children.
	- All children are eligible for foster care as declared by CWC. The District Child Protection Unit (DCPU) is the nodal authority for implementing the foster care programme in a district and the CWC has been given the power to take

## Processes involved in foster care

- All decisions related to placement of a child in foster care are taken by CWC and DCPU. The law also sets up a Sponsorship and Foster Care Approval Committee (SFCAC) to review and sanction sponsorship and foster care fund. 
- Financial support of not less than INR 2,000 per month per child is available to foster parents and group foster care if requested and dully approved by SFCAC. 
- If both the spouses are Indian citizens or both are willing to foster the same child and both are 35 years and more and in good health, they can foster a child. Normally this foster family should have enough income with to meet the needs of the child. 
- The foster parents are also obliged to follow rules laid down including regular visits to doctors, maintenance of child health and their records and also attend foster care orientation programs organized by the DCPU.
- Not more than 4 children including their own children shall be placed in family foster care. 
- Siblings should preferably be placed together in a single family or same fit facility and where relevant and necessary, biological parents’ consent is required in foster care.
- For GFC (Group Foster Care)
	- the DCPU is responsible to identify Fit facility for GFC and register the organisation under the Act. The CWC has to recognize the organisation as a fit facility for placement of children in GFC. 
	- The organisation has to be also registered on the NITI Aayog website, it should have a child protection policy in place and have updated files of all medical reports of its caregivers. 
	- The accommodation should be sufficiently spacious for a group of eight children to reside and ensure privacy of children and the caregivers should not have any criminal conviction or indictment in the past.
	-  The law also stipulates that the GFC home should have the look and feel of a house providing a family environment, rather than an institutional setting and be located within an existing neighborhood to encourage local interaction and the organisation should be ready to attend pre service training provided by DCPU.
	-  It should have provident fund and retirement policy for caregivers

### Monitoring Foster Care
- The DCPU or an NGO or social worker identified by DCPU must
	- Visit foster families least once a week for the first month
	- Visit monthly for next six months
	- Visit bi-annually after 7 months
	- Create and maintain Individual Case Files for each child in foster care
	- Monthly visits to schools to ensure his education continues for a period of 1 year 

### Problems with foster care
- There is a general lack of awareness about foster care systems in the country. 
- Surprisingly, some institutional care settings are unaware of the policy and programme for keeping a child in foster care. 
- The institutional staff that are aware of the programme are also confused with whom to approach and avail the services as it is not effective. Therefore, the staff who prepare the individual care plan for each child do not select or recommend these methods for the rehabilitation and social integration of children because they do not function effectively.


## Kinship Care
- Kinship care is full time care of a child by a relative or member of the extended family (Bromfield and Osborn, 2007). This is an arrangement which is the most common form of alternative care worldwide. It is characteristically managed without formal legal intervention. In numerous developing nations, kinship is fundamentally the only form of alternative care available (UNICEF, 2006).
-  It offers many advantages over other forms of care since it permits family relationships to continue, keeps the children within their culture and community, and avoids the anxieties associated with the placement of children with unfamiliar adults and families.  

## Sponsorship 
- Sponsorship is providing of additional financial support to families who are unable to meet educational and other needs of their children, due to a number of reasons.
-  The assistance is towards meeting expenditures on medical, nutritional and educational and other needs of the child, allowing the child to continue and stay with their biological families. 
- Working with the family as a unit is a very effective approach in sponsorship. Eventually, families are trained to become self reliant and independent through long-term rehabilitation plans that is self-sustainable. 
- NIAC reflects the shift in childcare from the “Welfare” to the “Developmental” and from the “Needs” to the “Rights” and from “Institutional Care” to “Non-Institutional Alternative Care”. A collective and co-ordinated approach that focused on family and community based care for children and youth is a step in the right direction of child protection.
  

## Current push for deinstitutionalization 
* **UNICEF** has declared its support for programmes “including provision of information on the detrimental impact of institutional care on the young child, and education for parents of children with disabilities and parents at risk of abandoning their infants' ' to discourage the use of institutional care. 
* **Save The Children (STC)** encourages “[d]onors to ensure that funding is directed at preventive community and family support and at family-based alternative care.”
* “The new** international Guidelines** set out clear quality standards that should be met by all forms of alternative care. They are universal, based on the **UN Charter for the Rights of the Child (UNCRC,)** and apply to all settings regardless of their culture or financial and political status.”
* Amongst other things, these Guidelines set out to:
    * more effectively monitor existing institutions
    * provide better “gate-keeping”
    * restrict the use of institutional care especially for those under the age of three 
    * And importantly, place all of this within an overall strategy of deinstitutionalization.

# Legal and Policy Frameworks on Restoration
[^2]
According to a document that outlines the guidelines for reintegration of children to families, these guidelines are based on
* The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) (UN 1989);
*  The Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children, welcomed by the UN in 2009 (UN GA 2010); 
* Inter-agency Guiding Principles on Unaccompanied and Separated Children (ICRC, IRC, Save the Children, UNICEF, UNHCR and World Vision 2004); 
* The UN Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty (UN 1990); 
* The Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children (UN 2000);
*  Minimum Standards for Child Protection in Humanitarian Action (CPWG 2012).

# Restoration
* [^1] According to a care manual created by Prerna, **Definition: The process of reuniting a child with their family is known as restoration**
* The right of children to not be separated from one’s family and, if separated from one’s family for whatever reasons, then their right to be restored to their family has been articulated explicitly in recent laws and instruments. 
	* Unfortunately, there may be situations where the natural or extended families, and more appropriately natural parents and close natural relatives get separated from their child, or become incompetent, disinclined to provide care and protection to their child or become a source of harm to the child. In such cases, the responsibility to provide care and protection may fall on the State. This corrective measure is also called deinstitutionalization but the term describes only a part of the larger process of restoration.
* According to a document that outlines restoration guidelines, Family reintegration is what the majority of the separated children and their families want (BCN et al. 2013). 
	* These guidelines explores principles of good practice in children’s reintegration aimed primarily at child protection programme managers in low and lower-middleincome contexts. 
	* The guidelines cover reintegration back into families of origin and do not coverplacement into alternative care or new families through adoption or similar practices.
	* **Definition of Reintegration**: “The process of a separated child making what is anticipated to be a permanent transition back to his or her family and community (usually of origin), in order to receive protection and care and to find a sense of belonging and purpose in all spheres of life.”

## Why is reintegration/restoration so important? 
- According to a manual on the guidelines for institutional childcare in Ethiopia, reintegration is crucial in
	* preventing the various psycho-social problems that arise among children due to deprivation of familial care
	* facilitating conditions for the assimilation of children with their parents and/or members of extended family and promote their all rounded development
	* creating opportunities for children in which they can learn familial and social values and norms living with their parents and/or members of the extended family; and
	* supporting parents and/or members of extended families to re-assume their responsibility to cater for their children.

## Arguments against the push for deinstitutionalisation 
- Interestingly, Sneha Care Home has been against this binary pitting of institutional care against the “alternatives” of family and community-based care is the not-implicit assumption that the two are mutually exclusive, that one precludes the other: that institutions weaken familial and community ties, that funding institutional care drains resources from community-based initiatives.
	- ### Private Boarding versus Institutional care:
    * One – and arguably the only contention in defence of this apparent double standard is that conditions in boarding schools are better than those in institutional care and that the harm and neglect that is potentially experienced by children within institutional care does not extend to borders. Yet evidence supporting this contention is conspicuous by its absence
	    * Since there is little sound evidence to back up the claim that the boarding school system for the privileged is automatically and innately less harmful than institutional care for vulnerable children, perhaps the emphasis should be on the quality of care and education being provided to children in each rather than on where it is provided.
	* Impact of institutional care on family relationships:
	    * While it might be assumed that institutional placement would sever or weaken familial relations, evidence points to the positive effects that placing a family member in institutional care can have in terms of improving family ties and dynamics. In the case of the elderly, for example, it has been found that “nursing home placement leads to renewed or discovered closeness of familial bonds
	    * Demonstrating institutional care’s potential long-term benefits for family dynamics was a longitudinal study which interviewed the families of children with mental retardation who had received residential treatment both one and two years after placement.
	    * The study found that “respondents primarily reported post placement benefits to the family.” Crucially, however, the study also noted that in this particular case, family involvement in the children’s treatment programme while they were institutionalized was “high and stable.”
	    * Indeed, a renowned longitudinal study carried out in the 1960s – “The Cleveland Bellefaire follow-up study” – found that for children leaving institutions and returning to their families and communities, the gains accrued from institutional care tended to last longer if staff worked with parents and community agents for a transitional period once the child was discharged
	    * Lack of planned and nurtured contact between children in residential care and their families was found to be an almost universal phenomenon in the countries covered by Save the Children’s research. It is extremely rare to find any institution which positively values family contact
	* * Institutional care and family/community care as being mutually exclusive:
    * This “care continuum” is a continuum in the sense that it presents an array of care options which fall across a spectrum but not in the sense that children are encouraged to move along it – since the goal is increasingly that of “permanency”, and within a family setting
    * This view is problematic for a number of reasons:
        * To “return” to the past form of care, as some advocates of alternative care seem to be espousing, would be to return to a “mixed-economy of care” – and not, as they suggest, family-based care
        * The second reason that the “either-or” approach is problematic is that by presenting family or community-based care as “alternatives” to institutional care, proponents of this view miss the point that historically, long-term institutional care facilities have spearheaded a number of the key healthcare initiatives (particularly to do with community outreach) that are now being presented as “alternatives” to those very institutions
        * The “either-or” assumption dismisses or at the very least underplays any possibility of combining elements of institutional care and the alternatives provided. In a similar fashion, the suggestion made in this paper is that SCH, which is intricately connected with Karnataka’s Community Care Centres on multiple levels: from family tracing to information sharing, from outreach services to follow-up care, demonstrates the extent to which it is possible to combine the benefits of both institutional care and community-based alternatives while offsetting a number of the disadvantages of each.
* Family and community-based care as the universally best options
    * Even the staunchest advocates of family-based care appreciate that this is not always possible – either because the child has been orphaned or because some biological parents for medical or other reasons are unable to care for their child. This is particularly true for CLHA, who are likely to have lost their parents to AIDS or have parent(s) with seriously compromised health – parent(s) who may not have long to live. 
    * For this reason, foster care or adoption are typically presented as viable alternatives to institutional care for these children to be able to be brought up in an environment which is as home-like as possible.
    * Adoption and Foster care in India:
        * Most relevant to the present study, the striking absence of foster care across India has been noted. 
        * Various reasons for why foster care has proven difficult to implement in India have been cited – but they include 
            * the difficulties of identifying foster carers with “appropriate motivation and adequate housing” 
            * and “problems of ‘matching’ children and foster carers around issues of caste, religion, colour and language.”  
        * Interestingly, work on child care in Cape Town, has also pointed to the dearth of formal foster care or adoption amongst the Indian community compared to the African community during the apartheid era -suggesting that this resistance to foster care may not be transient .
        * With the stigma surrounding HIV/ AIDS being so strong that many infected children are actually (unofficially) prevented from attending school in their communities owing to the fear of fellow students’ parents, the prospect of being fostered or adopted is an even more distant one for Indian CLHA.
    * The problem with Kinship care:
        * Kinship-based care has been proposed as an alternative to institutional care for orphaned children or children whose parents are unable to care for them. 
        * Indeed, because it involves blood ties and therefore, it is assumed, is based on a sense of familial loyalty and genuine affection, it is often presented as the preferred alternative over formal, non-kinship-based foster care or adoption
        * Yet this assumption can lead to a number of dangers. 
            * Evidence has been cited that it leads to less monitoring than formal fostering. For example, at SCH, one staff member recounted the case of one girl, formerly under the institution’s care, who was sold into sex slavery by her uncle. 
        * By appealing to our sense of family as a safe haven, kinship care appears innocuous, but, as this girl’s experience demonstrates, that is clearly not always the case  
        * As extended families are broken up, and as **financial pressures **make it difficult for people to sustain even their own nuclear families, one must question the extent to which even the most well-meaning extended kin can cope with the burden of taking in a niece, nephew or grandchild with multiple needs such as CLHA that may require even more financial and emotional investment than a healthy child.
        * For children with their kins working in agriculture and other daily wage work, kinship care would mean living in a mostly empty house, until aunts and uncles return home from a hard day’s work. 
        * The **current indian government scheme,** which gives 700 rupees a month to those caring for CLHA in their homes, can hardly be seen as an effective solution – since in the overwhelming majority of cases, the children’s extended kin are struggling even as the financial burden of caring for the ill child is carried completely by SCH.
        * Problems with grandparent care for vulnerable children: 
            * In ‘From Roots to Roots’, Tolfree reports research in Uganda which “found that behavioural problems were common in grandparent-headed households.” The study found that children who had a grandparent in their fifties and sixties as a caretaker were “vulnerable to malnutrition and infectious diseases because food production was low and medical care could not be afforded.
            * A US-based study “found that custodial grandparents have a 50% higher chance of having a daily activity limitation. They report lower satisfaction with their own health and rate their health status lower than do non-custodial grandparents
            * SCH runs an outreach programme in Kolar in collaboration with ‘Sisters of Precious Blood’ – a faith-based Community Care Centre. One nurse working in the outreach programme explained to this author that ART adherence is often more challenging when it comes to CLHA living in grandparent-headed households. The tendency for grandparents to forget, or to insist on giving children herbal medicines which interfere with the ART medication is a serious concern which she says she and the other staff members at ‘Sisters of Precious Blood’ often find themselves battling with.
* Community-based care and institutional care cater for the same populations:
    * Community-based organisations and social welfare agencies are seen as being able to provide support to the families (biological or otherwise) of vulnerable children while keeping the latter out of institutions. 
    * Yet here too, assuming that the “alternative” of community care targets the same populations that would otherwise have resided in institutions is problematic 
    * Social service “Creaming”:
        * The problem of “creaming” in social services remains a glaring one. As Schuerman has noted, “many programs appear to favour the acceptance of''better `` or''easier `` cases, cases that are relatively less needy.”
        * Targeted Intervention programs in India:
            * In the case of India, a look at how Targeted Intervention programs (TIs) for PLHA have fared is instructive. TIs have been one of the main mechanisms for reducing transmission of HIV across India under the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP-II). 
            * Statistics indicate that 2008 saw a significant decline in transmission rates amongst female sex workers in high HIV prevalence southern districts as compared to 2001 in places where TIs were intense. Yet a 2007 parliamentary committee report reveals that this is only part of the picture. 
            * As of 2007, 45% of sex workers, 47% of injecting drug users and a staggering 94% of men who have sex with men – all considered “target” vulnerable populations – had not received any intervention.
            *  Moreover, the committee noted that the Department of Health presented no figures for the Male Sex Worker population, suggesting that they either “do not have the figures of estimated coverage or they are simply not covered at all.” 
        * The idea that the acutely vulnerable can be equally and even better served by targeted social policies is challenged by these findings.
    * Weakened pubic voice:
        * One of the serious consequences of dismantling these kinds of pioneering institutions is the resulting fragmentation of vulnerable populations from a public voice point of view.
        * It has often been commented that one of the injustices of a democratic society is that even as it purports to provide everyone with a voice, it is repeatedly those most capable of organizing themselves effectively that are heard. 
        * The cruel irony being that those encountering serious barriers to that kind of organization (economic, educational, health related etc) – are likely to be those whose needs are most urgent 
    * Experience has shown that in a number of cases, the two cater for different types of populations – with those in institutional care typically exhibiting a plethora of problems that make their stay in a facility which can address those multiple needs the best option for them. 
    * The fact that community-based care and care in an institutional setting tend to target different populations makes the promotion of one over the other deeply problematic.
* Family (re)integration and community (re)integration as unproblematic concepts:
    * This is an important point since in almost all cases the stated goal of the “alternatives” agenda is that of “family reintegration” for the institutionalized whose biological families are alive or “family integration” for those put up for adoption, or who are entered into foster or kinship care. 
    * Community integration or reintegration is seen as flowing automatically once children are transferred from an institution to a family setting.
    * The documents appear to present the goals of family integration and successful community integration as synonymous. This is despite the worrying findings that a sizable number of children who are placed in foster care “age out” in the system and enter society woefully ill equipped for successful “community integration.”
    * The point is not to argue that institutional care prepares children for independent living while the proposed “alternatives” do not. Instead it is to say that the rigid goal of “family integration at all costs” does not ensure successful community integration and may in some cases positively discourage it. 
    * That is if “community integration” is understood to be an independent adult with the skills to build a life for him or herself wherever he or she chooses rather than simply being physically part of a community. 
    * Father Mathew at SCH points out that this apparent disjuncture between child and youth policy is particularly worrying in light of recent reports on the unemployability of the vast majority of Indian youth
    * Future-oriented policy and programs:
        * Whilst it has rightly been argued that child policy which sees the child as an ‘adult in waiting’ more than a ‘child in the here and now’ creates its own problems,53 few would deny the serious costs to both children and society – of creating short-sighted child policies – particularly for vulnerable children.
        * In an individual interview for the present study, father mathew described his long-term vision of establishing a mentorship programme, where individual donors who sponsor children’s material care while at SCH become a source of emotional, social and professional support throughout the child’s stay in the institutional setting as well as following discharge. The other goal is an alumni network of past SCH beneficiaries who, once discharged, may find it helpful to reach out to one another for various forms of support – much like university graduates entering a new phase of their lives.
        * **SCH’s “sibling programme**”, which was being discussed and planned at the time of this paper’s writing, is also considered key to this future-oriented approach. Fr Mathew maintains that linking the children at SCH to negative elder siblings – who are highly likely to outlive their parents – is one crucial way of ensuring some kind of long-term support for these children once they are discharged
    *  According to a massive meta-analysis on the comparison of institutionalisation and deinstitutionalisation, we rarely look at Preinstitutional context
	    * This preinstitutional exposure to risks represents a substantial confounder in estimates of the effects of subsequent exposures.
	    * These preinstitutional risks include prenatal and postnatal exposures and events, although postnatal effects can be ruled out in many studies because children enter institutions soon after birth.
	    * However, data on these factors are rarely available or controlled for in studies of the subsequent effects of institutional care on development.
	    * * Institutional quality is affected by structural staffing differences and care practices. A meta­analysis of the effects of these factors was not possible because only a few studies provided relevant systematic measurement.
    * However, a qualitative review supports an association between care quality or extent of deprivation and developmental outcomes.
    * Negative developmental outcomes might be less common in children who had higher quality care.
    * The link between care quality and outcomes is shown by a quasi­experiment by the St Petersburg–USA Orphanage Research Team.
    * The investigators directly compared outcomes of young children in three Russian baby homes in which these structural staffing changes and caregiver training were manipulated in a quasi­experimental design.
    * The intervention showed that care that is more stable and supportive enhances children’s physical, cognitive, and socioemotional development, both while the children are in institutional care and when they are adopted into families.
    * Strikingly, growth benefits were observed without any change in diet.
    * Both retrospective and prospective studies have indicated that being a favourite child or having a preferred attachment figure in an institution is associated with less indiscriminate social behaviour.
    * Subnutrition (defined as a bodyweight of 1·5 SDs below the expected norm) in institutions has been studied indirectly by using weight at the time of removal from institutions as an index.
    * For example, in the English and Romanian Adoptee study, even among infants with less than 6 months of exposure to deprivation, subnutrition was associated with head circumferences that were nearly 3 SDs below the mean at age 6 years.
    * Infants with no subnutrition who left institutions before the age of 6 months showed no significant reduction in head growth. 
* Postinstitutional influences: Parent and family resources
    * The degree and rate of recovery after deinstitutionalisation and the ultimate level of functioning that children have might be affected by characteristics of the receiving families.
    * As in many aspects of child development, the education of the parents and the family income and access to resources might have an important role, with maternal education, family income, and the stability of the family structure predicting educational outcomes.
    * However, unrealistic expectations for achievement in families of high social status might undermine their adoptive children’s self­confidence and negatively affect the mental health of these children.1
* Postinstitutional influences: Quality of postinstitutional care
    * The type of postinstitutional placement might also affect children’s socioemotional and cognitive development.
    * For example, in the BEIP, investigators compared one group of children living in BEIP­sponsored foster families who had benefited from specialised training and support with another group of children placed with government­sponsored foster parents who came forward as part of child protection reform efforts.
    * After controlling for duration of time spent in foster care, children in the BEIP foster group at 54 months of age had fewer symptoms of attention­deficit hyperactivity disorder and, in girls only, fewer symptoms of internalising problems.1
* Postinstitutional influences: Individual differences in parenting
    * Children adopted internationally often become an ethnic or racial minority in another culture with two parents from the majority racial and ethnic group.
    * Among adolescent adoptees, more positive engagement in the family and higher amounts of maternal control were associated with the family acknowledging the importance of racial and ethnic differences and constructing a multiracial or multiethnic family identity.
    * Aspects of parenting quality also influence outcomes for deinstitutionalised children.
    * the use of mental state language by parents predicts the development of emotional understanding in children who have been deinstitutionalised.
* Child-related factors: Genetic factors
    * Several studies of candidate genes for specific disorders have shown that genetic variations might affect the susceptibility of a child to both negative effects of institutional care and positive responses to placement in a supportive family.
    * For example, children living in institutions who have the short allele of the 5-HTT gene (SLC6A4; index of a broader genetic pathway leading to susceptibility to the effects of environmental exposures) are more likely than children without this allele to show emotional problems generally,124 and socially indiscriminate behaviour specifically.
* Child-related factors: Child characteristics
    * The developmental status of a child at the time of their placement in a family after institutional care might influence the recovery trajectory of that child.
    * Few studies have tried to quantify the extent to which individual variations in characteristics at the time of placement in a family determine medium­term to long­term outcomes.
    * A relationship has been found between physiological dysregulation linked to the effects of institutional care and functioning after removal from the institution.



# Key principles governing restoration interventions
According to a guideline document on global restoration practices, we need to keep these principles in mind while designing an effective reintegration policy. 

## Prioritise family unity and be child-centred
* It is vital to recognise the central importance of family unity to child well-being and development and to actively explore reintegration with a child’s family of origin as the first priority to pursue. 
* Familiesand children must be at the centre of all reintegration support efforts the value of family unity is acknowledged in international law, including the UNCRC
* All decisions concerning alternative care should take full account of the desirability, in principle, of maintaining the child as close as possible to his/her habitual place of residence, in order to facilitate contact and potential reintegration with his/her family and to minimize disruption of his/her educational, cultural and social life. 
- Siblings with existing bonds should in principle not be separated by placements in alternative care unless there is a clear risk of abuse or other justification in the best interests of the child. In any case, every effort should be made to enable siblings to maintain contact with each other, unless this is against their wishes or interests.

## Embed reintegration in wider child protection systems
* Safe and effective support for reintegration must be embedded within broader systems to protect children. 
* There should be adequate funding to support reintegration, clear legislation and guidance on all of the stages of the reintegration process, and a skilled child welfare workforce able to support it.
* Agencies should work towards properly functioning child protection systems that can adequately support the reintegration of all groups of separated children.

### Effective child protection systems include the following components 
* National legislation and guidance: governments should work to develop and integrate policies.In cases where appropriate legislation and guidance does not exist, civil society has an advocacy role to play.
*  A competent child welfare workforce: a mix of professional personnel, para professionals, and community volunteers Efforts should be made to encourage staff retention, thus enabling ongoing relationships with children and families.
* Adequate resource allocations and fiscal management: Budgets should reflect all of the costs associated with reintegrating children If funds are insufficient, organisations are encouraged to advocate for more funding and proactively consider how to meet the needs of the child until reintegration is complete, even if external funds falter, as it is dangerous to reintegrate a child without adequate follow-up support and monitoring.
* Service provision and case work individual work with children and families and an array of services.
* The engagement of a range of actors: Governments have overall responsibility for coordinating reintegration efforts, allocating adequate funding to reintegration and ensuring that efforts are properly monitored. NGOs, community groups, families and children themselves also play key roles.
* Collaboration with other systems: it is important to design and implement programmes in collaboration with actors in other sectors – such as education, social protection, justice, economic strengthening, law enforcement and health.
* Supportive social norms
* Monitoring and data collection: the absence of a well-funded and functioning child protection system should not be used an excuse for failing to effectively support the reintegration of children.

### To support effective reintegration, the  staff will need to be able to do the following
* Acknowledge diversity.
* Develop a warm, though professional relationship with the child: Trust and continuity are vital for forming this relationship.
* Recognise the challenges that children and families face in the reintegration process.
* Help children to speak out, particularly in contexts where it may be dangerous to speak out publicly, staff have a responsibility to create a safe and confidential space.
* Identify and build on strengths: Help children, families and communities to identify their own human and financial resources, and develop a strategy to build on them.
* Create local ownership: community engagement is particularly important in addressing this stigma.
* Act in a culturally knowledgeable way: It is important to identify solutions that leverage local methods of care and protection.

## Take a rights-based approach
* All efforts to promote safe and effective reintegration must be based on a consideration of the full range of rights included in the UNCRC, and relevant national laws.
* They have a right to participate in all decisions that affect them, and decisions regarding their reintegration should be made with their best interests as a primary consideration.
* Article 9 states children should not be separated from their parents unless it is in their best interests.
* The UNCRC includes four core principles which all apply to reintegration efforts
* Children’s rights are indivisible and interdependent, with no one right taking precedence over another.
* As one of the first steps, all efforts should be taken to clarify any legal issues relating to the identity and documentation of the child and his or her family; that said, under the UNCRC, all children in a territory – no matter what their status – are eligible for the protection of that State and its officers, including reintegration services, whether or not they have been legally documented.

## Do no harm
* All reunification and interventions that support reintegration should aim to benefit and not harm children.
* Agencies should carry out a full risk assessment to determine the harm that could be caused by reintegration interventions and to identify steps to mitigate risk to children, families and staff. These steps should include developing a safety plan with children so that they know who to contact if they face harm once reintegrated or if reintegration breaks down. 
* Efforts should be made to put in place proper mechanisms for safeguarding children from abuse or violence through organisational child protection policies and procedures to reduce the risk of staff or other stakeholders abusing children at any stage in the reintegration process.
* Throughout the process, informed consent ensures that individual children and families understand and agree to reintegration strategies and support.
* Steps must be put in place to store records in a way that maintains confidentiality. Agencies must carefully consider what information should be shared with the family and the child.

## Engage a range of stakeholders
* It is vital to involve a range of stakeholders in the reintegration process including children, families, communities, schools, the media, government actors, non-governmental organisations and the private sector. 
* Mapping and coordinating reintegration and related services is important for effective collaboration. 
* Agencies are strongly encouraged to collaborate to ensure that all of the child’s needs are covered. This involves:
* holding regular meetings to coordinate sharing of programme information and referral protocols, as well as system-wide monitoring and evaluation.
* finding effective and ethical ways to share case information, and considering joint programming initiatives.


# Identified Needs in Restoring Children

## Shelter
* Safety:
    * Ensuring the safety of a child victim is a challenging job in non-institutional settings like families. It is much easier to adhere to the legal guidelines of safety in formal institutional set-ups because they are well-funded, either run or monitored by the state authorities. 
    * Families on the other hand are independent units that may need assistance and support from time to time. As per the UN Guidelines for Alternative Care of Children, 2010, efforts need to focus on directing the child to remain or return to their parents, families, or guardians, when appropriate
    * A measure to assess and ensure the safety of CNCP is:
        * Social Investigation Report (SIR):
            * Typically, ‘found but untraced’ children or those whose rights seem to have been violated are produced before the CWC either by the Childline officials (a national child helpline service), police officials, or any ordinary citizen. 
            * Post the initial assessment, if the parents of the child are found, the CWC decides to place the child with the parents or guardians, until the inquiry is completed. If the parents or guardians cannot be traced, then, the child is temporarily placed in a CH, until the inquiry is completed. 
            * Often, during the period of inquiry, close relatives including the parents of the victim approach the CWC seeking the custody of the child. 
            * In such situations, it is critical to conduct a thorough assessment of the family, especially the parents, before restoring the child to them. This procedure of inquiry is called the Social Investigation and its report is called Social Investigation Report (SIR). 
            * The SIR needs to be completed within the 15 days of the CWC passing the Order, so that the CWC can pass a Final Order within four months of the first production of the child. 
            * The Social Investigation includes interacting with the child, the case worker (the CCI staff) assigned to the child, as well as the Investigating Officer (the police) and any other significant individuals such as the family and school in the case as the Committee deems relevant.
            * While the information collected and presented in the SIR is based on facts observed or recorded, there is some scope to add suggestions, recommendations, or pressing observations from the case workers
    * Care and Protection 
    * While safety has a more physical connotation of keeping the child safe, care and protection entails the socio-cultural elements of a child’s well-being.
    * Multiple aspects are covered under the care and protection, these are:
        * Immunity against re-trafficking
            * When victims are trafficked by known persons (known as acquaintances) into the sex trade, there is a possibility of the victim being sexually maltreated, intimidated, threatened, or trafficked yet again. 
            * In cases where the trafficker (or their family) is in close physical proximity to the child victim and their family, their vulnerability increases. Thus, restoring a child victim in such environments may not be safe. 
            * The child victim’s physical proximity to the trafficker needs to be assessed and considered while conducting the inquiry and making a decision for restoration
            * Case workers make the following assessments pre-restoration: 
                * Identifying the location and residence of the trafficker. 
                * Finding the current status of the trafficker or exploiter: If an offense has been registered and the trafficker is in jail, social workers follow up on the bail applications and keep the family apprised of the legal status of the case. 
                * Assessing the trafficker’s (if they have been released on bail) or their family’s (if the trafficker is in jail) behavior: There may be a possibility that the trafficker or their family may try to intimidate the victim’s family. All such relevant information is shared with the CWC to enable them to make an informed decision about the child’s care and protection. 
                * Assess the family’s capacity to manage and respond to a precipitating incident concerning the victim’s protection
            * Besides proximity to the trafficker, sometimes (especially in urban slum settlements), there might be disrupting instances and elements in the immediate social environment of the victim that might make them vulnerable to exploitation. 
            * These can include peer pressure to use or sell drugs, high incidences of sexual violence against women, poor or disintegrated social protection systems, or low vigilance by local administrators and law enforcement, etc. 
            * It is critical that a child is prepared for such social vulnerabilities during restoration.
        * Access to society and opportunities:
            * When the family is unaware of the crimes committed against their child and are made aware of the same, they might feel violated. 
            * The parents might question and re-examine their parenting style and yearn to provide a safe environment for their child. 
            * Thus, it is likely for the families to become vigilant of the child victim’s mobility and restrict their movement beyond the house and the immediate community. 
            * The stigma associated with sexual violence might also make the family overly cautious of the victim’s social interaction, including their presence online. 
            * This stigma can also make the family and victim feel distanced from their immediate social environment. These factors can adversely affect the child’s development.
            * It has been observed that a family’s over-cautious behavior can lead a child victim to internalize restrictions and confinement. To avoid the same, case workers interact with the child regularly and refer them to counselors to help them deal with their emotions.
            * Thus, following measures can be taken up by a caseworker as follow up conversations after the child is restored with the family:
                * Determine parents’ attitude towards the child’s routine movements in the community.
                * Understand the challenges of the child while moving outside their home
                * Family or parental counseling: In certain cases, the case workers may refer parents or the family for professional counseling to better equip them for creating a trustworthy environment for their child.
        * Adult supervision
            * The quality and presence of adult supervision, either parents or guardians, is critical to a child’s well-being. The absence of this supervision and guidance might result in an offense being (re)committed against the children. 
            * Thus, when a child is restored, it is essential to assess the nature of supervision available for them post-restoration.

## Health
### Nutrition
- Nutrition is a primary requirement for development. Children should have access to healthy, sumptuous, and nutritious food 3 to 4 times a day. The quantity of the meals depends on the child’s age and developmental stages of growth. 
    * When a child victim is in a CCI, the food and nutrition requirements are taken care of and monitored regularly as per the prescribed guidelines. 
    * However, once the child is restored to their family, the victim’s access to healthy and nutritious food needs to be assessed by the case workers through interaction and follow-ups with the family and the victim.
    * Follow-ups after restoration should focus on understanding the relevant family practices, gender, and other social biases about food and nutrition and its impact on the child’s overall growth and development.

# The stages in the reintegration process

The following systems and processes are outlined in a document that clearly explains the global guidelines for restoration projects. 

## Tracing, assessment and planning

### Assessment of the child

* An individual assessment should be carried out with each child to identify their specific needs which are likely to vary by factors such as age, gender and experience whilst separated.
* It can be useful to develop context specific criteria for assessment which examine factors that may affect the reintegration of specific groups of children and this should be done in full consultation with children and families.

### Family tracing and Best Interests Determination
* In both emergency and non-emergency settings, it is often necessary to carry out extensive work to trace a child’s family. This tracing should take place after the initial assessment of the child, and may include identifying and tracing family members in different areas or even countries who could take care of the child.
    * Trace and locate the biological parent/s; or
    * Trace and locate member/s of the extended family where biological parent/s are untraceable
    * Confirming the willingness of the parent/s and/or member/s of the extended family
    * As discussed in a paper that outlines alternatives to institutional care[^4],  Assessments should place priority on cases where preservation or reunification is likely to happen rapidly, putting more resources in these cases (Kelley, 2000).
* it is always valuable to properly assess the best interests of the child, BID tools can be useful in the assessment process.
* Details of good practice in the assessment of the child
* Ensure the well-being of each child is quickly assessed by trained staff.
* Build trust between the child and a case worker.
* Evaluate the child’s present environment
* Consider all areas of the child’s well-being and the resources needed for successful reintegration
* Carefully consider if children should be involved in legal proceedings against their exploiters/abusers.
* Include a range of perspectives in the assessment of the child.

### Assessment of the family

* Once parents or other family members have been traced, an assessment of the family should occur.
* A basic model includes a preliminary assessment of:
	* risk factors that affect the safety and well-being of the child and changes that need to be made;
	* family strengths and resilience, including those of siblings;
	* family members’ perception of the reasons for separation and other problems;
	* the family’s level of readiness/capacity for change;
	* the family’s ability to care for the child;
	* the family’s economic situation.

### Assessment of the community

* It is important to assess their capacity to support children and families, and to challenge any stigma and discrimination they may face. Risks in the wider community should also be assessed.

## Developing a plan
* An individualised plan sets out a strategy for addressing the child’s and family’s needs and maximising their strengths, as identified in the assessment.
* Plans should also:
	* be shared with all family members and acknowledged by signature or a similar sign;
	* identify resources that the family can draw on, such as services or support in the community;
	* set specific, measurable, time-bound objectives, which can be used a tool for checking progress,
	* including prior to case closure;
	* cover all important areas of well-being and the indicators to assess them;
	* be developed with the child’s safety and confidentiality in mind; and
	* contain a contingency plan/ information about who children and family members should contact if the plan goes wrong and relationships breakdown.
	* Where possible, especially where dynamics are complex, it is recommended that a meeting is organised involving the child and family members. This may be done through family conferencing (see Box 6 below) where children and family members come together to develop a plan for the child with the facilitation of professionals.
* Global guidance on case management suggests plans should be reviewed at least every three months (CPWG 2014 and UN GA 2010).
* Helping the family to develop the plan themselves and take more ownership of their future is valuable (e.g. by providing ‘partial support’, where the family pays a proportion of a particular expense and the organisation pays the remainder).
* Case planning should include a consideration of the legal guardianship of the child and the point at which this will need to be handed back to the family (and to whom within the family).

## Preparation of children and families

## Ensuring a caring environment pre-reintegration

* Throughout the preparatory stage, it is important to consider the environment in which the child is living. In many cases, it will be necessary to remove children from situations of immediate harm and place them in some form of alternative care whilst they await reintegration.
* In line with global guidance, where possible, alternatives should be sought to large-scale institutions, including dormitory style transit centres.
* Children should remain in alternative care for as long as is needed to prepare them for reintegration or, where this is not possible, to find them a new permanent family.
* Considerations in providing alternative care for children whilst awaiting reintegration
* Enable children to mix with local communities and not become isolated.
* Balance meeting children’s basic needs with creating culturally appropriate conditions.
* Engage children in culturally appropriate daily responsibilities and decisions, such as cooking and cleaning, determining recreational activities or having some input in the daily schedule.
* Speak openly of the shared goal of family reintegration.
* Locate foster care placements and transit centres as close to home as possible.
* Develop conflict resolution mechanisms.
* Develop children’s capacity to act autonomously.
* Provide opportunities to express emotions safely.
* Create an atmosphere for healing and rehabilitation.

## Tackling discrimination and issues of identity

* Many reintegrating boys and girls are discriminated against because of their life during separation, such as their association with armed forces or a criminal group, exposure to sexual abuse or exploitation, pregnancy out of marriage, or exploitative forms of work. They may also experience discrimination due to gender, disability, HIV status, caste, ethnicity, sexual orientation or other status. Tackling this discrimination as far as possible before they return home is vital to ensure their successful reintegration.
* Staff may need to mediate between the child and family and/or community members, helping them express their feelings and accept changes in the child.
* While children should not be expected to return to being exactly as they were prior to the separation, if reintegration is to be successful, a child needs to recognise that his/her previous role and ‘identity’ may have to change.
* Helping a child re-learn his or her culture, dialect and religion10 is important, though this may well take longer than just the preparatory stage.

## Addressing abuse, neglect, violence and exploitation in the family

* Abuse, neglect, violence and exploitation within the family are extremely common reasons for children leaving home. With intensive effort, it is often possible to tackle these issues, allowing the child to return safely to the family. giving consideration to removing the abuser from the home if necessary.
* Ensuring that systems are in place to regularly monitor and support the child and family following reintegration,
* The use of evidence-based and culturally appropriate therapeutic approaches for children or other family members experiencing significant distress
* Referrals to medical services if needed.

## Meeting mental and physical health needs, responding to addiction

* Meeting the range of health needs of the child or caregivers/parents during the preparatory phase includes:
	* ongoing treatment of any health concerns, including addictions;
	* training staff to recognise emotional and psychological distress, and to take mental well-being seriously,
	* with referrals to appropriately trained professionals as necessary;
	* an assessment of the extent to which mental and physical health challenges can be met by the family and community after reunification, and ensuring that support is in place to respond to health needs.
- According to Ethiopian guidelines[^3], 
	- Offer counselling to the child to avoid possible adjustment problems
    * Offer prophylactic psychological, economic and legal advice and counselling to the family creating awareness as to the nature and rationale of child-family reunification to avoid any possible post-reunification adjustment problems
    * Provide medical check-up and treatment for the child
    * Facilitate for a child to visit the parent/s or member/s of extended family before reunification; and
    * Make ready materials such as bed, blanket, bed-sheets, etc. when necessary.


## Supporting children with disabilities

* During the preparatory phase, it is important to properly assess children with disabilities using a qualified expert and to work to rehabilitate children as appropriate
* In general, the focus should be on making the environment accessible and inclusive, not on trying to ‘fix’ children with disabilities to make them fit into society.
* When raising the possibility of reintegration, staff are advised to discuss openly any concerns with children and families, and to stress the agency’s commitment to continue to support access to rehabilitation services, medical treatment (if needed) or other required services once home.

## Planning for education and life skills training

* Quality, safe schooling can be used to help children learn necessary life skills, and teachers can help to keep an eye on at-risk children, making referrals where necessary. Efforts to ensure that children have access to school must start during the preparatory phase.
* Children, families and case workers will need to consider if it is viable to return children to settings where there is no access to schooling or if other alternatives should be sought (such as encouraging the family to move closer to schools, or placement with relatives during the academic year).

## Household economic strengthening and material support

* it is fundamentally important to understand the role that poverty may have played in any case of separation and to address it appropriately and effectively.
* Effective economic strengthening measures can reduce both poverty and stress within a family. During the preparatory phase, it is important to take the following measures.
* Use information from the family assessment to determine the livelihood security of the household.
* Ensure that economic interventions are tailored to the household’s capacities and the economic context.
* If market-based household economic strengthening is needed, seek relevant technical expertise.
* If new economic-strengthening initiatives are needed, seek reliable partners that have enabled poor families to achieve sustained economic self-support.
* If an appropriate partner cannot be found, managers will need to consider implementing their own economic-strengthening programmes; this may entail bringing in specialised staff or consultants.
* In addition to economic strengthening, other forms of material support, such as new beds or housing repairs, may be offered to families based on the need to help ease the child’s transition back into the household.
* For reasons of social harmony, economic-strengthening programmes must proactively strive to balance the needs of families with returnee children and those of impoverished families more generally.

## Determining who will carry out monitoring and follow-up support

* In order to ensure a smooth and continuous transition, it is important to establish prior to reunification who will monitor the returning child: an agency case worker, another worker (e.g. teacher, government social worker, community organisation), community volunteer, religious leader, etc.
* In general, it is a good idea for the case worker to make periodic visits that decrease in frequency over time, and for others actually living or working in the community of origin to act as closer observers, with a clear point of contact in case problems arise
3. Child’s initial contact with family and reunification

## Initial contact with families

* The process of reintroducing the child to the family and community should unfold gradually, according to each child’s individual needs, and should not be rushed.
* Possible steps to facilitate initial contact with families
* Enable remote contact through a letter/email, call, or video message:
* Short face-to-face meetings between parents/carers and child: Where feasible, the parent should travel to the child, which provides a clear indication of the parent’s commitment to reintegration, even though the agency may fund the travel. In some cases, such visits are unsafe and a neutral location is better, e.g. if the child was abducted and it is not yet safe to reveal his or her location.
* Longer, supervised visits at the parents’/carers’ home.
* Longer, unsupervised visits at the parents’/carers’ home: This type of meeting is only performed after a supervised visit has been successful.
* Throughout this phase, it is important that agencies ensure that contact has been re-established with other siblings who may not be living with the parents and may, for example, be in institutional care separately from the reintegrating child.
* Using the law to force parents or other caregivers to accept a child for reunification is never recommended.
* If the parents/caregivers or child refuse reunification, the case worker should revisit the contingency component of the plan. If that provides no appropriate option, then children will need to be kept or placed in alternative care and then, if reintegration is either not possible or appropriate, found a new permanent family through, for example, adoption or kafalah.

## Family reunification

* Reunification is the step that passes care and/or formal guardianship of the child back to his or her parents or traditional caregiver. Since this event is emotionally challenging for children, it is recommended that they be given as much control over it as possible: choosing the case worker to accompany them, choosing what to wear, etc.
* Possible steps in the family reunification process
	* Transfer of care back to family: As far as possible, parents/caregivers should state in writing their willingness to resume responsibility for the child and that they understand the implications of this.
	* Case transfer: It is recommended that (where possible) the case worker accompanies the child to meet the individual who will take over the case, reviews the paperwork with them, and involves local officials.
	* Reunification package and enrolment in services, including formal education: When access to the new community has been limited, the point of reunification becomes the opportunity to finalise arrangements of new services, e.g. enrolment with the local school, nursery or health service providers.
	* Acknowledgement of transition: 
		* The family and/or community who have been preparing for the child’s return may want to acknowledge it in a public fashion through, for example, speeches or a more elaborate welcoming/transition ceremony.
	- Post-reunification support
		* It is essential that agencies carefully monitor children on their return to families.
		* Follow-up support is as important as the work done during the preparatory stage.

## Monitoring child well-being

* It is vital that each child’s safety and well-being is monitored carefully after reunification.
* Monitoring may involve phone calls with the child, family or service providers, but should also include face-to-face visits. 
* It is recommended that an inter-agency protocol sets out benchmarks for the level and types of contact and support that each child should have following reunification. It is then important to monitor each child’s safety and well-being to determine benchmarks are being routinely met and whether additional action is required.
* During the follow-up phase, the case worker should speak with the child, parents, siblings, other relevant relatives and individuals who have a role to play in the child’s welfare (e.g. teachers, child protection committee members, religious leaders). 
* They must look out for signs of abuse or neglect Agencies must ensure that the child or someone he or she trusts has a way to contact the case worker and an emergency plan if immediate intervention is necessary.

## Follow-up support

* Staff need to check that the post-reunification support agreed in the plan is being met and to monitor the full range of factors that affect a child’s well-being, including -
* Ongoing and new support to address the root causes of violence in the home
* Ensuring children and families have ongoing access to health care, education and other basic services
* Monitoring the effectiveness of economic-strengthening support, and providing further support following the guidance offered in section
* Continuing to support efforts to address stigma and discrimination through work with the community, including religious leaders
* Ensuring that children have a chance to discuss experiences and to receive therapeutic support where necessary
* Support may be delivered directly by case workers or through referrals to other agencies, though case workers should always coordinate the assistance provided.
* Finally, if reintegration fails, the child needs to be placed in alternative care whilst other options are considered.

## Spontaneous or sudden reunification
* Some girls and boys will return home themselves without the intervention of agencies, or may reunify suddenly, for example as an institution has closed down.
* Frequently, these children are given lower priority since the links with the family seem to have already been re-forged by the child; however, problems in such cases often come to light because the ‘honeymoon period’ is over and conflict within the family has increased.

## Reintegration and prevention of separation strategies

* Visits to children’s communities of origin as part of efforts to monitor and support reintegration offer an opportunity to identify the factors that lead to separation, and a chance to tackle some of the root causes of separation.
* Throughout the reintegration process, it is crucial that agencies do not inadvertently promote family separation, by, for example, indicating that separated children will receive more support than their peers on returning home. 
* There is a particular need to give careful consideration to the planning and communication of any material support 
* Agencies are encouraged to follow up with the community to find out how assistance has been interpreted; if there is any notion of it being an incentive to separate, then they are advised to take immediate action.
-  Case closure
	* Ending monitoring – or closing a case – occurs when the worker is confident that the child’s safety and well being are secure. The following process should be followed:
	* review all observations and notes made throughout the monitoring period;
	* consider with the child and family the overall progress they have made against the case plan’s objectives;
	* consult with other service providers (including teachers, health workers, etc.) to obtain a broad range of perspectives; and
	* carefully assess the likelihood and potential severity of risks to the child.
	* Once all of this information has been taken into account, the worker may recommend that the case be closed with a final decision being made by a supervisor or inter-agency case review panel.
	* All updated documentation should be retained confidentially in case re-separation occurs and cases have to be re-opened.


# **Working with Communities and Schools**

## Working with Communities
* In addition to a case work approach with individual children and families, efforts with schools and wider communities are important for successful reintegration. Schools and communities can help both to tackle stigma and discrimination, and to monitor and support reintegrating children.
* The role of communities may be especially important in settings where formal social services are weak.
* Engaging with community leaders or groups to explore their feelings about the returning children, encourage greater understanding of the challenges children faced whilst separated, and assist with efforts to reduce discrimination against returnees. 
* Convening meetings with communities to explore any tensions that may exist
* Enabling a dialogue between the child/family and the community if the community feels that the child has acted in a way that breaks with traditions. 
* Where large groups of children are being reintegrated, offering peer-to-peer support, such as support groups or pairing each newly reunified child with a ‘buddy’ who is further along in the process.
* Working with the community to prevent (re)separation
* Working with local media to change attitudes towards reintegrating children in the community.

## Working with Schools
* As noted above, education plays an essential role in the reintegration of separated children, and there is much that schools can do to support this process.
* Understand any discrimination that the child is likely to face in school at the hands of teachers, parents and students, and make efforts to tackle this discrimination.
* Provide additional support to help reintegrating children who have missed out on schooling to catch up.
* Ensure that schools are safe havens for children – work to reduce violence in schools and take steps to address situations where schools are used as recruiting grounds for trafficking, gangs or child soldiers.


## **Monitoring and Evaluation 
* Monitoring can occur at three interlinked but distinct levels:
	* the individual case – in order to track child and family well-being and inform care plans
	* the agency’s programme – in order to track progress, quality and effectiveness of implementation and inform programme planning and development
	* the overall, multi-actor reintegration effort – in order to identify coverage, gaps and effective good practice.
* In line with the definition included in these guidelines, ‘successful reintegration’ should consider not just whether children have been reunited with families, but also if they have a sense of belonging and purpose in all spheres of life. indicators should be developed with the involvement of
	* children currently being reintegrated, asking them what they feel will help them in the future;
	* children who have been reintegrated, asking them what was important to them in successful reintegration;
	* local children in the community, asking them about what they feel would help a child to reintegrate in their community;
	* families, asking about the kind of support that was important to them in the reintegration process;
	* elders, religious leaders or other adults, asking them about the elements needed for a child to be accepted and included in the community.
	* output indicators (the direct products or services provided) outcome and impact indicators (which examine the success of efforts to reintegrate a child, and changes in child, family or community or the wider policy environment likely to enhance reintegration). Programme designers are strongly encouraged to develop their own indicators based on the specifics of their programme and on the perspectives of stakeholders involved in reintegration processes.
* According to Ethiopian guidelines[^3],
	* A childcare organization working on child-family reunification, after reunifying the child, shall conduct follow-up at least once in a year on the overall and specific development of a child till the child is well adjusted within the family and the surrounding environment. The follow up shall include child’s development with respect to:
        * health status
        * nutritional status
        * physical development
        * educational development
        * social development; and
        * emotional and spiritual development
* Outcome and impact indicators of the process overall:
	* Children and families are able to accept reunification
	* Families agree to a post-reunification support plan
	* Children feel welcomed into their families
	* Transfer of case files to local authorities
* At Sneha Care home[^5],

                * Did you experience any discrimination at home at any level? 
            * General 5
                * Have you noticed that many children don’t have parents here? What do you think about it?

            * The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a brief behavioural screening questionnaire about 3-16 year olds. 
            * It was administered along with Rutter questionnaires to parents and teachers of children drawn from psychiatric clinics. 
            * A focus on strengths as well as difficulties; better coverage of inattention, peer relationships and prosocial behaviour are its salient features.
    * Procedures involved in children’s care at SCH:
        * All such procedures have been recorded in a manual, therefore all cases of PCG involvement that appear in the manual have been extracted and listed below. They have been grouped under one of five headings based on the nature of involvement they denote. 
    

# Gold Standard Models 
## Sneha Care Home - Blended Model
* [^5]The image of the institution as a segregating form of care, cutting members off from their communities and undermining their possibilities for forming meaningful social ties is not entirely unwarranted. 
* Staff members’ fear of what might happen to the vulnerable children under their care – which is born of their own disconnection from the children’s communities – leads to policies which further disconnect them and the children under their care from those communities. It is a vicious circle.
* Under India’s National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), over 300 (check) Community Care Centres (CCCs) were set up with the aim of providing community outreach and ensuring accessible support and health care for PLHA. 
* Most CCCs are faith-based – and their roles include providing medical care, forms of counselling, psychosocial, educational and nutritional support, linking individuals to ART centres and tracking drug adherence, among other things. Moreover, they help in day-to-day issues like ensuring vulnerable families have ration cards and access to the job market as well as providing vital outreach services for the community.
* Between 2006 and 2011, the USAID (United States Agency for International Development)Samastha programme became a catalyst for increasing the number of CCCs in Karnataka (there were previously ten). The role of the Sneha Care Team within this programme was that of a mentor, offering a supportive role to the Centres.

## Practices used by Sneha Care Home:
- Once a child is accepted into SCH, working with NGOs – mainly their counsellors, outreach workers and project coordinators enables the Sneha Care Team to cultivate a vital link between the institution and the child’s community. 
- For starters, NGOs are an integral component of SCH’s “Keep the Parents Alive” policy, which supports parents of the CLHA under its care. SCH checks up on the health situation of positive parents by keeping in touch with NGOs and on a number of occasions itself refers parents to NGOs when concerns about their health or socioeconomic well-being arise.
- It was insisted at various points that the purpose of these visits is less to “check up” on the child than to provide its staff members with an insight into the child’s background. To date, SCH staff members have jointly managed to cover 80 percent of children’s PCGs’ homes. Staff members typically spend a maximum of thirty minutes in each house, though there is no set time. 
- The idea is to collect basic data, including an assessment of PCGs’ economic situation and to get a feel of the children’s backgrounds and communities. Home visits were also introduced with the aim of linking children to NGOs if no prior connection existed and identifying secondary caregivers for children.
- All the one hundred children currently at SCH were brought to the institution’s attention by Community Care Centres (CCCs), NGOs, PLHIV Networks (hereafter jointly referred to as NGOs) or by primary caregivers themselve
- That socioeconomic factors and the desire to provide their children with an education are primary motivations for the child’s enrolment in SCH is indicated by PCGs’ own written accounts in a number of information gathering exercises carried out by SCH as well as SCH staff members in individual interviews.
- Caring for CLHA is made more complicated still since in a number of places across India, enrolment in a community-based school is difficult for CLHA due to stigma. Misinformation fuels fears among fellow students’ parents that studying with a CLHA will put their own child at risk, often providing an effective barrier to education for this population
- This is since many of the children are brought forward for admission through NGOs that seek out “the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children among the infected children in the area.” 73 Moreover, the Home’s policy is that “preference will be given to orphans,” and that “children of single parents and children living with parents will be considered only after assessing the family condition...”

### Role of Primary Caregivers (PCGs):
- It should be noted at the outset that “primary caregiver” is the technical term used by SCH to refer to the person – outside of SCH staff who is primarily responsible for any major decisions regarding the child. The primary caregiver is responsible for decisions like the child’s enrolment in SCH (subject to SCH acceptance) and discharge. The primary caregiver is also responsible for phoning and visiting the child and taking the child home for holiday(s). 
- Unless the point calls for specification as to whether a parent, extended kin or an non-relative entrusted with the child’s care is being referred to, the “PCG” (primary caregiver) will be used, and should be taken to mean any of these three.
- Certainly, SCH’s “Keep the parents alive” policy – which networks with NGOs to ensure infected parents of the children under its care receive adequate medical care and supervision is a form of “empowering
- “Teaching” PCGs did not preclude the latter’s possibilities for empowered caregiving, indeed it positively facilitated it. In their interviews, SCH staff members maintained that their links with NGOs help to promote as far as possible, benefits such as access to ration cards and employment for a number of the family members of children under their care.

# Barries to acceptance of alternate care models in India
In a paper that describes existing alternate care systems in India[^7], we learn that there are socio-cultural barriers that create resistance to upholding formal alternative care in India.
- ### Apathy: 
	- The dislike of change creates a resistance to accepting a person (child) of a different ethnic group. Since India is a large and diverse country, the population is also diverse. Families often show resistance to accepting an unrelated child from a different background. Religion, region, caste, colour, and language of the child often become the reasons for non-acceptance by prospective foster families. In an ideal situation it is required that foster parents should respect the religious practices and beliefs of the birthparents, even though the child is in foster care. Religious beliefs of people are rigid since practices vary vastly, hence it is challenging to place a child with a family which has different religious practices
- ### Fear of separation and emotional vulnerability: 
	-  Indian culture gives priority to emotions and believes in developing relationships with significant others. Families in India also fear developing an emotional bond and attachment to the foster child and this creates resistance to fostering a child. 
- ### Too much emphasis on permanent placement i.e. adoption: 
	- Other forms/options (short term arrangements of care for the children) of alternative care are neglected by the child protection professionals since adoption has been accorded priority due to its permanent nature. 
	- Additionally, adoption as a care placement of the children has gained recognition among the general public. 
	- The prospective families want to have parental rights over the child they provide care for so they do not want to invest in a child without having parental rights. The families prefer to have a child permanently placed with them. 
- ### Corruption:  
	- As recently quoted by the CEO of  the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA, India), foster care has been misused/ exploited by people as certain unethical practices have crept in.
- ### Lack of awareness:  
	- Since the understanding and awareness of foster care and other non-institutional care options for children has not fully evolved in India, the gap between policy and practice remains. This has caused the foster care programme to become a backdoor entry into adoption or an entry point for misuse.
- ### Preference for a younger child 
	- One of the issues that the foster care system in India is facing is that families want a younger child. Younger children are  preferred since they easily adjust to the family and it is easy to train the child to fit into their family. 
	- Not only in cases of adoption, but even families who had chosen foster care had expressed the desire for a young child. 
	- The process of placing older children who could not be put up for adoption in foster care is impractical since older children are not wanted.
- ### Ambiguous policies and guidelines:  
	- The policies and guidelines for alternative care in India are either not in place or ambiguous. There is a need for advocacy and involvement of various stakeholders to develop effective policies and guidelines. The government and concerned departments need to take a proactive move to put the systems in place.
- ### Lack of trained staff:  
	- The functionaries are neither familiar with the laws and regulations nor are they well trained to deal with the issues of child protection vis-a-vis alternative care. Capacity building programmes for the functionaries working with the children need to be designed and delivered. Additionally, they should be sensitised and trained in monitoring and follow up concerns.
- ### Lack of funds to support the children and caregivers:  
	- The budgetary allocations to family-based alternative care provisions are meagre and are not sufficient for the requirements of the children in need of care and protection. Where funds are allocated, they are being under utilised or not utilised at all.
- ### Large numbers of the children in need of care and protection
	-   Since India is a huge country, the number of children in need of care and protection is also large. Hence it is a long and tiring process which takes a lot of effort and consistently hard work to develop a pool of prospective families willing to provide short term residential care for such children.

# Problems associated with alternative care systems:
[^8]
According to a paper on the challenges in social reintegration of children from institutional care, these are the following challenges we observe in different systems, 

## Family Restoration

- The problem with family restoration (for some children) is that the children are sent back to the same environment where they were abuse and neglected. 
- There are also children (abandoned, surrendered and orphan) who do not have family and are not adopted; in this case, the institutions find it difficult to restore them to a family environment. 
- Furthermore, instead of changing the child's behaviour and attitude, institutional care merely restores the child without adequate planning and preparation and pressurize the parents to take the child back (if the child has some attitude or behavioural problems). 
- Some parents who never visited their children Child does not receive moral and financial support 
- Parents without a sense of responsibility Not willing to take back the child 
- Children prefer to stay back - Some children refusing to be restored 

## Sponsorship

### What is sponsorship?
- Preventing institutionalizing and rehabilitating and social integrating through sponsorship Sponsorship is another method for rehabilitating and social integrating of children. 
- The programme helps in preventing a child from being institutionalized and restores the child to the family. 
- It is of two types preventive and rehabilitative. As the name suggests, the former prevents the children from being institutionalized and later rehabilitating and integrating children out of the institutions to the family (The Integrated Child Protection Scheme, 2014). 

### Problems with sponsorship
- The study shows that not a single child from the twenty childcare institutions uses the scheme to help children’s institutional recovery. Two children from one institution were chosen for sponsorship but were not funded (although the selection list was declared more than a year ago). 
- Parents tend to keep the children in institutional care rather than receive a mere two thousand rupees.
- There is no proper knowledge in the community as such people are unaware of the programmes. 
- Moreover, institutional care providers are also unaware of the programme 
- The delay in sanctioning money was another reason why the sponsorshop programme fails. 

## Foster Care
- Foster care as means for preparing children ’ s rehabilitation and social integration Like adoption, foster care is also one way for children to be rehabilitated and socially integrated. 
- Children still can be in a family environment; however, it is just temporary. It is one way of preparing for the adoption of children. 
- The child welfare committee makes the final decision for foster care after studying the family's intent, capacity, and experiences living with children. Foster parents are also responsible for the health, education, nutrition and well-being of children compared to adoption (The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, n.d.)

### Problems with foster care
- The study indicates that not a single child from the twenty child care institutions is placed in a foster care facility. 
- Surprisingly, some insti tutional cares are unaware of the policy and programme for keeping a child in foster care. 
- The institutional staffs that are aware of the programme are also confused with whom to approach and avail the services as it is not effective. Therefore, the staffs who prepare the individual care plan for each child do not select or recommend these methods for the rehabilitation and social integration of children because they do not function effectively.
- The caregiver also points out that people do not inquire about taking in children for foster care which is also one of the reasons for not keeping child in a foster care. This certainly violates children’s rights to foster care and with a family. 

## Problems with Adoption

### Rules and guidelines
- It is stated and also observed that the rules are rigid, the procedures are lengthy, and the state scenario is not always applicable. While it prohibits unlawful adoption of children, it is difficult for parents to adopt a child because parents must be physically, psychologically and financially stable without any criminal history. Concerning their income, health, etc., they have to organize and send various documents. 
- They have to register on the website as Prospective Adoptive Parents (PAPs) and wait for their chance. Besides, matching is also carried out by the Central Adoption Resource Agency (CARA) and not by the adoption agency concerned. 
- Parents cannot physically pick the children, and the child's preference is often an issue again when done online. If the prospective parents are pleased with the child, a home study will be performed by the Specialist Adoption Agency (SAA) of the respective state and recommended for adoption.
-  Otherwise, the process must again start with the parents waiting for their opportunity and CARA matching the parent – child. This slows the process of adop - tion, meaning children have to live in institutional care for longer. 
- The study also indicates that registered prospective parents waiting for their chance are so high compared to children who are adopted.

### Differently able or girl child usually left out. 
- The study also suggests that most prospective parents prefer a male boy, ideally be - tween 0 and 3 years of age. Children with different able or special needs are only adopted by foreigners and not within the state or country (which is also minimal).
- Therefore, children who are otherwise differ - ently able, older children and girls are generally left out. Surprisingly, in two institutions (specialized adoption agency), not a single child in the institutions nor any child was available for adoption.
