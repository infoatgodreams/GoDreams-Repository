# The Need for Alternative Care Systems

# Legal and Policy Frameworks on Restoration
[^2]
According to a document that outlines the guidelines for reintegration of children to families, these guidelines are based on
* The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) (UN 1989);
*  The Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children, welcomed by the UN in 2009 (UN GA 2010); 
* Inter-agency Guiding Principles on Unaccompanied and Separated Children (ICRC, IRC, Save the Children, UNICEF, UNHCR and World Vision 2004); 
* The UN Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty (UN 1990); 
* The Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children (UN 2000);
*  Minimum Standards for Child Protection in Humanitarian Action (CPWG 2012).

# Restoration
* [^1] According to a care manual created by Prerna, **Definition: The process of reuniting a child with their family is known as restoration**
* The right of children to not be separated from one’s family and, if separated from one’s family for whatever reasons, then their right to be restored to their family has been articulated explicitly in recent laws and instruments. 
	* Unfortunately, there may be situations where the natural or extended families, and more appropriately natural parents and close natural relatives get separated from their child, or become incompetent, disinclined to provide care and protection to their child or become a source of harm to the child. In such cases, the responsibility to provide care and protection may fall on the State. This corrective measure is also called deinstitutionalization but the term describes only a part of the larger process of restoration.
* According to a document that outlines restoration guidelines, Family reintegration is what the majority of the separated children and their families want (BCN et al. 2013). 
	* These guidelines explores principles of good practice in children’s reintegration aimed primarily at child protection programme managers in low and lower-middleincome contexts. 
	* The guidelines cover reintegration back into families of origin and do not coverplacement into alternative care or new families through adoption or similar practices.
	* **Definition of Reintegration**: “The process of a separated child making what is anticipated to be a permanent transition back to his or her family and community (usually of origin), in order to receive protection and care and to find a sense of belonging and purpose in all spheres of life.”

## Why is reintegration/restoration so important? 
- According to a manual on the guidelines for institutional childcare in Ethiopia, reintegration is crucial in
	* preventing the various psycho-social problems that arise among children due to deprivation of familial care
	* facilitating conditions for the assimilation of children with their parents and/or members of extended family and promote their all rounded development
	* creating opportunities for children in which they can learn familial and social values and norms living with their parents and/or members of the extended family; and
	* supporting parents and/or members of extended families to re-assume their responsibility to cater for their children.


# Key principles governing restoration interventions
According to a guideline document on global restoration practices, we need to keep these principles in mind while designing an effective reintegration policy. 

## Prioritise family unity and be child-centred
* It is vital to recognise the central importance of family unity to child well-being and development and to actively explore reintegration with a child’s family of origin as the first priority to pursue. 
* Familiesand children must be at the centre of all reintegration support efforts the value of family unity is acknowledged in international law, including the UNCRC (UN 1989).

## Embed reintegration in wider child protection systems
* Safe and effective support for reintegration must be embedded within broader systems to protect children. 
* There should be adequate funding to support reintegration, clear legislation and guidance on all of the stages of the reintegration process, and a skilled child welfare workforce able to support it.
* Agencies should work towards properly functioning child protection systems that can adequately support the reintegration of all groups of separated children.

### Effective child protection systems include the following components 
* National legislation and guidance: governments should work to develop and integrate policies.In cases where appropriate legislation and guidance does not exist, civil society has an advocacy role to play.
*  A competent child welfare workforce: a mix of professional personnel, para professionals, and community volunteers Efforts should be made to encourage staff retention, thus enabling ongoing relationships with children and families.
* Adequate resource allocations and fiscal management: Budgets should reflect all of the costs associated with reintegrating children If funds are insufficient, organisations are encouraged to advocate for more funding and proactively consider how to meet the needs of the child until reintegration is complete, even if external funds falter, as it is dangerous to reintegrate a child without adequate follow-up support and monitoring.
* Service provision and case work individual work with children and families and an array of services.
* The engagement of a range of actors: Governments have overall responsibility for coordinating reintegration efforts, allocating adequate funding to reintegration and ensuring that efforts are properly monitored. NGOs, community groups, families and children themselves also play key roles.
* Collaboration with other systems: it is important to design and implement programmes in collaboration with actors in other sectors – such as education, social protection, justice, economic strengthening, law enforcement and health.
* Supportive social norms
* Monitoring and data collection: the absence of a well-funded and functioning child protection system should not be used an excuse for failing to effectively support the reintegration of children.

### To support effective reintegration, the  staff will need to be able to do the following
* Acknowledge diversity.
* Develop a warm, though professional relationship with the child: Trust and continuity are vital for forming this relationship.
* Recognise the challenges that children and families face in the reintegration process.
* Help children to speak out, particularly in contexts where it may be dangerous to speak out publicly, staff have a responsibility to create a safe and confidential space.
* Identify and build on strengths: Help children, families and communities to identify their own human and financial resources, and develop a strategy to build on them.
* Create local ownership: community engagement is particularly important in addressing this stigma.
* Act in a culturally knowledgeable way: It is important to identify solutions that leverage local methods of care and protection.

## Take a rights-based approach
* All efforts to promote safe and effective reintegration must be based on a consideration of the full range of rights included in the UNCRC, and relevant national laws.
* They have a right to participate in all decisions that affect them, and decisions regarding their reintegration should be made with their best interests as a primary consideration.
* Article 9 states children should not be separated from their parents unless it is in their best interests.
* The UNCRC includes four core principles which all apply to reintegration efforts
* Children’s rights are indivisible and interdependent, with no one right taking precedence over another.
* As one of the first steps, all efforts should be taken to clarify any legal issues relating to the identity and documentation of the child and his or her family; that said, under the UNCRC, all children in a territory – no matter what their status – are eligible for the protection of that State and its officers, including reintegration services, whether or not they have been legally documented.

## Do no harm
* All reunification and interventions that support reintegration should aim to benefit and not harm children.
* Agencies should carry out a full risk assessment to determine the harm that could be caused by reintegration interventions and to identify steps to mitigate risk to children, families and staff. These steps should include developing a safety plan with children so that they know who to contact if they face harm once reintegrated or if reintegration breaks down. 
* Efforts should be made to put in place proper mechanisms for safeguarding children from abuse or violence through organisational child protection policies and procedures to reduce the risk of staff or other stakeholders abusing children at any stage in the reintegration process.
* Throughout the process, informed consent ensures that individual children and families understand and agree to reintegration strategies and support.
* Steps must be put in place to store records in a way that maintains confidentiality. Agencies must carefully consider what information should be shared with the family and the child.

## Engage a range of stakeholders
* It is vital to involve a range of stakeholders in the reintegration process including children, families, communities, schools, the media, government actors, non-governmental organisations and the private sector. 
* Mapping and coordinating reintegration and related services is important for effective collaboration. 
* Agencies are strongly encouraged to collaborate to ensure that all of the child’s needs are covered. This involves:
* holding regular meetings to coordinate sharing of programme information and referral protocols, as well as system-wide monitoring and evaluation.
* finding effective and ethical ways to share case information, and considering joint programming initiatives.


# Identified Needs in Restoring Children

## Shelter
* Safety:
    * Ensuring the safety of a child victim is a challenging job in non-institutional settings like families. It is much easier to adhere to the legal guidelines of safety in formal institutional set-ups because they are well-funded, either run or monitored by the state authorities. 
    * Families on the other hand are independent units that may need assistance and support from time to time. As per the UN Guidelines for Alternative Care of Children, 2010, efforts need to focus on directing the child to remain or return to their parents, families, or guardians, when appropriate
    * A measure to assess and ensure the safety of CNCP is:
        * Social Investigation Report (SIR):
            * Typically, ‘found but untraced’ children or those whose rights seem to have been violated are produced before the CWC either by the Childline officials (a national child helpline service), police officials, or any ordinary citizen. 
            * Post the initial assessment, if the parents of the child are found, the CWC decides to place the child with the parents or guardians, until the inquiry is completed. If the parents or guardians cannot be traced, then, the child is temporarily placed in a CH, until the inquiry is completed. 
            * Often, during the period of inquiry, close relatives including the parents of the victim approach the CWC seeking the custody of the child. 
            * In such situations, it is critical to conduct a thorough assessment of the family, especially the parents, before restoring the child to them. This procedure of inquiry is called the Social Investigation and its report is called Social Investigation Report (SIR). 
            * The SIR needs to be completed within the 15 days of the CWC passing the Order, so that the CWC can pass a Final Order within four months of the first production of the child. 
            * The Social Investigation includes interacting with the child, the case worker (the CCI staff) assigned to the child, as well as the Investigating Officer (the police) and any other significant individuals such as the family and school in the case as the Committee deems relevant.
            * While the information collected and presented in the SIR is based on facts observed or recorded, there is some scope to add suggestions, recommendations, or pressing observations from the case workers
    * Care and Protection 
    * While safety has a more physical connotation of keeping the child safe, care and protection entails the socio-cultural elements of a child’s well-being.
    * Multiple aspects are covered under the care and protection, these are:
        * Immunity against re-trafficking
            * When victims are trafficked by known persons (known as acquaintances) into the sex trade, there is a possibility of the victim being sexually maltreated, intimidated, threatened, or trafficked yet again. 
            * In cases where the trafficker (or their family) is in close physical proximity to the child victim and their family, their vulnerability increases. Thus, restoring a child victim in such environments may not be safe. 
            * The child victim’s physical proximity to the trafficker needs to be assessed and considered while conducting the inquiry and making a decision for restoration
            * Case workers make the following assessments pre-restoration: 
                * Identifying the location and residence of the trafficker. 
                * Finding the current status of the trafficker or exploiter: If an offense has been registered and the trafficker is in jail, social workers follow up on the bail applications and keep the family apprised of the legal status of the case. 
                * Assessing the trafficker’s (if they have been released on bail) or their family’s (if the trafficker is in jail) behavior: There may be a possibility that the trafficker or their family may try to intimidate the victim’s family. All such relevant information is shared with the CWC to enable them to make an informed decision about the child’s care and protection. 
                * Assess the family’s capacity to manage and respond to a precipitating incident concerning the victim’s protection
            * Besides proximity to the trafficker, sometimes (especially in urban slum settlements), there might be disrupting instances and elements in the immediate social environment of the victim that might make them vulnerable to exploitation. 
            * These can include peer pressure to use or sell drugs, high incidences of sexual violence against women, poor or disintegrated social protection systems, or low vigilance by local administrators and law enforcement, etc. 
            * It is critical that a child is prepared for such social vulnerabilities during restoration.
        * Access to society and opportunities:
            * When the family is unaware of the crimes committed against their child and are made aware of the same, they might feel violated. 
            * The parents might question and re-examine their parenting style and yearn to provide a safe environment for their child. 
            * Thus, it is likely for the families to become vigilant of the child victim’s mobility and restrict their movement beyond the house and the immediate community. 
            * The stigma associated with sexual violence might also make the family overly cautious of the victim’s social interaction, including their presence online. 
            * This stigma can also make the family and victim feel distanced from their immediate social environment. These factors can adversely affect the child’s development.
            * It has been observed that a family’s over-cautious behavior can lead a child victim to internalize restrictions and confinement. To avoid the same, case workers interact with the child regularly and refer them to counselors to help them deal with their emotions.
            * Thus, following measures can be taken up by a caseworker as follow up conversations after the child is restored with the family:
                * Determine parents’ attitude towards the child’s routine movements in the community.
                * Understand the challenges of the child while moving outside their home
                * Family or parental counseling: In certain cases, the case workers may refer parents or the family for professional counseling to better equip them for creating a trustworthy environment for their child.
        * Adult supervision
            * The quality and presence of adult supervision, either parents or guardians, is critical to a child’s well-being. The absence of this supervision and guidance might result in an offense being (re)committed against the children. 
            * Thus, when a child is restored, it is essential to assess the nature of supervision available for them post-restoration.

## Health
### Nutrition
- Nutrition is a primary requirement for development. Children should have access to healthy, sumptuous, and nutritious food 3 to 4 times a day. The quantity of the meals depends on the child’s age and developmental stages of growth. 
    * When a child victim is in a CCI, the food and nutrition requirements are taken care of and monitored regularly as per the prescribed guidelines. 
    * However, once the child is restored to their family, the victim’s access to healthy and nutritious food needs to be assessed by the case workers through interaction and follow-ups with the family and the victim.
    * Follow-ups after restoration should focus on understanding the relevant family practices, gender, and other social biases about food and nutrition and its impact on the child’s overall growth and development.

# The stages in the reintegration process

The following systems and processes are outlined in a document that clearly explains the global guidelines for restoration projects. 

## Tracing, assessment and planning

### Assessment of the child

* An individual assessment should be carried out with each child to identify their specific needs which are likely to vary by factors such as age, gender and experience whilst separated.
* It can be useful to develop context specific criteria for assessment which examine factors that may affect the reintegration of specific groups of children and this should be done in full consultation with children and families.

### Family tracing and Best Interests Determination
* In both emergency and non-emergency settings, it is often necessary to carry out extensive work to trace a child’s family. This tracing should take place after the initial assessment of the child, and may include identifying and tracing family members in different areas or even countries who could take care of the child.
    * Trace and locate the biological parent/s; or
    * Trace and locate member/s of the extended family where biological parent/s are untraceable
    * Confirming the willingness of the parent/s and/or member/s of the extended family
* it is always valuable to properly assess the best interests of the child, BID tools can be useful in the assessment process.
* Details of good practice in the assessment of the child
* Ensure the well-being of each child is quickly assessed by trained staff.
* Build trust between the child and a case worker.
* Evaluate the child’s present environment
* Consider all areas of the child’s well-being and the resources needed for successful reintegration
* Carefully consider if children should be involved in legal proceedings against their exploiters/abusers.
* Include a range of perspectives in the assessment of the child.

### Assessment of the family

* Once parents or other family members have been traced, an assessment of the family should occur.
* A basic model includes a preliminary assessment of:
	* risk factors that affect the safety and well-being of the child and changes that need to be made;
	* family strengths and resilience, including those of siblings;
	* family members’ perception of the reasons for separation and other problems;
	* the family’s level of readiness/capacity for change;
	* the family’s ability to care for the child;
	* the family’s economic situation.

### Assessment of the community

* It is important to assess their capacity to support children and families, and to challenge any stigma and discrimination they may face. Risks in the wider community should also be assessed.

## Developing a plan
* An individualised plan sets out a strategy for addressing the child’s and family’s needs and maximising their strengths, as identified in the assessment.
* Plans should also:
	* be shared with all family members and acknowledged by signature or a similar sign;
	* identify resources that the family can draw on, such as services or support in the community;
	* set specific, measurable, time-bound objectives, which can be used a tool for checking progress,
	* including prior to case closure;
	* cover all important areas of well-being and the indicators to assess them;
	* be developed with the child’s safety and confidentiality in mind; and
	* contain a contingency plan/ information about who children and family members should contact if the plan goes wrong and relationships breakdown.
	* Where possible, especially where dynamics are complex, it is recommended that a meeting is organised involving the child and family members. This may be done through family conferencing (see Box 6 below) where children and family members come together to develop a plan for the child with the facilitation of professionals.
* Global guidance on case management suggests plans should be reviewed at least every three months (CPWG 2014 and UN GA 2010).
* Helping the family to develop the plan themselves and take more ownership of their future is valuable (e.g. by providing ‘partial support’, where the family pays a proportion of a particular expense and the organisation pays the remainder).
* Case planning should include a consideration of the legal guardianship of the child and the point at which this will need to be handed back to the family (and to whom within the family).

## Preparation of children and families

## Ensuring a caring environment pre-reintegration

* Throughout the preparatory stage, it is important to consider the environment in which the child is living. In many cases, it will be necessary to remove children from situations of immediate harm and place them in some form of alternative care whilst they await reintegration.
* In line with global guidance, where possible, alternatives should be sought to large-scale institutions, including dormitory style transit centres.
* Children should remain in alternative care for as long as is needed to prepare them for reintegration or, where this is not possible, to find them a new permanent family.
* Considerations in providing alternative care for children whilst awaiting reintegration
* Enable children to mix with local communities and not become isolated.
* Balance meeting children’s basic needs with creating culturally appropriate conditions.
* Engage children in culturally appropriate daily responsibilities and decisions, such as cooking and cleaning, determining recreational activities or having some input in the daily schedule.
* Speak openly of the shared goal of family reintegration.
* Locate foster care placements and transit centres as close to home as possible.
* Develop conflict resolution mechanisms.
* Develop children’s capacity to act autonomously.
* Provide opportunities to express emotions safely.
* Create an atmosphere for healing and rehabilitation.

## Tackling discrimination and issues of identity

* Many reintegrating boys and girls are discriminated against because of their life during separation, such as their association with armed forces or a criminal group, exposure to sexual abuse or exploitation, pregnancy out of marriage, or exploitative forms of work. They may also experience discrimination due to gender, disability, HIV status, caste, ethnicity, sexual orientation or other status. Tackling this discrimination as far as possible before they return home is vital to ensure their successful reintegration.
* Staff may need to mediate between the child and family and/or community members, helping them express their feelings and accept changes in the child.
* While children should not be expected to return to being exactly as they were prior to the separation, if reintegration is to be successful, a child needs to recognise that his/her previous role and ‘identity’ may have to change.
* Helping a child re-learn his or her culture, dialect and religion10 is important, though this may well take longer than just the preparatory stage.

## Addressing abuse, neglect, violence and exploitation in the family

* Abuse, neglect, violence and exploitation within the family are extremely common reasons for children leaving home. With intensive effort, it is often possible to tackle these issues, allowing the child to return safely to the family. giving consideration to removing the abuser from the home if necessary.
* Ensuring that systems are in place to regularly monitor and support the child and family following reintegration,
* The use of evidence-based and culturally appropriate therapeutic approaches for children or other family members experiencing significant distress
* Referrals to medical services if needed.

## Meeting mental and physical health needs, responding to addiction

* Meeting the range of health needs of the child or caregivers/parents during the preparatory phase includes:
* ongoing treatment of any health concerns, including addictions;
* training staff to recognise emotional and psychological distress, and to take mental well-being seriously,
* with referrals to appropriately trained professionals as necessary;
* an assessment of the extent to which mental and physical health challenges can be met by the family and community after reunification, and ensuring that support is in place to respond to health needs.

## Supporting children with disabilities

* During the preparatory phase, it is important to properly assess children with disabilities using a qualified expert and to work to rehabilitate children as appropriate
* In general, the focus should be on making the environment accessible and inclusive, not on trying to ‘fix’ children with disabilities to make them fit into society.
* When raising the possibility of reintegration, staff are advised to discuss openly any concerns with children and families, and to stress the agency’s commitment to continue to support access to rehabilitation services, medical treatment (if needed) or other required services once home.

## Planning for education and life skills training

* Quality, safe schooling can be used to help children learn necessary life skills, and teachers can help to keep an eye on at-risk children, making referrals where necessary. Efforts to ensure that children have access to school must start during the preparatory phase.
* Children, families and case workers will need to consider if it is viable to return children to settings where there is no access to schooling or if other alternatives should be sought (such as encouraging the family to move closer to schools, or placement with relatives during the academic year).

## Household economic strengthening and material support

* it is fundamentally important to understand the role that poverty may have played in any case of separation and to address it appropriately and effectively.
* Effective economic strengthening measures can reduce both poverty and stress within a family. During the preparatory phase, it is important to take the following measures.
* Use information from the family assessment to determine the livelihood security of the household.
* Ensure that economic interventions are tailored to the household’s capacities and the economic context.
* If market-based household economic strengthening is needed, seek relevant technical expertise.
* If new economic-strengthening initiatives are needed, seek reliable partners that have enabled poor families to achieve sustained economic self-support.
* If an appropriate partner cannot be found, managers will need to consider implementing their own economic-strengthening programmes; this may entail bringing in specialised staff or consultants.
* In addition to economic strengthening, other forms of material support, such as new beds or housing repairs, may be offered to families based on the need to help ease the child’s transition back into the household.
* For reasons of social harmony, economic-strengthening programmes must proactively strive to balance the needs of families with returnee children and those of impoverished families more generally.

## Determining who will carry out monitoring and follow-up support

* In order to ensure a smooth and continuous transition, it is important to establish prior to reunification who will monitor the returning child: an agency case worker, another worker (e.g. teacher, government social worker, community organisation), community volunteer, religious leader, etc.
* In general, it is a good idea for the case worker to make periodic visits that decrease in frequency over time, and for others actually living or working in the community of origin to act as closer observers, with a clear point of contact in case problems arise
3. Child’s initial contact with family and reunification

## Initial contact with families

* The process of reintroducing the child to the family and community should unfold gradually, according to each child’s individual needs, and should not be rushed.
* Possible steps to facilitate initial contact with families
* Enable remote contact through a letter/email, call, or video message:
* Short face-to-face meetings between parents/carers and child: Where feasible, the parent should travel to the child, which provides a clear indication of the parent’s commitment to reintegration, even though the agency may fund the travel. In some cases, such visits are unsafe and a neutral location is better, e.g. if the child was abducted and it is not yet safe to reveal his or her location.
* Longer, supervised visits at the parents’/carers’ home.
* Longer, unsupervised visits at the parents’/carers’ home: This type of meeting is only performed after a supervised visit has been successful.
* Throughout this phase, it is important that agencies ensure that contact has been re-established with other siblings who may not be living with the parents and may, for example, be in institutional care separately from the reintegrating child.
* Using the law to force parents or other caregivers to accept a child for reunification is never recommended.
* If the parents/caregivers or child refuse reunification, the case worker should revisit the contingency component of the plan. If that provides no appropriate option, then children will need to be kept or placed in alternative care and then, if reintegration is either not possible or appropriate, found a new permanent family through, for example, adoption or kafalah.

## Family reunification

* Reunification is the step that passes care and/or formal guardianship of the child back to his or her parents or traditional caregiver. Since this event is emotionally challenging for children, it is recommended that they be given as much control over it as possible: choosing the case worker to accompany them, choosing what to wear, etc.
* Possible steps in the family reunification process
	* Transfer of care back to family: As far as possible, parents/caregivers should state in writing their willingness to resume responsibility for the child and that they understand the implications of this.
	* Case transfer: It is recommended that (where possible) the case worker accompanies the child to meet the individual who will take over the case, reviews the paperwork with them, and involves local officials.
	* Reunification package and enrolment in services, including formal education: When access to the new community has been limited, the point of reunification becomes the opportunity to finalise arrangements of new services, e.g. enrolment with the local school, nursery or health service providers.
	* Acknowledgement of transition: 
		* The family and/or community who have been preparing for the child’s return may want to acknowledge it in a public fashion through, for example, speeches or a more elaborate welcoming/transition ceremony.
	- Post-reunification support
		* It is essential that agencies carefully monitor children on their return to families.
		* Follow-up support is as important as the work done during the preparatory stage.

## Monitoring child well-being

* It is vital that each child’s safety and well-being is monitored carefully after reunification.
* Monitoring may involve phone calls with the child, family or service providers, but should also include face-to-face visits. 
* It is recommended that an inter-agency protocol sets out benchmarks for the level and types of contact and support that each child should have following reunification. It is then important to monitor each child’s safety and well-being to determine benchmarks are being routinely met and whether additional action is required.
* During the follow-up phase, the case worker should speak with the child, parents, siblings, other relevant relatives and individuals who have a role to play in the child’s welfare (e.g. teachers, child protection committee members, religious leaders). 
* They must look out for signs of abuse or neglect Agencies must ensure that the child or someone he or she trusts has a way to contact the case worker and an emergency plan if immediate intervention is necessary.

## Follow-up support

* Staff need to check that the post-reunification support agreed in the plan is being met and to monitor the full range of factors that affect a child’s well-being, including -
* Ongoing and new support to address the root causes of violence in the home
* Ensuring children and families have ongoing access to health care, education and other basic services
* Monitoring the effectiveness of economic-strengthening support, and providing further support following the guidance offered in section
* Continuing to support efforts to address stigma and discrimination through work with the community, including religious leaders
* Ensuring that children have a chance to discuss experiences and to receive therapeutic support where necessary
* Support may be delivered directly by case workers or through referrals to other agencies, though case workers should always coordinate the assistance provided.
* Finally, if reintegration fails, the child needs to be placed in alternative care whilst other options are considered.

## Spontaneous or sudden reunification
* Some girls and boys will return home themselves without the intervention of agencies, or may reunify suddenly, for example as an institution has closed down.
* Frequently, these children are given lower priority since the links with the family seem to have already been re-forged by the child; however, problems in such cases often come to light because the ‘honeymoon period’ is over and conflict within the family has increased.

## Reintegration and prevention of separation strategies

* Visits to children’s communities of origin as part of efforts to monitor and support reintegration offer an opportunity to identify the factors that lead to separation, and a chance to tackle some of the root causes of separation.
* Throughout the reintegration process, it is crucial that agencies do not inadvertently promote family separation, by, for example, indicating that separated children will receive more support than their peers on returning home. 
* There is a particular need to give careful consideration to the planning and communication of any material support 
* Agencies are encouraged to follow up with the community to find out how assistance has been interpreted; if there is any notion of it being an incentive to separate, then they are advised to take immediate action.
-  Case closure
	* Ending monitoring – or closing a case – occurs when the worker is confident that the child’s safety and well being are secure. The following process should be followed:
	* review all observations and notes made throughout the monitoring period;
	* consider with the child and family the overall progress they have made against the case plan’s objectives;
	* consult with other service providers (including teachers, health workers, etc.) to obtain a broad range of perspectives; and
	* carefully assess the likelihood and potential severity of risks to the child.
	* Once all of this information has been taken into account, the worker may recommend that the case be closed with a final decision being made by a supervisor or inter-agency case review panel.
	* All updated documentation should be retained confidentially in case re-separation occurs and cases have to be re-opened.


# **Working with Communities and Schools**

## Working with Communities
* In addition to a case work approach with individual children and families, efforts with schools and wider communities are important for successful reintegration. Schools and communities can help both to tackle stigma and discrimination, and to monitor and support reintegrating children.
* The role of communities may be especially important in settings where formal social services are weak.
* Engaging with community leaders or groups to explore their feelings about the returning children, encourage greater understanding of the challenges children faced whilst separated, and assist with efforts to reduce discrimination against returnees. 
* Convening meetings with communities to explore any tensions that may exist
* Enabling a dialogue between the child/family and the community if the community feels that the child has acted in a way that breaks with traditions. 
* Where large groups of children are being reintegrated, offering peer-to-peer support, such as support groups or pairing each newly reunified child with a ‘buddy’ who is further along in the process.
* Working with the community to prevent (re)separation
* Working with local media to change attitudes towards reintegrating children in the community.

## Working with Schools
* As noted above, education plays an essential role in the reintegration of separated children, and there is much that schools can do to support this process.
* Understand any discrimination that the child is likely to face in school at the hands of teachers, parents and students, and make efforts to tackle this discrimination.
* Provide additional support to help reintegrating children who have missed out on schooling to catch up.
* Ensure that schools are safe havens for children – work to reduce violence in schools and take steps to address situations where schools are used as recruiting grounds for trafficking, gangs or child soldiers.


## **Monitoring and Evaluation 
* Monitoring can occur at three interlinked but distinct levels:
	* the individual case – in order to track child and family well-being and inform care plans
	* the agency’s programme – in order to track progress, quality and effectiveness of implementation and inform programme planning and development
	* the overall, multi-actor reintegration effort – in order to identify coverage, gaps and effective good practice.
* In line with the definition included in these guidelines, ‘successful reintegration’ should consider not just whether children have been reunited with families, but also if they have a sense of belonging and purpose in all spheres of life. indicators should be developed with the involvement of
	* children currently being reintegrated, asking them what they feel will help them in the future;
	* children who have been reintegrated, asking them what was important to them in successful reintegration;
	* local children in the community, asking them about what they feel would help a child to reintegrate in their community;
	* families, asking about the kind of support that was important to them in the reintegration process;
	* elders, religious leaders or other adults, asking them about the elements needed for a child to be accepted and included in the community.
	* output indicators (the direct products or services provided) outcome and impact indicators (which examine the success of efforts to reintegrate a child, and changes in child, family or community or the wider policy environment likely to enhance reintegration). Programme designers are strongly encouraged to develop their own indicators based on the specifics of their programme and on the perspectives of stakeholders involved in reintegration processes.
* Outcome and impact indicators of the process overall:
	* Children and families are able to accept reunification
	* Families agree to a post-reunification support plan
	* Children feel welcomed into their families
	* Transfer of case files to local authorities
