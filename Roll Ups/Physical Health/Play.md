Evidence for value of play 



# Defining Play
- According a paper on the importance of play in health, play is described using a biological perspective
	- not fully functional in the context in which it appears
	- spontaneous, pleasurable, rewarding, and voluntary
	- different from other more serious behaviours in form (e.g. exaggerated) or timing (e.g. occurring early in life before the more serious version is needed)
	- repeated, but not in unvarying stereotypic form (e.g. rocking or pacing) 
	- initiated in the absence of severe stress 

# Why Play? 
A review paper on the importance of play in the development of child health[^2], discusses that:
- An evolutionary perspective dictates that play must serve an important purpose considering the costs it entails in terms of time, energy and risk of injury and predation 
- From a developmental perspective, play allows children to experiment with their behavioural and social repertoire, and to practice their physical and communication skills
- Play facilitates the development of social competence, emotional capacities and resilience, creativity and problem-solving skills
According to a paper that studied play in relation to cognition outcomes[^3], 
- Play has been related to the development of both cognition and social competence (Fisher, 1992). The findings indicate that the relationship between cognition and play is relatively robust.

## Play & Child Development 
According to a paper that studied the interplay of play and cognition[^3], 
- Play behaviours do not precisely mirror cognitive or other developmental processes, but play is an impetus for development.
- Studies describing play and its relationship to development have demonstrated associations with cognition, motor skills, language, sensory processing, socialization, affect, and disposition
- Children progress through a succession of simple to more complex play stages associated with cognition.
- The strong correlation between cognition and play parallels other studies of children with developmental disabilities. In these studies, children with cognitive delays progressed more slowly than typical peers in their achievement on standardized assessments of cognition; however, the correlation between cognition and play was moderate to high

## Play & Child Emotional Expression
In a paper that discusses the effect of play on child health development[^2], we look at how play forms children's identity

- Erikson (1977) proposed that play allows children to experiment with a wide range of experiences, and simulates their potential real-life consequences
- Piaget (1962) theorized that make-believe play provides children with opportunities to reproduce real-life conflicts, to work out ideal resolutions for their own pleasure, and to ameliorate negative feelings
	- Narratives and story-telling can support children in integrating a broad variety of positive and negative life experiences
	- In adolescence, co-constructed narratives have been linked to the development of identity, which is considered a key-element for mental health 
	- Play may also allow for the expression of frustration and rage, allowing the child (or adult) to cope with environmental challenges, thereby contributing to mental health 
	- play allows children to experiment and explore, and playful activities provide a secure setting for testing the consequences of many alternative scenarios, in order to develop a rich and flexible behavioural, social and emotional repertoire

# Types of Play

## **Physical play**

## Elements of Physical Play

According to a white paper on the role of play in children's development[^1], 
* In children it includes activity play (e.g. jumping, climbing, dancing, skipping, bike riding and ball play), fine-motor practice (e.g. sewing, colouring, cutting, junk modelling and manipulating action toys and construction toys) and what is usually referred to as ‘rough-and-tumble’ (play fighting with friends, siblings or caregivers). 

## Impact of Physical Play

* In a more recent review, Brussoni et al. (2015) concluded that ‘the evidence suggests overall positive effects of risky outdoor play on a variety of health indicators and behaviours in children aged 3-12 years. However, they pointed out that these conclusions were based on ‘very low’ to ‘moderate’ quality evidence
* Becker et al. (2014) used accelerometers to assess preschool children’s level of physical activity and found a medium level correlation (0.46) with **cognitive self-regulation**, measured using the Head-Toes-Knees-Shoulders Task (HTKS) test. 
* There was also a significant indirect effect of active play on maths and literacy scores via the HTKS test, leading to the conclusion that self-regulation mediates a relationship between active play and school achievement. 
* In regards to **rough-and-tumble play**, Bjorklund & Brown (1998) suggested that it facilitates development of social cognition through the coding and decoding of social cues or signals.
* In one study, for example, moderate to large positive correlations, for popular children and for boys (but not for rejected children and girls), were found between rough-and-tumble play and higher interpersonal cognitive problem solving scores.
* Colwell & Lindsey (2005) also found these kinds of differential relationships according to gender. They reported that, for boys (but not girls), same-sex rough-and-tumble play was associated with same-sex peer acceptance and teachers’ ratings of social competence. **Interestingly, however, boys’ rough-and-tumble play with mixed-sex peers was negatively associated with peer acceptance and teachers’ ratings of social competence.**

### Physical Play during school recess is not necessary
* Thus, in their review of this area, Pellegrini & Bohn (2005) conclude that ‘unstructured breaks from demanding cognitive tasks seem to facilitate school learning, as well as more general social competence and adjustment to school.
*  In a study of 5-9-year-olds’ playground behaviour, Pellegrini, Huberty & Jones (1995) found that children’s attentiveness improved after recess, **but physical activity did not seem to play an important role in this, as recess with limited opportunity for physical activity was found to have the same effect.** 
* Similarly, in a year-long study of playground games with rules (ball games, chase, and jumping or singing games) during 5-6-year-old children’s first year in school, they concluded that it was the social interaction with peers during recess that was linked to school success, in terms of academic outcomes. 


### Conclusions about Physical Play

* The evidence base for conclusions on physical play is not extensive. 
* There is good evidence that physically active play provides **children with exercise and the consequent health benefits**
* there seems to be reasonable evidence associating physical play of various kinds with academic progress and cognitive self-regulation, and with social competence; 
	* • there is some evidence that, for boys, rough-and-tumble play supports the development of their social competence and emotional awareness and has possible indirect effects on academic progress; 
* there is evidence that unstructured breaks from cognitive tasks improve learning and attention, though it is unclear whether physical play contributes to this effect beyond simply taking a break and, for example, talking with friends.



## **Play with objects**

* This second type of play, which is also widely observed in primates, concerns children’s developing explorations of the world and the objects they find within it.
* Play with objects begins as soon as infants can grasp and hold on to them; early investigative behaviours include mouthing/biting, rotating while looking, rubbing/stroking, hitting and dropping.
* From around 18-24 months, toddlers begin to arrange objects, which gradually develops into sorting and classifying activities. By the age of 4 years, building, making and constructing behaviours emerge
* First, it is in play with objects that it is claimed that young children start to develop their representational abilities. 
* Second, Vygotsky also argued that play of this type is particularly related to the development of thinking, reasoning and problem-solving strategies.


### Object play and problem-solving


* In a study with 4-year-olds, for example, Smith & Dutton (1979) reported data showing that for some types of problem-solving, play experience and instruction can be equally effective, but for more challenging problems requiring creative and innovative approaches, play with objects appeared to be superior as a learning context, compared to instructional approaches.


### Object play and language


* Ungerer & Sigman (1984), for example, carried out an observational longitudinal study of play with toys with infants aged 13.5 and 22 months. At the younger age, playing with objects in a conventional, functional way predicted language scores at 22 months, but at 22 months only pretend play with objects related to language. 
* An earlier observational study by Pellegrini (1980) with 5 to 6-year-olds also showed a similar pattern, with the amount of construction play children engaged in being significantly correlated with their pre-reading, language and writing abilities, but not as strongly as their pretend play.
* The results in both studies showed that the children wrote with greater engagement and enthusiasm, and higher levels of creativity, after play with objects experiences (in which there was also, however, a clear pretence element) than when they did not have this opportunity. 


### Play with objects, math and spatial abilities



* Nath & Szücs (2014), in a study with 7-year olds, have also recently reported a positive relationship between abilities on a LEGO construction task and children’s mathematics performance (although, as this is a correlation, no causal relationship can be imputed)


### Conclusions about object play

* theoretical arguments have been developed, and have been supported by some empirical studies, linking play with objects with the development of representational abilities, reasoning and problem-solving strategies; 
* a range of studies have provided reasonable evidence of links between play with objects with the development of language, maths and spatial skills; 
* however, while some points have been established, some results are contradictory, and the usual range of methodological limitations of small or purely correlational studies are present. It is also the case that, overwhelmingly, studies of play with objects have been with young children under the age of 7 years.


## **Symbolic play**

* We now come to types of play which are engaged in only by humans, mainly because they rely on our incomparable symbolic representational abilities. 
* The first of the types, which we are referring to as symbolic play, concerns play with the various symbolic representational systems we use to make and communicate meaning. For this reason, an alternative name for this type of play might be ‘semiotic’ play. 
* This type of play emerges in children from around the age of 12 months when they first begin to intentionally use sounds to convey meaning (although it could be argued that they play with sounds, in babbling, much earlier and also with gestures, which are used to convey meaning during the first year of life) 


### Symbolic play and language

* We begin with play with language and its impact on early literacy, as this is the most researched area and the only one which has merited a significant review, namely that by Christie & Roskos (2006) 
* They cite, for example:
* evidence that infants and toddlers frequently play with the sounds of language, including repeating strings of words containing related sounds, exploring both rhyme and alliteration (Weir, 1976, pp. 610-611)
* findings that children’s knowledge of nursery rhymes and the frequency that they engage in word play were both strong predictors of children’s phonological awareness (Fernandez Fein & Baker, 1997). 
* • the many research-based strategies for promoting phonological awareness in preschool and kindergarten use playful activities such as singing songs, reciting nursery rhymes, reading books that play with the sounds of language, and game-like activities (e.g., Adams, Foorman, Lundberg, & Beeler, 1998)
* In a very recent study, Burrell & Beard (2016) have also reported a qualitative analysis to show that 9-11-year old children play with language in writing as well as in speech. Three empirical studies have been carried out, however, that do appear to provide evidence to support a link specifically between language play and literacy development more generally.
* However, each of these studies has its limitations arising from the lack of comparison groups or the inability of correlations to establish the direction of causality.


### Musical play

* In relation to musical play, for example, it is a common observation that children sing, dance and delight in exploring and making sounds of all kinds, with their own bodies and with all kinds of objects. 
* Trevarthen (see Malloch & Trevarthen, 2009), for example, has demonstrated the ‘musicality’ of early infant-mother interactions and argued for the importance of the infant’s innate response to rhythm and sounds in establishing early communicative abilities. 
* Kirschner & Tomasello (2010) showed that the prosocial behaviour (helping each other and co-operating) of a group of 5-6-year old children who took part in a musical play activity improved to a significantly greater extent than that of a group who took part in non-musical play. 
* More recently, Zachariou & Whitebread (2015) have shown in an observational study of 6-year-old children that engagement in musical play allowed self regulatory behaviours to emerge. However, it is not clearly established that the musical play activities, as such, promoted self-regulation, or merely allowed the children to use abilities they already possessed.


### Play drawing and writing

* The final aspect of symbolic or semiotic play to be significantly theorised and researched concerns children’s drawing. Like language and musical play, play with mark-making and drawing is ubiquitous in the behaviour of children across cultures, and is widely accepted as an important way in which children, even before they are literate, record their experiences and express their ideas.
* Vygotsky (1986) himself pointed out the very close links between early drawing and writing which is very commonly observed in young children’s mark-making.
* Thomas & Silk (1990) and Cox (1992), for example, pioneered work of this kind. Ring (2010) documents very persuasively the role of drawing as a tool for children to make meaning from their experiences and their worlds, and argues passionately and persuasively for the importance of continuous provision for playful drawing in early years educational settings. 


### Conclusions about symbolic play
* it seems reasonable to hypothesise that play with symbolic systems will help develop those systems; however, this is a relatively neglected and weak area of play research as regards the impact of play on children’s development; 
* there is reasonably good evidence that language play enhances children’s language development in a variety of ways; this is important, as there is reasonably good evidence that language development has relations with other important skills and outcomes, including self-regulation (Vallatton & Ayoub, 2011) and school achievement (Hoff, E, 2013);
* there is some evidence that musical play might be significant in relation to the development of communication skills, and there is some evidence that it is related to higher cognitive functioning, and can be used for self-regulation (Winsler, Ducenne & Koury, 2011).


## **Pretend play**


* Pretend play is the type of play which has been researched most extensively. In a recent review paper, Lillard, Lerner, Hopkins, Dore, Smith & Palmquist (2013) identified and critiqued 154 studies of pretend play relations with children’s learning and development in various areas. The authors conclude that: 
* pretend play is one way of developing children’s reasoning skills, but there are other ways of achieving the same result that are just as effective;
* pretend play may be a way of developing children’s social skills and awareness of others’ minds (‘Theory of Mind’) but the evidence is mixed or unsatisfactory;
* pretend play could be crucial to the development of language, narrative skills and emotion regulation, but the evidence is very limited and more research is needed;
* There is little to no evidence that pretend play helps to develop children’s creativity, intelligence, problem-solving, or self-regulation and executive functioning.


### Learning in pretence and real contexts 



* One study, investigating children’s ability to learn new information in pretence and real contexts, and directly addressing some of the methodological concerns expressed by Lillard et al., has been published by some of the authors involved in this original review (Hopkins, Dore & Lillard, 2015). 
* Intriguingly, when subsequently presented with a set of three objects, including the original objects and two others, children in the pretend condition were more likely to extend the pretend label to novel objects similar in appearance to the substitute used during the pretence episode, but children in the real condition were more likely to apply the pretend label only to the identical object used during the learning episode.


### Pretend play and creativity

* We found three studies that addressed the relation between pretend play and creativity.
* As a measure of creativity, children were asked to provide endings to stories and to make drawings, both of which were rated for creativity by the experimenters. Children who engaged in more elaborate role play – particularly involving imaginary friends and pretend identities – scored significantly higher for creativity in their narratives. 
* Wallace and Russ (2015) looked at how pretend play predicted the creativity of 31 privately educated girls over a four-year period, from when the girls were between 5 and 10 years old to when they were between 9 and 14 years old. Pretend play was assessed using the Affect in Play Scale, and creativity was measured with the Alternative Uses Task, where children are asked to think of different uses for common objects such as a key or a shoe. Children who were more imaginative and organised in their pretend play at the start of the study scored higher on the Alternative Uses Task four years later. 
* Both of the above studies suggest that pretend play and creativity are related, but they do not provide any evidence that pretence causes increases in children’s creativity.
* The only study found in this area to take a more experimental approach is that by Hoffmann and Russ (2016), who conducted an intervention study with a sample of 50 5 to 8-year-old girls.
* For children in the intervention group, the level of organisation and imagination in pretend play (measured using the Affect in Play Scale) improved substantially over the course of the study compared to the control group. However, there were no significant improvements in either creativity measure in the intervention group compared to the control group
* This is tentative evidence that pretend play might lead to improvements in creativity for children (or at least girls) who are less advanced in their play skills than their peers, but the fact that the result is based on a sub-sample and only one outcome measure out of two means it should be treated with caution. 


### Pretence and executive functions



* We also found four studies looking at pretend play and executive function outcomes.
* They found correlations between specific types of fantasy orientation and specific executive function measures. Thus, while children’s fantasy-related thoughts correlated with their ability to shift attention and their beliefs in fantastical entities or imaginary friends correlated with their inhibitory control, children who reported more favourite fantasy-related toys and games had lower scores for inhibitory control and working memory.
* Children’s reported proclivity to pretend to be someone or something other than themselves also did not correlate with any executive function measures. 
* Results showed that children in the fantastical play group increased in their working memory scores over the course of the intervention, whereas children in the other two groups did not. Furthermore, the children who were most fantastical and highly engaged in the play were the ones who showed most improvement. 
* These results add to earlier research by Singer (1961) and the study mentioned earlier by Manuilenko (1975), both discussed by Lillard et al., suggesting that pretence may be a strategy that children can apply to improve performance on certain executive function tasks. It could also be the case that whether such strategies are effective (and perhaps which are effective) changes with the age of the child.
* There is now evidence of a potential causal relationship between fantasy-oriented pretence and working memory development, and further indication that pretence may be a strategy that can be applied in executive function tasks.


### Pretend play and language

* Conner, Kelly-Vance, Ryalls & Friehe (2014) reported the one study we found relating pretend play to language development. 
* This involved 10 2 year olds with whom they developed an intervention which included components of reading, modeling, and positive reinforcement of language and play.
* All the children were assessed using the Play in Early Childhood Evaluation System, the Preschool Language Scale and a Vocabulary Assessment. The results showed that children who received the intervention increased pretend play, comprehension and expressive communication skills more than the comparison group.
* This study’s main contribution is to suggest that pretend play interventions are feasible with, and may have an impact upon, children as young as 2 years of age.


### Pretence and emotion regulation

* Gilpin, Brown and Pierucci (2015) measured the emotion regulation skills and fantasy orientation of 103 5-year old children using checklists and questionnaires, and found that the two measures were correlated. This finding slightly expands the previous correlational finding of Shields and Cicchetti (1997), discussed by Lillard et al., in that it shows that there is a specific correlation with fantasy orientation in addition to pretence behaviour in general.


### Pretence and social development


* In one very recent study in Hong Kong, Fung & Cheng (2017) have reported evidence related to pretend play and social development.
* Children’s pre- and post-training social competences were assessed, using the Peer Interactive Play Rating Scales, by two assistant teachers who did not take part in the play training. Results revealed a trend that girls who participated in the pretend play training tended to be less disruptive during peer interactions after the training than those who participated in non-pretend play, while boys benefited equally from the two play activities.
* Qu, Shen, Chee & Chen, (2015) conducted the one study we found relating to Theory of Mind (ToM). They randomly assigned 71 5-year-old kindergartners in Singapore to three groups: free play, socio-dramatic play or socio-dramatic play + ToM coaching. Each condition included four weekly sessions of 45 minutes. Before and after the training, children’s ToM, language and executive functioning were measured. The results showed that socio-dramatic play positively predicted children’s gains in ToM, and that teachers’ ToM-related guidance during socio-dramatic play and children’s pretest executive functioning positively predicted this effect of socio-dramatic play on children’s ToM. 


### Pretence and motivation 



* Finally, Sawyer (2017) investigated the impact of pretence on motivation. During the activity, the children in the pretend play condition demonstrated more types of self-directed speech associated with higher persistence on-task. These results indicate that framing an activity as pretence may increase children’s motivation.


### Conclusions about Pretend Play

* Here follows a revised version of the list provided at the beginning of the pretend play section in this review:
* pretend play is one way of developing children’s reasoning skills, but there are other ways of achieving the same result that are just as effective; 
* pretend play may be a way of developing children’s social skills and awareness of others’ minds (‘Theory of mind’). Most of the evidence is mixed or unsatisfactory, but there is good evidence from one recent study that pretend play may have an impact on social development; 
* pretend play could be crucial to the development of language, narrative skills and emotion regulation, but the evidence is very limited and more research is needed; • there are differences in the quality of learning and applications of learning when children learn in pretence versus non-pretence contexts; 
* there is some good new evidence that pretend play – and particularly fantasy oriented pretence – may relate to learning-to-learn skills such as executive function and self-regulation;
* There is very tentative evidence for a link between pretence and motivation.


## **Games with rules**

* Young children are strongly motivated by the need to make sense of their world and, as part of this, they are very interested in rules. From a very young age children begin to enjoy games with rules, and to invent their own. These include physical games such as chasing games, hide-and-seek, throwing and catching etc.
* As children mature, electronic and computer games, and the whole variety of sporting activities emerge.
* As well as helping children to develop their understandings about rules, the main developmental contribution of playing games derives from their essentially social nature. While playing games with their friends, siblings and parents, it has been argued that young children are learning a range of social skills related to sharing, taking turns, understanding others’ perspectives and so on.
* The most frequently occurring outcome reported for games for learning was knowledge acquisition, while entertainment games addressed a broader range of affective, behaviour change, perceptual and cognitive and physiological outcomes.
* Future research on digital games would benefit from a systematic programme of experimental work, examining in detail which game features are most effective in promoting engagement and supporting learning.
* DeVries (2006) has reviewed Piaget’s seminal contribution to the analysis of children’s games, particularly his analysis of stages in their play with marbles, and his proposals concerning their contribution to social and moral development. She also reviews her subsequent analyses, based on observations of children playing ‘Guess-which-hand-the-penny-is-in’ and ‘Tic-Tac-Toe’ suggesting that the former supports children’s ability to take the perspective of another, and the latter to be flexible in their use of strategies. She concludes by arguing that, in broad agreement with Piaget’s view, playing games with rules supports aspects of children’s social-moral and intellectual development.


### Games and socio-cultural development

* Two other largely theoretical papers are worth mentioning. Oren (2008) outlines the way board games can be used in child psychotherapy and gives examples of how they facilitate children’s shifting perspectives as part of the therapeutic process. Hromek & Roffey (2009), similarly, discuss the use of games during “circle time” in social and emotional learning approaches in schools.


### Board games and numbers

* There is evidence that board games involving numbers appear to help children’s number-based skills, and may lead to children having a greater interest in mathematics, perhaps because they have experienced it and its applications in a fun, relaxed context


### Playground games and social skills

* In the first category, Pellegrini, Kato, Blatchford & Baines (2002), observed 77 6-7-year-old children’s playground games for one school year in two inner-city schools. They concluded that facility with games (ball games, chase, and jumping or singing games), particularly for boys, was related to social competence with their peers and adjustment to very early schooling (as assessed by self-report and teacher ratings).
* This suggests that games with a strong social element – such as most playground games – could help children develop their social networks and a sense of belonging in the school environment.
* In a second study in this area, however, Lehrer, Petrakos & Venkatesh (2014) investigated whether time spent in unstructured play outside of school predicted 6-7-year-old children’s creativity, cognitive, social, or emotional outcomes in school, but largely produced negative results. In particular, as regards games with rules, they found no significant correlations between the amount of time children spent engaged in ‘board games and puzzles’ and any of their outcome measures.


### Games and spatial skills

* Newman, Hansen & Gutierrez (2016), on the other hand, in a study with 8-year olds, investigated the effects of playing two different games (Block building or Scrabble) on spatial ability, with pre and post-tests involving a computerised mental rotation test with reaction time as the outcome measure, and fMRI scans. Not surprisingly, only the block play group showed significant training effects on the mental rotation test and increased activation in brain regions associated with spatial processing. However, what this tells us about the specific effects of playing games with rules is not clear. 


### Games: an untapped field of study


* The key theoretical point about games with rules, that their essentially social nature supports children’s social and moral development, has been supported, for boys at least, by one study. As regards intellectual benefits, there are 3 or 4 studies supporting some gains, over a short period of time, for aspects of numeracy. 
* Clearly the study of games with rules, particularly those not involving a computer, is very much in its infancy. At the moment the field is enjoying something of a resurgence due to the popularity of computer games, but there are no studies, as far as we are aware, of the differential effects of playing the same games on or off-screen. A vast range of un-addressed and un-answered questions therefore remain. 
* The problem-solving element in some games, with the inevitably iterative patterns of behaviour therefore induced, might support the development of mental strategy development and metacognitive review, which in turn enhances creative thinking.


### Summary

* board games (particularly those with numbers and linear number sequences) lead to improvements in numeracy/mathematics ability; 
* physical games with rules help children (and especially boys) adapt to formal schooling;
* games with rules may act as a proxy for an adult scaffolding and guiding children’s learning, while also giving the child freedom and choice in their activity.


## **Closing thoughts**

* When and how is play more effective than other contexts for learning? As outlined in the previous sections, there is evidence, among other things, that:
* physical play is linked to motor development, and some tentative evidence that it is linked to social development;
* unstructured breaks from cognitive tasks improve learning and attention, though it is unclear whether play leads to greater improvements in learning than simply taking a break and, for example, talking with friends; 
* block play leads to improvements in spatial processing/mental rotation; 
* construction play relates to language development, and this relationship may be strongest in infancy, with pretend play becoming more important for language as children enter toddlerhood; 
* word-play and word-games relate to language development; 
* pretend play relates to language development, and particularly narrative skills; • pretend play – and particularly fantasy-oriented pretence – may relate to learning-to-learn skills such as executive function and self-regulation. 
* board games (particularly those with numbers and linear number sequences) lead to improvements in numeracy/mathematics ability; 
* physical games with rules help children (and especially boys) adapt to formal schooling 

Also, to make stronger conclusions about the importance of learning through play, we need to look at studies comparing play to other learning contexts. These suggested relationships between the research on the five types of play and development, and the five characteristics, are described on the following pages.

# Characteristics of Play in the context of Learning


### Joyful and actively engaging


* Children who perceive an activity as play are more focused, attentive, motivated and show signs of higher well-being while on-task (Howard & McInnes, 2013; Sawyer, 2017) This suggests that perceiving an activity as play creates active engagement and joy, which leads to children being in the appropriate cognitive and emotional state to remain on-task and process information. 
* But in addition to this, various studies show how social interaction, meaning and iteration can also be important factors in children’s learning


### Socially interactive

* Lehrer at al. (2014) assessed whether the activities children engaged in during their unstructured time predicted their ‘adaptive skills’ (as measured on the teacher-report BASC-2 measure)
* Similarly, Pellegrini (1992) found that 5-year-old children’s level of social interaction with other children during recess predicted their school achievement, whereas their level of social interaction with teachers during recess was negatively related to their school achievement
* Playing with other children, watching them and learning from them, may be one of the ways in which playful learning exerts its effect.
* However, children can also learn from adults in playful contexts. 
*  It would therefore be behavioural problems and difficulties adapting to school that were negatively related to school achievement, rather than interactions with teachers causing a reduction in children’s school achievement 
* These results demonstrate that playful interaction with a knowledgeable adult can be a more effective context for learning than traditional teaching approaches such as completing problems in an exercise book. We can see that learning from others – both adults and children – through social interaction explains some of the ways in which playful learning can be superior to other learning approaches. 
* Furthermore, it seems possible that playing with others could also be detrimental to learning in some situations – for example if the play partner passes on false information or a deficient strategy.


### Meaningful

* The children who simply played the number board game became more interested in mathematics, and one explanation for this result is that numbers now had more meaning for them – they had found a new context in their lives in which numbers could be applied, and that context was fun!
* Dansky (1980) found that sociodramatic play led to children developing higher narrative skills than other conditions with equal adult contact, showing that social interactions with a more knowledgeable partner is not the important factor in this case. Baumer, Ferholt & Lecusay (2005) compared how pretending versus story talk influenced narrative development, and pretending led to superior outcomes.
* When pretending, a child needs to draw on their own personal experience and interests in order to generate ideas for characters and situations. Discussing a story, by contrast, can remain a relatively abstract, detached activity. 


### Iterative

* While the studies discussed above likely involved some level of iterative activity, it is difficult to know how much, and children may well engage in board games and pretend play without much repetition with-variation
* What is different about the play condition compared to the training condition in such studies? The play in this case is clearly iterative, as children would have tried out different actions with the materials and different ways of connecting the sticks.
* Therefore, these studies of object play demonstrate how the iterative nature of play can make it a more effective learning context for innovative problem-solving.
* Bonawitz et al. concluded that instruction appeared to promoteefficient learning, but at the cost of reducing children’s exploration and their likelihood of discovering novel information. In a similar vein, Ramani (2012) reported a study in which four- and five-year-old peer dyads completed a playful, flexible and child-driven building task or a more structured, adult-driven building task. 
* As predicted, the children in the playful condition It is still largely an open question as to whether children engaged in greater positive joint communication and built more complex structures than did those in the structured condition, and these differences carried over into a subsequent joint building task. Ramani concluded that cooperative problem-solving activities that allow children greater control of the task goals and interaction, similar to play contexts, appear to promote higher levels of cooperation and more effective learning and performance in young children. 
* In sum, certain studies from the existing body of research into play types and child outcomes support the hypothesis that the five characteristics of playful experiences are the main factors that facilitate learning through play. However, more research is needed to confirm this hypothesis. 
* Finally, although there is some suggestive evidence about the role of play in supporting the development of communication skills, of abstract thought, self regulation,and more adaptive, flexible, creative thinking, we still do not have conclusive evidence of causal relations.


## **What we know:**
* Perceiving an activity as the play seems to lead to higher levels of joy and active Engagement
* Social interaction during play is sometimes linked to improved learning outcomes.
* Pretending may lead to improved outcomes because children make more meaningful links to their own knowledge and experience.
* Iterative play may lead to more creative, innovative ways of thinking and problem solving.


## **What we don’t know:**
* What is the relative contribution of joy and active engagement to learning through play? Are they both required for learning to occur?
* What is it about social interaction that can improve learning outcomes? Is it the knowledge transmitted by the play partner, increases in confidence and communication skills, or something else?
* Does pretence make children create meaningful links to their own experience, compared to other learning contexts and other types of play?
* How much effect does meaning have on learning during play? Is there a large or small difference in learning if children can link material to their own experience?
* Under what conditions, if any, are the characteristics detrimental to learning? Particularly for social interaction, it seems logical that playing with an ignorant or misguided partner could lead to reduced or maladaptive learning.

# Play in Institutional Care


# Children with Chronic Conditions 

## Challenging Play Behaviours in Chronic Illness
- In addition to the somatic and psychological consequences of their illness, several factors such as isolation, stigma, inequality, bullying and doubts concerning their physical and intellectual capacities are everyday realities for children with chronic diseases that may negatively impact healthy play and development
- Being hospitalized, pain and fatigue, social isolation and the ‘other-than-normal’ treatment of diseased children are likely to compromise their play behaviour
- Health care professionals primarily focus on the biological facets of treatment success, and may be less inclined to address the effects of disease on patients’ daily routine and self-perceptionn. 
- **Any source of stress can compromise well-being**
	- This includes hospitalization and treatment regimes to social challenges and physical limitations
	- Interruption of daily routines, an unfamiliar environment, strange and frightening equipment, and feelings of a lack of control may increase stress in children, leasing to trauma, when in hospitals
        * serious chronic illness can have detrimental effects on school attendance, relations with peers at school and school engagement

## Play as a tool to improve outcomes in chronic illness

- Optimal strategies, incorporating diverse methodologies such as very early interventions, play therapies, gaming and interactive technology, aimed at improving well-being and quality of life in this population are much needed
- From a therapeutic perspective, play as intervention is valuable because play
	- regulates negative affect and diminishes stress
	- facilitates coping with adverse events
	- is useful for processing new information both cognitively and emotionally by allowing for order and integration
	- is a safe way to practice new behaviour and experiment with solutions
	- stimulates fantasy and creative (divergent) thinking
	- stimulates the development of empathy 

## Treatment potential of game technology
Recent studies have used applied games to successfully decrease anxiety or depressive symptoms in adolescents

### Games influence behaviour in children

- Playing games can influence social, emotional and cognitive development. The immersive social context of today’s games help gamers rapidly learn social skills and pro-social behaviour
- playing a prosocial game was shown to induce long-lasting enhancements in e.g. helping, cooperation, empathy and emotional awareness 
- individuals who had played a cooperative game showed more prosocial behaviour in a dilemma task than players who had played competitively, suggesting that these behaviours might be transferable to their peer and family relations outside the gaming environment
- Little is known about the long-term effects of gaming on emotions and mood, although there are reasons to think that gaming may be positive for an individual’s growth and social connection
- Regular games can be used to motivate and engage patients in physical activity and therapy as well
- Games also have the potential to enhance mental health and wellbeing in children and adolescents

#### Video games 
-  Playing video games can enhance problem solving skills and creativity and, mostly action games, have a positive impact on focus and spatial skills
- In addition, a recent study on the consequences of playing video games, identified positive outcome for intellectual functioning, competence in reading, mathematics, spelling and academic achievement
        * On the one hand, games can be used to distract patients and help them to cope with the side effects of treatments, like nausea, vomiting, anxiety, fatigue and pain, much the same as physical play does
        * Computer games may have the same effect as an often more expensive relaxation training.
        * Applied games could be combined with patient-tailored tools to assess a patient’s wellbeing in dedicated e-health platforms to deliver personalized interventions

# Play Assessment:
- A paper that studied the interplay of play and cognition[^3], used 
	- Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 2nd edition (BSID-II; Bayley, 1993). We used the BSID-II to assess children’s general cognitive development. 
	* Play assessment: used two toy sets to assess play. 
	    * The first consisted of exploratory toys comparable to those donated to the institutions. 
	    * The second set consisted primarily of symbolic toys to provide sufficient opportunity to elicit the children’s symbolic play behaviours.
