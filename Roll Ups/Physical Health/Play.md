# Play Therapy 
# Play Therapy
-   When freedom is provided within structure, children feel encouraged to explore strategies, and this helps children develop confidence and self-efficacy which leads to healthy outcomes including reduction of anxiety and inculcation of more positive behaviors.
- Play therapy capitalizes on such therapeutic powers of play or changing mechanisms within play and considers its strategic use through trained professionals within therapeutic contexts to promote specific therapeutic outcomes.
    

## Definition of Play Therapy
- an interpersonal process wherein a trained therapist systematically applies the curative powers of play to help the clients resolve their current psychological difficulties and help prevent future ones.
- Play therapy or play-based interventions are widely used to facilitate communication between therapist and children and to help children’s understanding of event
-  Used for planning intervention with children

## Therapeutic Factors involved in Play
- Self expression
- Access to Subconcious
- Abreaction
- Catharsis
- Sublimation
- Competence and self control
- Creative problem solving
- Fantasy compensation
- Behavioral rehearsal
- Reality testing and more.
    
## Major Approaches to Play Therapy
    
### Psychoanalytic Play Therapy
- Thus, psychoanalytic play therapist helps children to discover themselves and makes them to assume more responsibilities for their life
- uses play therapy techniques to provide a developmentally appropriate intervention for relationally traumatized children
- Thus, psychoanalytic play therapist helps children to discover themselves and makes them to assume more responsibilities for their life
- Within this relationship, therapist works on the negative internal working model and challenges child to modify the maladaptive object relations in healthy directions
- For children who suffer from chronic illness or disabilities
- Time consuming
    

### Object Relation Thematic Play therapy
    
- Object relations play therapy is a relational, developmental approach to young children grounded in attachment‑based object relations theory
- most effective when used with children who have experienced relational trauma such as abuse, family violence, and disrupted attachment in their life as early as 5 years

### Cognitive-behavioural play therapy
- single parent or both the parents are taught effective ways of conducting nondirective play sessions with their children 
- Through the use of play, cognitive change is communicated indirectly, and adaptive coping skills are demonstrated through the modeling component. This therapy is highly effective in enhancing parent–child relationship
- successful with oppositional behaviors, relationship problems, and traumatic events by strengthening parent–child relationship.
- Here, the focus of play therapist is more on psychopathology rather than personality development
- brief, structured, problem‑oriented, and directive in nature and emphasis on the involvement of children in the treatment process and to take the responsibilities for their expected behavioral changes.

### Fair Play Therapy
    
### Narrative Therapy
- Therapist actively involves in the play and focus on give and take, at times leading and at times following and even at times, taking the relatively passive role of observer/interpreter
- used in play therapy as a way of helping children express and explore their experiences of life.
- Children become aware of and expected to be more responsible for the consequences of his/her behavior
    

### Prescriptive play therapy
- This approach enables the therapists to help children communicate their difficult experiences and complex emotions through co‑constructed stories.

* EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICACY
* As a result of external and internal pressure to present evidence of psychotherapy treatment, the American Psychological Association (APA) Division 12 Task Force on Promotion and Dissemination of Psychological Procedures issued the first major list of empirically supported treatments in 1995 (Chorpita, 2003
* The most articulated controversy regarding the identification of evidence-based treatments or empirically supported treatments, however, is the possible distinction between clinical trials and real-world interventions: efficacy versus effectiveness. 
* and comparison of the intervention to a placebo or another treatment. Currently, this website lists four major types of disorders, including anxiety disorders, depression, attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder, and conduct/oppositional problems. Several of the listed disorders identify no Best Support or Promising treatments, indicating the need for additional research on these and other diagnoses.
* that currently no play therapy approaches are considered by Division 53 as Best Support or Promising.


* _EFFECTIVENESS OF PLAY THERAPY_
* the strength of play therapy research appears to be in the history of and continued ability to conduct successful play therapy studies in natural real-world settings of schools, hospitals, clinics, and shelters
* Although conducting research in the school setting presents the researcher with difficulties in controlling research groups and facilitating treatment as dictated by a protocol, it offers the
* practitioner a practical method for replicating treatment if it is discovered that treatment was effective
* As evidenced by the play therapy research, researchers have attempted to provide services to a large number of children, including criteria such as, for example, “children who are identified by parents and/or teachers as exhibiting behavioral problems
* This broader inclusion pattern allows the researcher to serve children who are experiencing problems but possibly not identified with a specific diagnosis or not exhibiting only criteria tied to a specific diagnosis. Although
* Treatment provided in school-setting studies can be replicated and provided by a full-time counselor, psychologist, or social worker in the public school setting
* several studies cited with children in hospital settings were conducted with children receiving other hospital services who might benefit from a play therapy treatment provided by hospital staff to reduce their anxiety
* Shelters are perhaps the most difficult settings in which to conduct research, yet Kot et al
* Brandt (2001) demonstrated the impact of play therapy on children who received services from a mental health clinic that served clients of low income and education level.
* Additional strengths of play therapy research include the ability to demonstrate effectiveness with younger age groups and diverse populations
* Play therapy researchers have sought to investigate play not only as a developmental intervention, but also as a universal language for children. Garza and Bratton (2005) demonstrated the positive effects of play therapy on problem behaviors for a sample of all Hispanic children, mostly identified as Mexican American
* Trostle (1988) found that after 10 sessions of nondirective group play therapy, bilingual Puerto Rican children showed significant improvement in self-control and higher developmental level play behaviors when compared to their control group peer.
* Research in play therapy has shown effectiveness in natural settings, with younger children, and with diverse groups of children
* There are few other interventions that can boast a lengthy history of research with consistent positive results across a variety of populations and presenting problems.


* _EFFICACY OF PLAY THERAPY_
* The meta-analyses have helped the intervention of play therapy move toward the goal of efficacy. Chambless and Hollon (1998) provided a comprehensive description of efficacy to demonstrate that treatment benefits are due to the effects of the treatment and not to chance or confounding factors such as passage of time, effects of psychological assessment, or presence of different types of clients in the various treatment conditions
* Sound methodology includes, but is not limited to, specificity in sample population description, selection of instruments that measure the specific focus of the population, follow up methods, assessment of clinical significance, use of treatment manuals, monitoring of treatment protocol, and credible data analysis. Efficacy can be established through group design methods or single-case experiments.
* play therapy researchers can attempt to address issues noted by the narrow definitions of efficacy in order to strengthen the efficacy base of play therapy.
* there appeared to exist three main criteria in which play therapy research has not aligned itself with the psychotherapy research on efficacy: manualization of treatment, specificity of population, and replication of studies.


* _MANUALIZATION OF TREATMENT_
* Possibly, play therapists have hesitated in using manuals because of the need to respond to each client as needed, but manuals are not required to be step-by-step outlines of session 
* manuals can describe “broad principles and phases of treatment with examples of interventions consistent with these notions 
* This type of manual allows the play therapy researcher to define treatment according to theoretical principles and offer specific interventions to describe those principles, but it also allows for freedom in meeting the needs of the client through the principles outlined in the manual
* Adherence to treatment is a critical piece of conducting solid research, and it has been shown that without monitoring, researchers will drift from manualized treatments
* The use of trained observers who establish an acceptable level of inter-rater reliability to observe random sessions ensures that research protocol is being followed and is indeed responsible for outcome changes


* _SPECIFICITY IN SAMPLE POPULATION DESCRIPTION_
* Play therapy research has greatly improved in the reporting of sex, age, ethnicity, and other distinguishing characteristics, yet improvement has not been made in the area of distinguishing presenting problems and symptoms.
* Although limiting to the number who can participate in research and the number of children who are served, identifying specific problems and examining only those problems will help build efficacy research in play therapy. This can be accomplished through the identification of DSM-IV diagnoses in children, then measuring the impact of play therapy on those diagnose 
* Hence, it is recommended that play therapy researchers attempt to study the effects of play therapy on grouped behaviors, such as hyperactivity, depressive problems, and anxiety problem
* Instead of measuring problematic behavior of children according to the total problems score on the CBCL, a researcher could simply identify children who score borderline or clinically significant on the subscale of attention problems or aggressive problems. 
* Creating specificity in play therapy research helps the field to acknowledge how effective play therapy is with specific presenting problems. 

* _REPLICATION OF PLAY THERAPY STUDIES_
* At this juncture, replication with loose research definitions and parameters is not particularly beneficial to the play therapy research.
* Although play therapy does not have to meet these stringent requirements to be considered promising, best support treatments are marked by their manualization, specification of sample, and replication of results.
* The field of psychotherapy has pressured the field of play therapy to prove its worth.

* _CONCLUSION_
* Play therapy has been demonstrated to improve the self-concepts of children, decrease anxious behaviors, lessen externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors, and increase social adjustment.
* An overall summarization of play therapy research over 60 years provides evidence that play therapy has a large beneficial treatment effect over comparison or nontreatment groups. Specific research studies are cited and reviewed in this chapter to reveal the overall impact of play therapy intervention
* The strength of play therapy research lies in its application to real-world settings that validate play therapy as a usable model in working with real clients.
