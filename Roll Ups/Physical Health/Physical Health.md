# Rights Bases Approach to Health 
[^1]
According to the Kenyan Government, health needs to take a rights based approach
- Every child shall have equal rights, opportunities and responsibilities as any other child and shall be protected from all forms of discrimination.
- Every child shall have access to relevant health information, knowledge and skills that are appropriate for their age, gender, culture, language and context.
- Every child has a right to quality education. Access to education will continue to be facilitated for vulnerable groups (girls, orphans, children with disabilities and special needs).
- Children are the most vulnerable members of our society by virtue of their age and stage of growth. Therefore, their rights should be safeguarded and protected.
- The four key pillars of child rights as articulated in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and as enshrined in the Kenya Children Act 2001. These include:
  
#### Survival rights:
- These include:
	- Adequate measures shall be put in place to provide both preventive and curative medical care for all children.
	- Feeding programmes shall be established and food supplements given to the vulnerable children especially those living in poverty and marginalized areas.
  
#### Developmental rights:

- To ensure that these rights are practised or respected we shall ensure that:
	- The IEC programme shall be developed and used to inculcate the importance of play and leisure for the continued holistic growth and development of th echild.
  
#### Protection rights:
- The following shall be assured:
	- Stringent enforcement of the existing protection measures against drug abuse by reinforcing the relevant section of the Children Act 2001
	- Provision of awareness campaigns on dangers of drug and substance abuse
	- Accessible and affordable rehabilitation and rescue centres for children in conflict with the law including those who abuse drugs

	- Peer education programme will be critical to improve effective communication.
	- Schools and the community shall plan and implement education programmes that promote positive socio-cultural behaviour among children
	- The school shall have adequate provisions for guidance and counselling services.
  
#### Participation Rights :

- Children are entitled to the freedom to express opinions and to have a say in matters affecting their social, economic, religious, cultural and political life.
    - Participation rights include the right to express opinions and be heard, the right to information and freedom of association.
    - Respecting these rights as they mature helps children bring about the realization of all their rights and prepares them for an active role in society.
    - As such school children shall be allowed to actively participate in all appropriate fora to express their opinions in matters affecting their health and education

## Indian Rights Guaranteed
- The constitution of India article 15 guarantee special attention to children through necessary and special laws in policies that safeguard their rights
  - The directive principles of State policy in India says the state shall endeavor to achieve social and economic welfare of the people by guarding the children against exploitation and moral degradation
- National commission for protection of child rights march set up in 2007 ensure the policies programs and administrative mechanisms are in consonance with the child rights perspectives
- The ICPS 2009 centrally sponsored scheme of women and child development to provide a safe and secure environment for children so that they do not become vulnerable to exploitation, neglect and abuse.
- The spirit of all declaration goes beyond physical health of a child and talks about his overall being. The concept of well being is very important in a program for child health.
