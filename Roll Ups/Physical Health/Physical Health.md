Problems in institutional settings

# Current realities in institutional settings
In a literature review conducted for a study on morbidity in preschool children in institutions in Kenya, we find out that [^3]
- Prevailing conditions in orphanages may predispose children to increased prevalence of malnutrition and infectious diseases like diarrhoea and respiratory tract infections. Unavailability of safe and nutritious foods in orphanage set up and access to safewater are likely to lead to increase levels of malnutrition among children. (Page 22) 
- However, studies have established that most caregivers lack nutrition awareness and that once a child reaches preschool age, caregivers divert their attention from the children to other matters and care giving becomes a secondary issue. Thus, the nutrition needs are neglected (Mile,Milena and Biljana, 2013). (Page 26)
- Child malnutrition is associated with susceptibility to infection and as a result many children are more likely to be prone to common childhood ailments such as diarrhoea and respiratory infections; and for those who survive, frequent illness affects their nutrition status due to lowered resistance to infections (Page 27)
- Various studies have shown that illness among children in orphanages is higher (30%) especially diarrheal disease compared with 7 % in non-orphanage children. It has also been shown that more boys are usually stunted with high morbidity rates than girls (Page 28)
- In a study carried out in Botswana (Misra & Bignami, 2008) it was found that children in orphanages were 49% more likely to be underweight than non-orphanage children. The findings concurred with those of Lindblade et al. (2003) in Malawi where it was demonstrated that the prevalence of malnutrition in children in orphanages (below 6 years old) was 55% compared with 30% of non-orphanage children. (Page 29)
- According to the American Academy of Pediatrics[^4], in reference to the foster care system
	- 30% to 80% of children come into foster care with at least 1 medical problem,and one-third have a chronic medical condition.
	- Early childhood trauma/toxic stress, especially if frequent or unremitting and not tempered by responsive, nurturing care giving, adversely affects the neurobiology of the developing brain.
	- Up to 80% of children and adolescents enter with a significant mental health need, and almost 40% have significant oral health issues.
	- Approximately 60% of children younger than 5 years have developmental health issues.
- [^5]According to a large-scale literature review on institutional care conducted by the University of Delaware, relative to their peers, they show atypically short height, low weight, and small head circumference (Page 6)
- According to a study on moribidity profile of 100 orphaned children in Southern India[^6]
	- Deprivation of parental care and, often, food, education, and medical care experienced by children. Studies often report that lack of parental care and denial of a secure family life, coupled with congested and often unhygienic living conditions, affect orphan children adversely.
	- Research identifies the risks of orphanage care that may broadly be classified as:
	  - Infectious morbidity,
	  - Nutrition and growth,
	  - Cognitive development,
	  - Socio-affective development
	- Physical and sexual abuse in the institution, all of which are more during infancy and early years of life.
	- Poor utilisation of healthcare facilities:
	  - Hospital care was sought for very few cases. This is of concern since most of the morbidities in children are accompanied by frequent complications, thereby increasing the morbidity burden further.
	  - Treatment seeking practices were found to be unsatisfactory with predominance of self treatment or using drugs without prescription either from local RMPs or upon pharmacists' advice.
	  - Orphanage staff may not be trained to identify development of danger signs which may pose grave risks to the children.
	- Lack of proper certified and approved measurement tools. The uncertainty abounding in the efficiency of these organisations, especially in third world countries, have led researchers to devise proxy indicators for estimating efficiency and quality through assessment of health status, among other indicators, of the residents. Valid measures, required for planning promotional measures for the welfare of orphaned children, requires reliable data on their health and nutrition status. Such data was grossly deficient from different parts of the country, more so from South India.
- According to Rainbow Homes, street children are at a higher risk for health concerns[^2]
	- Homelessness is a significant predictor of health status.
	- Yuva studies show that children on the streets have higher incidence of trauma related injuries, development delays, sinusitis, anaemia and asthma, eczema, visual and neurological deficits as well as other disabilities.
	- Hunger and malnutrition is very common. They are undernourished and stunted
	- Run away youth are its significant risk violence and victimisation substance abuse pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases
	- They do not have access to comprehensive health services immunization routine child health surveillance and health promotion.
	- Studies on Street children in India show that the children experience high rates of physical emotional and mental health problems
	- Their intake of food is inadequate and the quality of food is poor.
	- In many cases they have sexually transmitted infections mental health status is unknown depression and society and low self esteem or very common


### Common Infections:

- **Skin Infections:** Skin infections were reported most commonly followed by common cold and fever. A previous study done on orphans in the Southern state of Tamil Nadu similarly reported high prevalence of skin infections including pediculosis (25%) and oro-dental problems including dental caries (50%).
- **Eye Infections:** Infections of the eye were the lowest in prevalence. Similar prevalence of ear conditions was also reported. They however, also reported ophthalmic problems including Bitots spots which we did not find in our population.
- **Diarrheal disease and Respiratory Infections:** Some studies done on children residing in urban slums where prevalence of diarrheal disease and respiratory infections has been reported to be higher than our population

# Rights Bases Approach to Health 
[^1]
According to the Kenyan Government, health needs to take a rights based approach
- Every child shall have equal rights, opportunities and responsibilities as any other child and shall be protected from all forms of discrimination.
- Every child shall have access to relevant health information, knowledge and skills that are appropriate for their age, gender, culture, language and context.
- Every child has a right to quality education. Access to education will continue to be facilitated for vulnerable groups (girls, orphans, children with disabilities and special needs).
- Children are the most vulnerable members of our society by virtue of their age and stage of growth. Therefore, their rights should be safeguarded and protected.
- The four key pillars of child rights as articulated in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and as enshrined in the Kenya Children Act 2001. These include:
  
#### Survival rights:
- These include:
	- Adequate measures shall be put in place to provide both preventive and curative medical care for all children.
	- Feeding programmes shall be established and food supplements given to the vulnerable children especially those living in poverty and marginalized areas.
  
#### Developmental rights:

- To ensure that these rights are practised or respected we shall ensure that:
	- The IEC programme shall be developed and used to inculcate the importance of play and leisure for the continued holistic growth and development of th echild.
  
#### Protection rights:
- The following shall be assured:
	- Stringent enforcement of the existing protection measures against drug abuse by reinforcing the relevant section of the Children Act 2001
	- Provision of awareness campaigns on dangers of drug and substance abuse
	- Accessible and affordable rehabilitation and rescue centres for children in conflict with the law including those who abuse drugs
	- Provision of specialized staff in children institutions to detect and deal with drugs and substance abuse
	- Affordable specialized medical care for children addicted to drugs and other substance
	- Awareness campaign and information on the dangers of sexual exploitation
	- Provision of free medical treatment for all sexually abused children
	- Measures to discourage negative cultural beliefs and practices that support child marriages, child labour and Female Genital Mutilation
	- Life skills shall be part of the school curriculum
	- Peer education programme will be critical to improve effective communication.
	- Schools and the community shall plan and implement education programmes that promote positive socio-cultural behaviour among children
	- The school shall have adequate provisions for guidance and counselling services.
  
#### Participation Rights :

- Children are entitled to the freedom to express opinions and to have a say in matters affecting their social, economic, religious, cultural and political life.
    - Participation rights include the right to express opinions and be heard, the right to information and freedom of association.
    - Respecting these rights as they mature helps children bring about the realization of all their rights and prepares them for an active role in society.
    - As such school children shall be allowed to actively participate in all appropriate fora to express their opinions in matters affecting their health and education

## Declaration on child rights by the UN [^2]
Articles in the UN convention on the rights of the child relevant to the health of a child
- Article 2: a mentally or physically disabled child should enjoy a full and decent life in conditions which ensure your dignity promote self reliance and facility to child active participation in the community
- Article 24 the right of any child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health
- Article 25 the right of a child placed by competent authorities for the purposes of care protection of treatment of his or her physical or mental health to a periodic review of the treatment provided to the child
- Article 39 all appropriate measures to be taken to promote the physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of a child victim of any form of abuse and neglect

## Indian Rights Guaranteed
- The constitution of India article 15 guarantee special attention to children through necessary and special laws in policies that safeguard their rights
  - The directive principles of State policy in India says the state shall endeavor to achieve social and economic welfare of the people by guarding the children against exploitation and moral degradation
- National commission for protection of child rights march set up in 2007 ensure the policies programs and administrative mechanisms are in consonance with the child rights perspectives
- The ICPS 2009 centrally sponsored scheme of women and child development to provide a safe and secure environment for children so that they do not become vulnerable to exploitation, neglect and abuse.
- The spirit of all declaration goes beyond physical health of a child and talks about his overall being. The concept of well being is very important in a program for child health.
- Children and young people need to develop healthy lifestyles and opportunities to achieve optimum health and well-being. This is a collective responsibility.

# Models of Health Care- An International and Domestic Comparison

## Global Comparison of Health Standards in Residential Care 

Rainbow[^2] Homes has documented different national standards for children in institutional care across multiple countries 
### India
- No documented protocols on health standards for children in India. 
- In India we have to have to build standards with specific understanding of children were homeless when developing health protocols for them. Set of underpinning principles on which services should be based as well as outline some key standards that need to be implemented

### Australia
  - Standard 4- each child and young person has an individualized plan that details the health education and other needs
  - Standard 5 -children and young people have their physical development psychosocial and mental health needs assessed and attended to in a timely way.
  - Health record relevant health information that is in a consolidated form that documents the child or young person state of health and identified needs.
  - Luminary help check to establish the ongoing relationship between child care and the primary health provider. 
  - Physical health development till and psychosocial and mental health domains is to be assessed. To ensure care and enable support of both the child in carer overtime.

### UK
- Should have a holistic health assessment on entering care
  - Assessment should be done by a suitably qualified medical practitioner
  - First assessment should result in a health plan and if a child has been already assist the new assessment should be to update based on the child change circumstance
  - Attention should be given to the continuity of previous plans and interventions
  - All health staff with information about child health should ensure that this is made available to the person undertaking the assessment as soon as possible
  - Health assessment needs to be a continuous process not an isolated event. It needs to have a flexible approach appropriate to the child and stage of development
  - Health plan should clearly set out objectives actions timescales responsibilities are arising from the health assessment
  - Health plan needs to be reviewed in line with statutory requirement timescale
  - health assessments must be taken twice a year annually for children and young people under five years
  - Balance the sensitive and confidential nature of the child and young persons health information

## Models of Care in Indian institutions

Rainbow[^2] Homes has documented different institutional standards for other domestic service providers to CNCP in India

### Health models in Sneh Ghars Delhi
- Coordinated by centre for equity studies there on homes for children in Delhi Hyderabad and Bengaluru.
- Homes in Delhi are in partnership with the Delhi government. It provides infrastructure NGO managers and funds the program.
- Approach is holistic balance maintained between preventive promotive and curative services
- #### Objectives
  - Ensure preventive promotive and curative physical and mental care of all children in residential care including immunization hygiene health education de addiction nutrition tracking individual and group counseling
  - Establish linkages with public and private health Care institutions and functionaries at the primary secondary and tertiary levels
  - Provide emergency curative health care support event to children on streets
  - Homes document and maintain record for each child
- #### Challenges
  - Homes given by Government are in bad condition
  - Severe constraint of space leading to health problems from overcrowding
  - They do not refuse any child Khushi entry into home does living conditions are unhygienic

### Health models in Rainbow Homes for street children Kolkata

# Health Approaches in Institutional settings
As documented by Rainbow homes [^2], there are different approaches to healthcare

### Medical approach
- heavily dependent on qualified medical practitioners services provide on a case by case basis.
- It is wasteful and over medical eyes is health issues

### Health worker approach 
- focus more on preventive and promotive aspects of health. 
- Primary needs are addressed at the level of a health worker.

### Balanced approach
- In this view all staff members are fundamentally health workers and need training
- Program should have thoroughly trained supervised supported health workers
- For health programmes, the home needs to set up a health management advisory committee including a doctor public health specialist on a voluntary basis. 
- The set up also includes Ayush Specialists to teach home health remedies
- While sitting up a help program math existing resources including friendly doctors government dispensaries health centers hospitals, information on existing government schemes like free beds.
- Maintain supportive network for reference financial aid and volunteer action
