- Children are the most vulnerable members of our society by virtue of their age and stage of growth. Therefore, their rights should be safeguarded and protected.
- The four key pillars of child rights as articulated in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and as enshrined in the Kenya Children Act 2001. These include:
