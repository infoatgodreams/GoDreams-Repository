# Health Risks of Institutional Care

# Nutrition & Growth 

## Identified Challenges

In a literature review conducted for a study on morbidity in preschool children in institutions in Kenya, we find out that [^3]
- Prevailing conditions in orphanages may predispose children to increased prevalence of malnutrition and infectious diseases like diarrhoea and respiratory tract infections. Unavailability of safe and nutritious foods in orphanage set up and access to safewater are likely to lead to increase levels of malnutrition among children. (Page 22) 
- However, studies have established that most caregivers lack nutrition awareness and that once a child reaches preschool age, caregivers divert their attention from the children to other matters and care giving becomes a secondary issue. Thus, the nutrition needs are neglected (Mile,Milena and Biljana, 2013). (Page 26)
- Child malnutrition is associated with susceptibility to infection and as a result many children are more likely to be prone to common childhood ailments such as diarrhoea and respiratory infections; and for those who survive, frequent illness affects their nutrition status due to lowered resistance to infections (Page 27)
- In a study carried out in Botswana (Misra & Bignami, 2008) it was found that children in orphanages were 49% more likely to be underweight than non-orphanage children. The findings concurred with those of Lindblade et al. (2003) in Malawi where it was demonstrated that the prevalence of malnutrition in children in orphanages (below 6 years old) was 55% compared with 30% of non-orphanage children. (Page 29)
- Prevalence of undernutrition seemed to increase significantly with an increase in length of stay in the orphanage (Page 69)
- It has also been shown that more boys are usually stunted with high morbidity rates than girls (Page 28)
- [^5]According to a large-scale literature review on institutional care conducted by the University of Delaware, relative to their peers, they show atypically short height, low weight, and small head circumference (Page 6)

## Potential Causes
- Children whose caregivers had not received any form of training on childcare practices were more likely to be underweight, wasted and stunted respectively. (Page 72)
- Consumption of meat, fruits and vegetables was low. Low consumption of fruits and vegetables could expose children to the risk of micronutrient deficiencies that take long to manifest. All children were served same quantities of food. The difference in energy intake was a result of poor appetite, illness among children as well as age. (Page 93)

## Potential Solutions
- Nutrition status (underweight) showed a positive significant relationship with institutional characteristics and dietary practices. (Page 94)
- From the study, it can be concluded that good nutrition status can be equated with appropriate childcare practices and low morbidity burden. 
- Majority of children living in orphanages in Kwale County had good nutrition status as depicted by the low levels of undernutrition. This was likely due to consumption of at least three meals per day, diversity of foods consumed, appropriate knowledge in caregiving among thecaregivers in the orphanages, favourable caregiver to child ratios, good health care practices, adequate consumption of energy and other nutrients. This was also enhanced by the effect of the low morbidity burden noted among the children. (Page 95)
	- The prevalence of the three forms of under-nutrition in this study was lower than the national figures. In addition, the levels of undernutrition are also lower than the WHO acceptable levels with an exception of wasting which is higher than the WHO acceptable levels of under-nutrition (Page 95)

# Infectious Morbidity 

## Identified Challenges
- Various studies have shown that illness among children in orphanages is higher (30%) especially diarrheal disease compared with 7 % in non-orphanage children. 
- The most prevalent illnesses were **acute respiratory infections (ARIs),malaria and diarrhoeal diseases**
- According to the American Academy of Pediatrics[^4], in reference to the foster care system
	- 30% to 80% of children come into foster care with at least 1 medical problem,and one-third have a chronic medical condition.
	- Early childhood trauma/toxic stress, especially if frequent or unremitting and not tempered by responsive, nurturing care giving, adversely affects the neurobiology of the developing brain.
	- Up to 80% of children and adolescents enter with a significant mental health need, and almost 40% have significant oral health issues.
	- Approximately 60% of children younger than 5 years have developmental health issues.
- According to Rainbow Homes, street children are at a higher risk for health concerns[^2]
	- Yuva studies show that children on the streets have higher incidence of trauma related injuries, development delays, sinusitis, anaemia and asthma, eczema, visual and neurological deficits as well as other disabilities.
	- Run away youth are its significant risk violence and victimisation substance abuse pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases
	- Studies on Street children in India show that the children experience high rates of physical emotional and mental health problems
	- Their intake of food is inadequate and the quality of food is poor.
	- In many cases they have sexually transmitted infections mental health status is unknown depression and society and low self esteem or very common
- In another study on the American foster care system[^7], 
	- Thirty percent to 60% of children in foster care have been estimated to have chronic health conditions. When behavioral, emotional, and developmental concerns are taken into consideration, the estimated proportion of foster children with serious health care needs jumps to ⬎80%.
	- Caregivers reported that 50.3% of the children had less than or equal to 1 SHCN at some point during the 3-year study period.
	- At baseline, 35.1% of children were reported to have had SHCNs. Thirty-one percent were reported to have had SHCNs at the 1.5-year follow-up, and 33.5% were reported to have had SHCNs at the 3.0-year follow-up.
	- Boys were significantly more likely than girls to have had SHCNs, and children aged 0 to 2 years at baseline were significantly less likely to have had SHCNs than older children.
	- Adopted and foster children were significantly more likely to have had SHCNs than children in other living arrangements.
	- Overall, 56.1% of children with either form of SHCN had 1 or less than 1 of the 7 developmental problems
	- Especially high rates of SHCNs in this target population seem to stem from the preponderance of developmental and behavioral needs. Children in the CWS show much higher rates of special needs than children in the general US population.
	- Our data suggest that the children with SHCNs in this sample were at substantially high risk for a variety of cognitive and behavioral impairments.
	- NSCAW includes 2 indicators of SHCNs: 
- the presence of a chronic health condition and the presence of special needs
- These children who have a special health care need are also at an increased risk for chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional conditions requiring extensive health and related services. The two main types of Special health care needs are:
	### Chronic health Conditions:

  - As for chronic health conditions, 27.9% of children had ever had one. children aged 0 to 2 years at baseline were significantly more likely to have had a chronic health condition than children aged 6 to 10 years at baseline.
  - Children with a chronic health condition were significantly more likely than children without SHCNs to have a score in the clinical range in the cognitive, adaptive, behavioral, social skill, and maths and reading areas.
  - Overall, 53.5% of children with chronic health conditions had a problem in less than or equal to 1 of these areas compared with 29.1% of children without special needs
	### Common Chronic health issues:
- The most commonly reported condition was asthma (8.0% and 8.5% at any given point). Overall, 12.8% of all of the children were reported to have had the condition over the course of 3 years.
    - A recent national study estimated that 13% of all children (younger than age 18 years) had at some point in their lives suffered from asthma
    - Other conditions less frequently reported over the course of 3 years included repeated ear infections (5.2%), other respiratory problems (4.7%), severe allergies (4.2%), epilepsy (1.9%), and eczema or other skin disease (2.0%).
	### Special Needs:
  - As reported by caregivers, 33.2% of children had a special need either currently or in the past. There were significant differences in having a special need by gender, age, poverty, and living arrangement.
  - Boys were significantly more likely than girls to have a special need, and children aged 0 to 2 years at baseline were significantly less likely to have a special need, compared with every other age group.
  - Children living at or below the poverty level at baseline were significantly more likely than children living above the poverty level at baseline to have had a special need.
  - Finally, adopted and foster children were more likely than children living at home to have had special needs
  - Children with a special need were significantly more likely than children without SHCNs to have any of the developmental problems. More than half (50.7%) of the children with special needs had a clinically significant score for behavioral problems.
  - Overall, 62.8% of children with special needs had less than or equal to 1 of these developmental problems compared with 29.1% of children without an SHCN..
	### Common Special Needs:
- The most common special need was a learning disability (10.4% and 13.7% at any given point). Overall, 20.6% of all of the children had learning disabilities over the course of 3 years.
    - Other commonly reported conditions over the 3-year study period included 14.1% of children with emotional disturbance, 12.3% with speech impairment, 2.4% with mental retardation, 2.0% with hearing impairment, 1.3% with autism, and 1.2% with vision impairment.
-   According to a meta analysis on institutionalisation[^9], they found significant physical development detriments in the lives of children in institutions, 
	- Dana Johnson and colleagues (Johnson et al., 1992) examined the medical condition of 65  previously institutionalized Romanian children who were adopted to the United States. 
	- They found that only 15% of these children were  considered physically healthy at the time of adoption. Convergent evidence for this finding comes from the Romanian children adopted to Canada (Fisher et al., 1997).
	-  In this sample, 85% of children had a reported medical problem
	- Similarly, Hostetter, Iverson, Thomas,  McKenzie, Dole, and Johnson (1991) found that at least one medical problem was reported for a majority of children adopted from 15 countries in East and South Asia, Central and South America, Africa, and the Caribbean and Pacific Islands. 
	- Fisher et al. (1997) found that according to their parents’ reports orphanage children’s most common medical problems when they were first adopted were
		-  intestinal parasites (31% of children),
		-  hepatitis B (28% of children) 
		-  anemia (15% of children). 
	- These medical problems are consistent  with those noted by other researchers who have examined medical problems in previously institutionalized children from Romania (Benoit, Jocelyn, Moddeman, & Embree, 1996; Gyorkos & MacLean, 1992; Jenista, 1992;  Marcovitch, Cesaroni, Roberts, & Swanson, 1995) and from several other countries (Hoksbergen, 1981; Hostetter et al. 1991). 
	-  Previously institutionalized children are typically small and malnourished after the orphanage experience. [Nutrition](Roll%20Ups/Nutrition/Nutrition.md)
		- Eighty-five percent of  orphanage children in the Canadian sample below the 10th percentile and 59% of children fell below the 5th percentile for weight (Morison et al., 1995). 
		- In another group of 16 Romanian children adopted to Canada, 50%  were below the 5th percentile for weight and  44% were below the 5th percentile for height (Benoit et al., 1996). Similarly, in the U.K
		-  In the UK sample of Romanian adoptees, Rutter and the ERA Study Team (1998) reported that half of  the children had heights, weights, and head  circumferences below the 3 percentile.
		-   In several studies growth retardation in height has been shown to be associated with the  length of time that children had spent in institutions (Ames, 1997; Johnson et al., 1992;  Rutter & the ERA Study Team, 1998). 
- According to another review paper covering papers on institutional care in CCIs[^8], Common illnesses observed were 
	- children having three or more parasites
	- skin infections
	- varicellazoster
	- tuberculosis
	- impetigo
	- dentalissues
	- ear/nose/throat problems
	- respiratory infections
	- diarrhoea
- 10-31% of children had skin conditions or infections
- 75% of children had an infection within the first three months of admission to a site(Kapavarapuetal.,2012)
- Anemia prevelance ranged from 3-90%
- 33% of children had low vitamin D
- Common deficiencies were iodine, zinc, albumin , vitamin A and B
- Edema, Conjunctival pallor, xerophthalmia and goiter were also found
Physical development in institutionalised vs. foster care children:

- Profound growth failure is a hallmark of institutional care in early childhood. The current study demonstrates that a small number of caregiving disruptions within foster care, which adults may view as trivial and even routine, can have significant additional effects on child wellbeing. The stress of having to accommodate changing care environments alters normal developmental processes and changes outcome for the worse.
- From an RCT that looked at 114 institutionalised children in the US, we can see that in comparison to foster group, the institutionalised group does worse off 
	- Profound growth failure is a hallmark of institutional care in early childhood. The current study demonstrates that a small number of caregiving disruptions within foster care, which adults may view as trivial and even routine, can have significant additional effects on child wellbeing. The stress of having to accommodate changing care environments alters normal developmental processes and changes outcome for the worse.
	- Compared with the institutionalized group, the foster care group showed greater rates of growth for height, weight, and BMI from baseline to age 12 years.
	- Increasing disruptions in the caregiving environment were related to decreasing rates of growth in height in foster care group and weight in institutionalized group and foster care group, but not BMI.
	- Aside from group differences in growth, the compromised height and weight growth patterns linked to individual differences in caregiver disruptions in foster care group underscore the importance of a consistent caregiving environment for child well-being.

### Common Infections:

- **Skin Infections:** Skin infections were reported most commonly followed by common cold and fever. A previous study done on orphans in the Southern state of Tamil Nadu similarly reported high prevalence of skin infections including pediculosis (25%) and oro-dental problems including dental caries (50%).
- **Eye Infections:** Infections of the eye were the lowest in prevalence. Similar prevalence of ear conditions was also reported. They however, also reported ophthalmic problems including Bitots spots which we did not find in our population.
- **Diarrheal disease and Respiratory Infections:** Some studies done on children residing in urban slums where prevalence of diarrheal disease and respiratory infections has been reported to be higher than our population

# Challenges to existing data 
According to a study conducted by the Duke Public Health Centre[^10], 
- Policy documents and legislation related to the care of children in institutions frequently cite studies of children who as infants lived in socially and emotionally deprived institutions in Romania and Russia.
  - These studies demonstrated powerful negative effects on the infant brain and child development .
  - When infants were removed from this environment to live with trained, paid, and supervised foster parents in Romania, brain and child development improvements were observed.
- In a meta-analysis of studies examining children in institutional and family care it was found that while intelligence quotient values trended toward being lower among infants in institutions, this relationship was not observed in lower income countries like Ethiopia , Kenya, and Eritrea, and was not observed among children over age five
- Recent assessments of children's nutritional status in Kenya  and of psychosocial status in China found children in group homes were doing somewhat better than their family-based comparisons
- The Positive Outcomes for Orphans (POFO) study is the only that enrolled a statistically representative sample of both institution-based and family-based orphaned and separated children (OSC) from culturally diverse sites across multiple LMICs
  - Cross-sectional analyses of baseline data found that health, emotional functioning, learning ability, memory, and physical growth were comparable, on average, for the 1,357 children living in 83 institutional care settings and the 1,480 children living with families in 311 community clusters (geographically bounded sampling areas) in the same regions.
# Rights Bases Approach to Health 
[^1]
According to the Kenyan Government, health needs to take a rights based approach
- Every child shall have equal rights, opportunities and responsibilities as any other child and shall be protected from all forms of discrimination.
- Every child shall have access to relevant health information, knowledge and skills that are appropriate for their age, gender, culture, language and context.
- Every child has a right to quality education. Access to education will continue to be facilitated for vulnerable groups (girls, orphans, children with disabilities and special needs).
- Children are the most vulnerable members of our society by virtue of their age and stage of growth. Therefore, their rights should be safeguarded and protected.
- The four key pillars of child rights as articulated in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and as enshrined in the Kenya Children Act 2001. These include:
  
#### Survival rights:
- These include:
	- Adequate measures shall be put in place to provide both preventive and curative medical care for all children.
	- Feeding programmes shall be established and food supplements given to the vulnerable children especially those living in poverty and marginalized areas.
  
#### Developmental rights:

- To ensure that these rights are practised or respected we shall ensure that:
	- The IEC programme shall be developed and used to inculcate the importance of play and leisure for the continued holistic growth and development of th echild.
  
#### Protection rights:
- The following shall be assured:
	- Stringent enforcement of the existing protection measures against drug abuse by reinforcing the relevant section of the Children Act 2001
	- Provision of awareness campaigns on dangers of drug and substance abuse
	- Accessible and affordable rehabilitation and rescue centres for children in conflict with the law including those who abuse drugs
	- Provision of specialized staff in children institutions to detect and deal with drugs and substance abuse
	- Affordable specialized medical care for children addicted to drugs and other substance
	- Awareness campaign and information on the dangers of sexual exploitation
	- Provision of free medical treatment for all sexually abused children
	- Measures to discourage negative cultural beliefs and practices that support child marriages, child labour and Female Genital Mutilation
	- Life skills shall be part of the school curriculum
	- Peer education programme will be critical to improve effective communication.
	- Schools and the community shall plan and implement education programmes that promote positive socio-cultural behaviour among children
	- The school shall have adequate provisions for guidance and counselling services.
  
#### Participation Rights :

- Children are entitled to the freedom to express opinions and to have a say in matters affecting their social, economic, religious, cultural and political life.
    - Participation rights include the right to express opinions and be heard, the right to information and freedom of association.
    - Respecting these rights as they mature helps children bring about the realization of all their rights and prepares them for an active role in society.
    - As such school children shall be allowed to actively participate in all appropriate fora to express their opinions in matters affecting their health and education

## Declaration on child rights by the UN [^2]
Articles in the UN convention on the rights of the child relevant to the health of a child
- Article 2: a mentally or physically disabled child should enjoy a full and decent life in conditions which ensure your dignity promote self reliance and facility to child active participation in the community
- Article 24 the right of any child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health
- Article 25 the right of a child placed by competent authorities for the purposes of care protection of treatment of his or her physical or mental health to a periodic review of the treatment provided to the child
- Article 39 all appropriate measures to be taken to promote the physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of a child victim of any form of abuse and neglect

## Indian Rights Guaranteed
- The constitution of India article 15 guarantee special attention to children through necessary and special laws in policies that safeguard their rights
  - The directive principles of State policy in India says the state shall endeavor to achieve social and economic welfare of the people by guarding the children against exploitation and moral degradation
- National commission for protection of child rights march set up in 2007 ensure the policies programs and administrative mechanisms are in consonance with the child rights perspectives
- The ICPS 2009 centrally sponsored scheme of women and child development to provide a safe and secure environment for children so that they do not become vulnerable to exploitation, neglect and abuse.
- The spirit of all declaration goes beyond physical health of a child and talks about his overall being. The concept of well being is very important in a program for child health.
- Children and young people need to develop healthy lifestyles and opportunities to achieve optimum health and well-being. This is a collective responsibility.

# Models of Health Care- An International and Domestic Comparison

## Global Comparison of Health Standards in Residential Care 

Rainbow[^2] Homes has documented different national standards for children in institutional care across multiple countries 
### India
- No documented protocols on health standards for children in India. 
- In India we have to have to build standards with specific understanding of children were homeless when developing health protocols for them. Set of underpinning principles on which services should be based as well as outline some key standards that need to be implemented

### Australia
  - Standard 4- each child and young person has an individualized plan that details the health education and other needs
  - Standard 5 -children and young people have their physical development psychosocial and mental health needs assessed and attended to in a timely way.
  - Health record relevant health information that is in a consolidated form that documents the child or young person state of health and identified needs.
  - Luminary help check to establish the ongoing relationship between child care and the primary health provider. 
  - Physical health development till and psychosocial and mental health domains is to be assessed. To ensure care and enable support of both the child in carer overtime.

### UK
- Should have a holistic health assessment on entering care
  - Assessment should be done by a suitably qualified medical practitioner
  - First assessment should result in a health plan and if a child has been already assist the new assessment should be to update based on the child change circumstance
  - Attention should be given to the continuity of previous plans and interventions
  - All health staff with information about child health should ensure that this is made available to the person undertaking the assessment as soon as possible
  - Health assessment needs to be a continuous process not an isolated event. It needs to have a flexible approach appropriate to the child and stage of development
  - Health plan should clearly set out objectives actions timescales responsibilities are arising from the health assessment
  - Health plan needs to be reviewed in line with statutory requirement timescale
  - health assessments must be taken twice a year annually for children and young people under five years
  - Balance the sensitive and confidential nature of the child and young persons health information

## Models of Care in Indian institutions

Rainbow[^2] Homes has documented different institutional standards for other domestic service providers to CNCP in India

### Health models in Sneh Ghars Delhi
- Coordinated by centre for equity studies there on homes for children in Delhi Hyderabad and Bengaluru.
- Homes in Delhi are in partnership with the Delhi government. It provides infrastructure NGO managers and funds the program.
- Approach is holistic balance maintained between preventive promotive and curative services
- #### Objectives
  - Ensure preventive promotive and curative physical and mental care of all children in residential care including immunization hygiene health education de addiction nutrition tracking individual and group counseling
  - Establish linkages with public and private health Care institutions and functionaries at the primary secondary and tertiary levels
  - Provide emergency curative health care support event to children on streets
  - Homes document and maintain record for each child
- #### Challenges
  - Homes given by Government are in bad condition
  - Severe constraint of space leading to health problems from overcrowding
  - They do not refuse any child Khushi entry into home does living conditions are unhygienic

### Health models in Rainbow Homes for street children Kolkata

- Run by Loreto convent Kolkata
- Use rainbow homes on their top floors
- Model where rainbow children are integrated into mainstream school and loreto convent School children participate in rainbow home programs
- A nurse is present throughout.
- Hygiene and quality of food is good
- Regular I eye and dental check up, no routine documentation
- Every child case history e and medical services availed are file in referral slips, doctor slips and prescriptions
- Contact is maintained with family and once a month there is a mandatory meeting between children and parents

# Health Approaches in Institutional settings
As documented by Rainbow homes [^2], there are different approaches to healthcare

### Medical approach
- heavily dependent on qualified medical practitioners services provide on a case by case basis.
- It is wasteful and over medical eyes is health issues

### Health worker approach 
- focus more on preventive and promotive aspects of health. 
- Primary needs are addressed at the level of a health worker.

### Balanced approach
- In this view all staff members are fundamentally health workers and need training
- Program should have thoroughly trained supervised supported health workers
- For health programmes, the home needs to set up a health management advisory committee including a doctor public health specialist on a voluntary basis. 
- The set up also includes Ayush Specialists to teach home health remedies
- While sitting up a help program math existing resources including friendly doctors government dispensaries health centers hospitals, information on existing government schemes like free beds.
- Maintain supportive network for reference financial aid and volunteer action

# Preventative Approaches
## Preventive and promoters health programs include

### Food and nutrition
- Meal planning- helps provide adequate nutritional requirements
- Diet should contain cereals pulses fruits vegetables milk products fat and oil
- children should have high protein.
- Provide sufficient iron rich food like meat, green leafy vegetables and eggs.
- Minimize laws of nutrients by using sprouted grams and fermented food.
- Use a pressure cooker to conserve nutrients.
- Vegetables like potatoes should be boiled with skin and use iron utensils to cook food wash vegetables before cutting should avoid artificial preservatives.
- Drink a lot of water.
- Meal chart with structure and venue for all mails should be available for all.
- Quality of food needs to be monitor on a regular basis

### Food handlers

- food handlers should wear caps should be vaccinated against typhoid and hepatitis
- should have hand washing facilities available for them
- trim nails use long handle ladles for food and water

### Infrastructure and hygiene in the homes

- Proper ventilation and lighting
- Clean water supply from Government water board water tested every month and treated
- Regular cleaning of bathrooms
- Proper mechanism for waste disposal
- Fumigation in the home.
- Space to play
- Encourage having pets

### **Growth monitoring** to identify the children who need urgent intervention

- This includes measuring weight and height calculation of body mass index- for BMI not down age of the child weight of the child in kg height of the child in cm. BMI is a number that indicates the person's weight in proportion to height
- Height for age growth indicator that relieves height to a child's age
- Wait for each growth indicator that reliefs weight to a child age
- Plot measurements on growth charts
- Know how to interpret scores based on average
- Take actions in situation of growth faltering or or with diseases like TB
- In cases of severe malnutrition provide special food for few months

## Health education and health camps

- To help children become aware of health in different ways to develop positive attitude towards health is individuals
- To help become aware of appropriate health needs at a particular ages.
- To encourage to learn decides skills and form decide habits about food exercise sleep rest and relaxation
- To help children know and accept individual and collective responsibility for healthy living
- To help children in still life skills and character building stress management sensory motor skills
- To help being acquainted with nutritional requirements environmental hygiene sanitation and common diseases their prevention and control
- To help children know the status of health identify health problems and be informed for taking appropriate remedial measures
- To create awareness about rules of safety in hazardous situations to avoid accidents to be acquainted with first aid measures about common sickness
- To teach correct postural habits
- Help understand process of growing up during adolescence as well as about HIV drug abuse and issues around
- Address physical psychosocial needs of differently abled children

### Regarding the sessions

- Health workers should be trained to handle the sessions
- Issues related to sexual health are sensitive
- Local NGO specializing on these issues could be invited as resource persons
- Ensure maximum involvement of children and in the sessions make it interactive
- Encourage health education sessions for parents who visit children

### Health camp

- Eye and dental check up could be organized that regular intervals
- Government or local NGOs to be involved in delivering the services have the dates set in advance for the camp
- Appropriate physical arrangement should be made
- Ensure follow up of children who have been referred for further treatment

## Emphasis on Caregiving
- Hand washing is effective in minimizing incidence of diseases such as cholera and diarrhoea among children. It also reduces deaths from diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections by almost half and one quarter respectively (Page 28)
- The same study showed that among children in orphanages, 64% were stunted compared with 46% of the non- (Page 29)
- 16 orphanage children. In addition, girls in orphanages were more likely to be malnourished than boys. (Page 30)
- Research has demonstrated that positive interaction between a child and a caregiver significantly impacts the development of the brain (Page 31)
- Involvement of the community by supporting the running of the orphanages through both participatory and material support was viewed as long term solution to these problems. Participatory support would help in maintaining good discipline, moral values and life skills of the children and material support would ensure that their basic needs (health status and nutrition well-being) are met. (Page 55)
- The number of children served by each caregiver is critical to higher quality care.Poor caregiver to child ratio not only inhibits social interaction, but also influences the way caregiver responds to the needs of the children. Although young children in group care often fail to thrive, tend to be sickly and often demanding of attention; provision of supportive and stable caregiver to child relationships is of paramount importance (Page 75)
- Skipping breakfast during childhood has been associated with malnutrition and may also have an adverse effect on cognitive function, academic performance, psychosocial function and mood in children and young people (Page 81)
- Deworming has health benefits in children as worms impact negatively on the mental and physical development of children. Ample evidence have shown that deworming has a significant impact on health, education and livelihoods of treated children (Page 87)
- Outcomes of deworming include decreased anaemia and improves nutrition, increases growth and weight gain, improves cognition and mental and physical development, increases resistance to other infections, supports more frequent school attendance, improves children’s ability to learn better and be more active in (Page 87)
- The orphanage’s management in conjunction with the Ministry of Health should carry out monthly growth monitoring to detect early onset of malnutrition among children 6-59 months of age for timely intervention to reduce on cases of malnutrition. (Page 96)
- The orphanages’ management should intensify the supervision of children during meal times to ensure adequate dietary intake and inclusive consumption of food. A watchful eye and gentle warning can save children from malnutrition caused by poor dietary intake. (Page 96)

## Screening & Regular Checks
 #### Under 5 : Focus should be on
  - Physical health growth, diet, immunization, teeth,
  - Experience of caring relationships and emotional well being
  - Monitoring development and milestones with respect to speech, language, motor skills. mission and hearing play pre literacy skills social and self help skills

- #### Middle years 5 to 10 years:Focus should be on
  - physical health and management of specific health conditions, growth monitoring, communication skills, selfcare ability to make relationships and to relate to peers,
  - mental and emotional health including depression, exercise, balance diet,
  - progress at School, awareness of basic safety issues,
  - cope with physical and emotional changes associated with puberty,
  - access to accurate and simple information about sexual activity immunization dental health experience of caring relationships

- ### Adolescence and leaving care 11 to 18 years
  - Ability to take responsibility for own health including management of specific health conditions communication and interpersonal skills education and social progress lifestyle including diet and physical activity
  - ensuring immunization are up-to-date mental and emotional health including depression understanding of issues relating to sexual and sexual activity
  - access to information and advice about health issues including this of alcohol and substance use to
  - have a full copy of the social care health records

### Health Planning, Implementation and Review

- Report should be brought out for every child after assessment to draw out health plan
- If there is a history of abuse if child is malnourished then it calls for immediate interventions
- Health worker should be aware of health plan of every child and must have a checklist of interventions and actions that need to be taken
- Protocols are mandatory for a child who enters the home

  - remove the poison from the skin if the poison is a dry powder it could be brush stuff about
- Cover the skin area with a large amount of water

# Possible reasons for the high incidence of morbidity:

- **Poor living conditions and utilisation of facilities:** The high prevalence of common morbidities reported in the present study as well as the inadequate treatment seeking practices of orphanage heads reflects the poor living conditions and inadequate knowledge of common diseases and their treatment. It also shows the poor utilisation of healthcare facilities, although all had access to a doctor.
	- According to Rainbow Homes, They do not have access to comprehensive health services immunization routine child health surveillance and health promotion.
- **Lack of Awareness** : Many diseases were found to be present due to lack of awareness about disease causation. Further, none of the children knew about the complications of most diseases under study, even when they were suffering from it.
  - Knowledge of signs and symptoms of common childhood morbidities was low among resident children, especially for fevers, skin infections/ infestations and ear conditions.
  - None of the children knew the common conditions presenting with fever (including malaria, dengue, typhoid and others).
  - None of the children had heard about scabies earlier, and none considered otitis media to be a dangerous condition. Only two children who had previous pneumonia knew about common symptoms of the disease, but not complications.
  - None of the children were aware that worm infestation could occur through faeco-oral route
- **Poor nutrition:** Poor nutritional status has been shown to be widely prevalent and directly associated with morbidities among institutionalised children. Further, the poor nutritional status of the children may have an impact on their cognition levels which may worsen their awareness and treatment seeking practices. Vaida et al reported the contrary by showing the majority of orphan children having normal nutritional status, with no clear relationship between orphan-hood and the nutritional status of children compared with those who lived with their parents.
- **Low immunity at younger age:** We also found the morbidities to be higher among younger age groups which may be explained by their lower immunity levels and young age as a risk factor for most diseases.
- **Poor utilisation of healthcare facilities**, According to a South Indian study on morbidity status of a 100 orphanaged children[^6],
	  - Hospital care was sought for very few cases. This is of concern since most of the morbidities in children are accompanied by frequent complications, thereby increasing the morbidity burden further.
	  - Treatment seeking practices were found to be unsatisfactory with predominance of self treatment or using drugs without prescription either from local RMPs or upon pharmacists' advice.
	  - Orphanage staff may not be trained to identify development of danger signs which may pose grave risks to the children.
- L**ack of proper certified and approved measurement tools.** The uncertainty abounding in the efficiency of these organisations, especially in third world countries, have led researchers to devise proxy indicators for estimating efficiency and quality through assessment of health status, among other indicators, of the residents. Valid measures, required for planning promotional measures for the welfare of orphaned children, requires reliable data on their health and nutrition status. Such data was grossly deficient from different parts of the country, more so from South India.

## Introduction to common childhood illnesses

# Organisations and individuals involved in supporting looked-after children: [^11]
## Clinical Commissioning groups (CCGs):

  - CCGs are the main commissioners of health services. CCGs should ensure:
    - they can access the expertise of a designated doctor and nurse for looked-after children. Where a designated professional is employed by a different NHS organisation, this will need to be set out in a local agreement.
    - When looked-after children move placement or move into another CCG area and are currently receiving, or on a waiting list for, health services, their treatment continues uninterrupted. Looked-after children should be seen without delay or wait no longer than a child in a local area with an equivalent need who requires an equivalent service. The length of a placement should not affect a child's access to services.
    - Arrangements are in place to ensure a smooth transition for looked-after children and care leavers moving from child to adult health services.
  - When a child is first placed, the local authority looking after them has a shared responsibility with the relevant CCG to ensure that a full health assessment takes place and that a health plan is drawn up and implemented.
  - Some placements need to be arranged urgently and prior notification will not always be possible. In these cases, in accordance with Regulation 13(3)(f) of the Care Planning, Placement and Case Review (England) Regulations 2010, the local authority is expected to notify the relevant responsible CCG within five working days or as soon as reasonably practicable
  - Out of authority placements of looked-after children are dealt with in a different way. Where a CCG or a local authority, or both where they are acting together, arrange accommodation for a looked-after child in the area of another CCG, the originating CCG remains the responsible CCG for the services that CCGs have responsibility for commissioning. That is the case even where the child changes his or her GP practice
  - Factors that should determine any decision about which CCG's commissioned service undertakes the health assessment are:
    - the distance at which the child is placed. If a child is placed far from home, the responsible CCG should consider if it is more practicable, and will lead to the child receiving a better healthcare experience, to commission health professionals in the area of the receiving CCG
    - the need to ensure they are satisfied with the quality of health assessment and follow-up to the actions that are identified
    - knowledge about the availability of local services that can meet the child's needs.

## National Health Service (NHS):

  - The NHS has a major role in ensuring the timely and effective delivery of health services to looked-after children. In fulfilling those responsibilities the NHS contributes to meeting the health needs of looked-after children in three ways: commissioning effective services, delivering through provider organisations, and through individual practitioners providing coordinated care for each child.
  - Under the Children Act 1989, CCGs and NHS England have a duty to comply with requests from a local authority to help them provide support and services to looked-after children.
  - NHS England should ensure:
    - looked-after children are always registered with GPs and have access to dentists near to where they are living. This is a shared responsibility with the local authority for the children it looks after.
    - When looked-after children need to register with a new GP (e.g. when they enter care or change placement), the transfer of GP-held clinical records is fast tracked
  - NHS England guidance: Who Pays? Determining responsibility for payments to providers; provides the framework for establishing responsibility for commissioning an individual's care within the NHS.
  - The Department of Health, with NHS England, Monitor, the Royal Colleges and other partners, has developed a mandatory national currency and tariff for statutory health assessments for looked-after children placed out of the area. Details are set out in the current National Tariff Payment System.

## Designated doctor and nurse:

  - Designated doctors and nurses have a very important role in promoting the health and welfare of looked-after children. The role is:
    - to assist CCGs and other commissioners of health services in fulfilling their responsibilities to improve the health of looked-after children
    - intended to be strategic, separate from any responsibilities for individual lookedafter children (although the professionals in these posts may also provide a direct service to children outside their designated role).
-
## Social workers:

  - **Care planning framework** : As an integral part of care planning, social workers must make arrangements to ensure that every looked-after child has:
    - their physical, emotional and mental health needs assessed
    - a health plan describing how those identified needs will be addressed to improve health outcomes
    - their health plan reviewed in line with care planning requirements, or at other times if the child's health needs change. This must be done in accordance with The Care Planning, Placement and Case Review (England) Regulations 2010.
  - Social workers have an important role in promoting the health and welfare of looked-after children. In particular they should:
    - work in partnership with carers, looked-after children, their birth parents where appropriate and health professionals to contribute to the formulation of the health plan
    - ensure that all the necessary consents and delegated authority permissions have been obtained so that decisions are not delayed
    - take action to liaise with relevant health professionals if actions identified in the health plan are not being followed up. Given the impact that poor physical, emotional and mental health can have on learning, they should also ensure the child's virtual school head is involved in resolving any health care needs that impact on the child's education
    - ensure the child has a copy of the care plan and the health plan
    - support foster carers, or the appropriate person in the children's home where a child is placed, to promote the child's physical and emotional health on a day-to-day basis. That should include providing them with information on the child's state of health, including a copy of the child's latest health plan
    - ensure that there is clarity for carers, GPs and dentists, and for the child, about what health care decisions have been delegated to carers.
  - Social workers should also ensure:
    - that foster carers and residential care staff know it is their responsibility to make sure a child attends their health assessment and all other medical, dental and optical appointments, and facilitate any required treatment regimes.
    - that the children their authority looks after, including teenage parents, have access to available positive activities such as arts, sport and culture, in order to promote their sense of well-being.

## Local authority:

  - As corporate parents, those involved in providing local authority services for the children they look after should have the same high aspirations and ensure the children receive the care and support they need in order to thrive.
  - Local authorities have a duty under the Children Act 1989 to safeguard and promote the welfare of the children they look after, wherever they are placed. This must be done in accordance with the relevant Regulations. These Regulations set out the requirements governing the development and review of a looked after child's care plan. That plan includes their health plan, the development of which should be based on the written report of the health assessment. The health plan forms part of the child's overall care plan.
  - The local authority that looks after the child must arrange for them to have a health assessment as required by The Care Planning, Placement and Case Review (England) Regulations 2010. The initial health assessment must be done by a registered medical practitioner. Review health assessments may be carried out by a registered nurse or registered midwife.
  - Understanding the emotional and behavioural needs of looked-after children is important. Local authorities are required to use the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to assess the emotional well-being of individual looked-after children
  - **Notification of placement:** When a child starts to be looked after or changes placement, the local authority must, before the placement is made, notify:
    - the child's GP,
    - parents (except where clearly inappropriate),
    - those caring for the child,
    - the CCG for the area in which the child is living,
    - the CCG and the local authority for the area in which the child is to be/ has been placed.
  - The local authority that looks after the child must make arrangements for a registered medical practitioner or a registered nurse or registered midwife to review a looked-after child's health needs and provide a written report for each review addressing the matters specified in section 1 of Schedule 1 of the Care Planning, Placement and Case Review (England) Regulations 2010 (see pages 16-17 of this guidance).
-
## Independent Reviewing Officers (IROs):

  - The IRO should, as part of the child's case review, note any actions and updates to ensure that the health plan continues to meet the child's needs.
  - The IRO should be proactive in bringing any deficiencies in the quality of the health plan or its delivery to the attention of the appropriate level of management within the local authority, using the local dispute resolution process if necessary
  - IROs should always ensure that looked-after children are involved in the review of their care plan and its component parts, and have their wishes and feelings heard and respected.
-
## Primary care teams (General Practitioners, health professionals, named professionals):

  - Staff working with looked-after children who are delivering health services should make sure their systems and processes track and focus on meeting each child's physical, emotional and mental health needs without making them feel different. They should in particular:
    - ensure looked-after children are able to access universal services as well as targeted and specialist services where necessary
    - receive supervision, training, guidance and support
  - The lead health record for a looked-after child should be the GP-held record. The initial health assessment and health plan, and subsequent review assessments and plans, should be part of that record.
  - Primary care teams have a vital role in identifying the individual health care needs of looked-after children. They often have prior knowledge of the child, of the birth parents and of carers, helping them to take a child-centred approach to health care decisions. They may also have continuing responsibility for the child when he or she returns home
  - GP practices should:
    - ensure timely access to a GP or other appropriate health professional when a looked-after child requires a consultation
    - provide summaries of the health history of a child who is looked after, including information on immunisations and covering their family history where relevant and appropriate, and ensure that this information is passed promptly to health professionals undertaking health assessments
    - maintain a record of the health assessment and contribute to any necessary action within the health plan
    - make sure the GP-held clinical record for a looked-after child is maintained and updated and that health records are transferred quickly if the child registers with a new GP practice, such as when he or she moves into another CCG area, leaves care or is adopted.
  - All healthcare staff who come into contact with looked-after children should work within the Royal Colleges intercollegiate framework. This framework identifies the competences that enable healthcare staff to promote the health and well-being of looked after children. They are a combination of the skills, knowledge, values and attitudes that are required for safe and effective practice
  - Named nurses and doctors for looked-after children have an important role in promoting good professional practice within their organisation and providing advice and expertise for fellow professionals
  - Working with the designated professionals for looked-after children, named health professionals should:
    - coordinate the provision of local health services for individual looked-after children and the input into health assessments and their reviews for individual looked-after children
    - ensure the timeliness and quality of health assessments for looked-after children and ensure actions taken to implement the health care plan are tracked
    - act as a key conduit and contact point for the child and their carer, where they have difficulties accessing health services.

## Virtual school heads (VSHs) and designated teachers:

  - Maintained schools and academies are required to have a designated teacher for looked after children. Given the interrelationship between health and education outcomes, social workers should ensure that the authority's VSH and the designated teacher for looked-after children are aware of information about the child's physical, emotional or mental health that may have an impact on his or her learning and educational progress

# Maintaining Health Records
###  Significance
  - Essential in providing in quality care
  - Charts medical history
  - Can help care workers identify preventive health needs
  - Helpful with immunisation dental Care and special care plan for children
  - Helpful with growth monitoring
- 
- #### Records - every child should have the following records
- Help assessment form
- Health plan
- health checklist

- #### Registers
  - Sick child register- names of its children doctors remarks medicines diagnostics
  - health camp register - day and date of the camp names of the children who need treatment
  - growth monitoring register -write age height in weight of the child then calculate growth indicators
  - hospital register -for children who are referred and need long term treatment
  - immunisation and deworming register- month wise register with children who need immunisation or deworming
  -  Minutes of meeting register: Record the minutes of meeting held on health education or health related training
  - Drugs stock register- have name of a drug expiry date and how many left at the end of the month
  -
- #### Monthly report
  - to get an overview of the health condition of the home and children
  - make sure to note number of children in referral and follow ups
  - number of children immunised number of malnourished children what interventions have been taken what have been the improvement
  - consolidated data provides details on what measures are being taken

- ### Assessment Tools 
- [^10]According to the POFO study, for physical health, - Physical Health and Growth- Caregiver-reported child health measures included symptoms of fever, cough, and diarrhea in the last 2 weeks and the general health of the child. The latter was rated on a scale of 1 to 5 from the Medical Outcomes.
-  For the Kenyan study on morbidity status of children in institutions, 
	- - A structured researcher-administered questionnaire for caregivers was the main data-collection tool. It was used to collect socio-demographic data, dietary intake, healthcare practices and anthropometric data. An observation checklist and Key InformantInterview (KII) guide were used to gather information on experiences and challenges on dietary practices, health care, water, hygiene, sanitation and other concerns relevant to the study about children in orphanages. (Page 39)
	- Data on dietary practices was collected using a 7 day food frequency questionnaire and a 24-hour food recall. Anthropometric data was collected using SECA scale and paediatric height board. (Page 39)
	- Water and Hygiene practices were assessed by collecting information on whether there was availability and accessibility of water for drinking and washing hands, frequency of brushing teeth and bathing, availability of latrines/ toilets or bathrooms and human waste disposal. Caregivers who reported bathing the children daily were rated as having good bathing hygiene while those who bathed children four to six times a week and less than four times a week were rated as having adequate and poor bathing hygiene respectively (UNICEF, 2009c). (Page 42)
	- Furthermore, when less than 40 children share one latrine is usually considered fair, forty to one hundred children using one latrine is classified bad and 100 children sharing a single latrine is dangerous (Page 28)
	- Respondents were to try to remember everything they fed the child and were provided with household measures used in the institution while feeding children. These household measures included; cups, plates, jugs, metallic containers and spoons.Caregivers were asked to measure total amounts of food served and total amounts eaten. These amounts were measured and converted into weights measurements. All the ingredients in the meals and their weights were recorded. Food models and pictures were used to help respondent judge and report portion size. (Page 44)
-  For the study in Southern India on morbidity profiles, 
	- - The questionnaire was developed to yield demographic and morbidity-related information about the participants.
	- Details related to the number of days a child was suffering from the present condition, number of episodes of illnesses in the past one year, number of times adequate treatment was offered, and place of treatment were collected.
	- Anthropometric examination was conducted for each participant and recorded.
	  - **Weight:** Weight was recorded to the nearest multiple of 10 grams using an electronic weighing balance, Tanita HD −318 digital weighing scales (Tanita Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Each participant was weighed with minimum clothing and without shoes, standing upright with arms hanging by the sides.
	  - **Height** : Height was recorded to the nearest centimetre (cm) using a non-flexible fibreglass tape, Seca 206 mechanical measuring tape (Seca, GmBH and Co Kg, Hamburg, Germany). The respondent was asked to stand upright on a firm level ground, against a flat vertical surface without shoes.
	  - **BMI calculation:** The body mass indices of the participants were calculated in kg/m2 based on the measured weight and height and were plotted on separate BMI charts for boys and girls
	  - **Clinical assessment:** The condition of skin, eyes, hair, gums, nails and thyroid gland was observed for clinical assessment of nutritional deficiencies. Systemic examination for reported morbidities was conducted according to the hospital protocols of Mediciti Hospital.

- According to a paper on Special Needs[^7], Indicators for Chronic health conditions and Special Needs 

	- NSCAW includes 2 indicators of SHCNs: the presence of a chronic health condition and the presence of special needs. Each of these indicators is based on a caregiver report.

	- #### Chronic Health Conditions: 
		- At each interview, caregivers were asked whether their child had any health problems that last a long time or come back again and again. If yes, caregivers were asked to name them. Caregivers could report ⬎1 problem. For the chronic health condition questions, the wording denoted a chronic health condition prevalent at the time of the interview
  -
	- #### Special Needs: 
		- At each interview, caregivers were asked if they had ever been told by an educational or health professional, or told since the last interview, that their child has &quot;learning problems, special needs or developmental disabilities. 
		- If yes to either of these questions, caregivers were asked to describe these problems. The special needs questions in NSCAW were designed to correspond with disability categories under the Individuals With Disabilities Act.


	- #### Assessing Maltreatment characteristics:

	  - The most serious type of maltreatment was assessed by asking the caseworkers the following question in the baseline interview: Of the types of abuse or neglect that were reported, please tell me the type that you felt was the most serious (physical maltreatment, sexual maltreatment, emotional maltreatment, physical neglect (failure to provide), neglect (lack of supervision), abandonment, moral/legal maltreatment, educational maltreatment, exploitation, and other)
	  - For the majority of children, the main type of maltreatment was neglect (lack of supervision: 25.2%; failure to provide: 18.0%), followed by physical abuse (25.2%).

# Challenges & Ethical concerns

- [^11]According to guidance from the Dept of Health, NHS, Accurate information about health history, and any current/ongoing medical conditions, may be vital to securing the right placement for a looked-after child.
- For this reason, obtaining consent to information sharing is a vital first principle to promoting the health of looked-after children. The person or third party will need to understand the reasons why particular information needs to be shared, so that they can give informed consent
- Where disclosure of a child's information might reveal information about other individuals (e.g. parents, family), consent should be sought from these individuals as well.
- Where it is not practicable to seek consent or where the individual is not competent to give consent, it is important to consider whether disclosure would be justified in the public interest(e.g. to protect others from a risk so serious that it outweighs the individual's right to privacy).
- Decisions to disclose information in the public interest must be taken on a case by case basis, and should always be fully documented
- According to Rainbow Homes, 
	- Balance between autonomy and paternalism
	- Make sure children participate in their own health issues inform them of the inventions that are in place
	- In case of HIV screening obtain informed consent from children and their parents
	- Confidentiality
	  - Keep private information secure disclosing this information to people deliberately or accidentally is an infringement of confidentiality which may harm the child
	  - Information on HIV or genetically inherited conditions may bring social stigma and ostracism
	- Doing no harm and injustice
	  - Intentionally do not create harmorr injury to the child
	  - Health worker should provide proper standard of care that avoids the risk of harm
	  - Make sure the culture is respectful caring sensitive and responsive in a context where a health management is paternalistic process ensure genuine respect for the privacy of the child**
