# Current realities in institutional settings
In a literature review conducted for a study on morbidity in preschool children in institutions in Kenya, we find out that [^3]
- Prevailing conditions in orphanages may predispose children to increased prevalence of malnutrition and infectious diseases like diarrhoea and respiratory tract infections. Unavailability of safe and nutritious foods in orphanage set up and access to safewater are likely to lead to increase levels of malnutrition among children. (Page 22) 
- However, studies have established that most caregivers lack nutrition awareness and that once a child reaches preschool age, caregivers divert their attention from the children to other matters and care giving becomes a secondary issue. Thus, the nutrition needs are neglected (Mile,Milena and Biljana, 2013). (Page 26)
- Child malnutrition is associated with susceptibility to infection and as a result many children are more likely to be prone to common childhood ailments such as diarrhoea and respiratory infections; and for those who survive, frequent illness affects their nutrition status due to lowered resistance to infections (Page 27)
- Various studies have shown that illness among children in orphanages is higher (30%) especially diarrheal disease compared with 7 % in non-orphanage children. It has also been shown that more boys are usually stunted with high morbidity rates than girls (Page 28)
- In a study carried out in Botswana (Misra & Bignami, 2008) it was found that children in orphanages were 49% more likely to be underweight than non-orphanage children. The findings concurred with those of Lindblade et al. (2003) in Malawi where it was demonstrated that the prevalence of malnutrition in children in orphanages (below 6 years old) was 55% compared with 30% of non-orphanage children. (Page 29)
- In the present study, majority (79.0%) of the preschool children consumed adequate amounts of recommended energy per day. (Page 56)
- For protein intake, nearly all (90.1%) children consumed adequate amounts of recommended proteins per day (Page 57)
- Prevalence of undernutrition seemed to increase significantly with an increase in length of stay in the orphanage (Page 69)
- Children whose caregivers had not received any form of training on childcare practices were more likely to be underweight, wasted and stunted respectively. (Page 72)
- Consumption of meat, fruits and vegetables was low. Low consumption of fruits and vegetables could expose children to the risk of micronutrient deficiencies that take long to manifest. All children were served same quantities of food. The difference in energy intake was a result of poor appetite, illness among children as well as age. (Page 93)
- The most prevalent illnesses were acute respiratory infections (ARIs),malaria and diarrhoeal diseases. (Page 93)
- Nutrition status (underweight) showed a positive significant relationship with institutional characteristics and dietary practices. (Page 94)
- The results imply that the longer a child stays in the orphanage, the more likely the child would be stunted and underweight. Children who consumed adequate energy intake were less likely to be underweight and stunted respectively (Page 94)
- From the study, it can be concluded that good nutrition status can be equated with appropriate childcare practices and low morbidity burden. Majority of children living in orphanages in Kwale County had good nutrition status as depicted by the low levels of undernutrition. This was likely due to consumption of at least three meals per day, diversity of foods consumed, appropriate knowledge in caregiving among thecaregivers in the orphanages, favourable caregiver to child ratios, good health care practices, adequate consumption of energy and other nutrients. This was also enhanced by the effect of the low morbidity burden noted among the children. (Page 95)
- The prevalence of the three forms of under-nutrition in this study was lower than the national figures. In addition, the levels of undernutrition are also lower than the WHO acceptable levels with an exception of wasting which is higher than the WHO acceptable levels of under-nutrition (Page 95)
- According to the American Academy of Pediatrics[^4], in reference to the foster care system
	- 30% to 80% of children come into foster care with at least 1 medical problem,and one-third have a chronic medical condition.
	- Early childhood trauma/toxic stress, especially if frequent or unremitting and not tempered by responsive, nurturing care giving, adversely affects the neurobiology of the developing brain.
	- Up to 80% of children and adolescents enter with a significant mental health need, and almost 40% have significant oral health issues.
	- Approximately 60% of children younger than 5 years have developmental health issues.
- [^5]According to a large-scale literature review on institutional care conducted by the University of Delaware, relative to their peers, they show atypically short height, low weight, and small head circumference (Page 6)
- According to a study on moribidity profile of 100 orphaned children in Southern India[^6]
	- Deprivation of parental care and, often, food, education, and medical care experienced by children. Studies often report that lack of parental care and denial of a secure family life, coupled with congested and often unhygienic living conditions, affect orphan children adversely.
	- Research identifies the risks of orphanage care that may broadly be classified as:
	  - Infectious morbidity,
	  - Nutrition and growth,
	  - Cognitive development,
	  - Socio-affective development
	- Physical and sexual abuse in the institution, all of which are more during infancy and early years of life.
	- Poor utilisation of healthcare facilities:
	  - Hospital care was sought for very few cases. This is of concern since most of the morbidities in children are accompanied by frequent complications, thereby increasing the morbidity burden further.
	  - Treatment seeking practices were found to be unsatisfactory with predominance of self treatment or using drugs without prescription either from local RMPs or upon pharmacists' advice.
	  - Orphanage staff may not be trained to identify development of danger signs which may pose grave risks to the children.
	- Lack of proper certified and approved measurement tools. The uncertainty abounding in the efficiency of these organisations, especially in third world countries, have led researchers to devise proxy indicators for estimating efficiency and quality through assessment of health status, among other indicators, of the residents. Valid measures, required for planning promotional measures for the welfare of orphaned children, requires reliable data on their health and nutrition status. Such data was grossly deficient from different parts of the country, more so from South India.
- According to Rainbow Homes, street children are at a higher risk for health concerns[^2]
	- Homelessness is a significant predictor of health status.
	- Yuva studies show that children on the streets have higher incidence of trauma related injuries, development delays, sinusitis, anaemia and asthma, eczema, visual and neurological deficits as well as other disabilities.
	- Hunger and malnutrition is very common. They are undernourished and stunted
	- Run away youth are its significant risk violence and victimisation substance abuse pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases
	- They do not have access to comprehensive health services immunization routine child health surveillance and health promotion.
	- Studies on Street children in India show that the children experience high rates of physical emotional and mental health problems
	- Their intake of food is inadequate and the quality of food is poor.
	- In many cases they have sexually transmitted infections mental health status is unknown depression and society and low self esteem or very common
- In another study on the American foster care system[^7], 
	- Thirty percent to 60% of children in foster care have been estimated to have chronic health conditions. When behavioral, emotional, and developmental concerns are taken into consideration, the estimated proportion of foster children with serious health care needs jumps to â¬Ž80%.
	- Caregivers reported that 50.3% of the children had less than or equal to 1 SHCN at some point during the 3-year study period.
	- At baseline, 35.1% of children were reported to have had SHCNs. Thirty-one percent were reported to have had SHCNs at the 1.5-year follow-up, and 33.5% were reported to have had SHCNs at the 3.0-year follow-up.
	- Boys were significantly more likely than girls to have had SHCNs, and children aged 0 to 2 years at baseline were significantly less likely to have had SHCNs than older children.
	- Adopted and foster children were significantly more likely to have had SHCNs than children in other living arrangements.
	- Overall, 56.1% of children with either form of SHCN had 1 or less than 1 of the 7 developmental problems
	- Especially high rates of SHCNs in this target population seem to stem from the preponderance of developmental and behavioral needs. Children in the CWS show much higher rates of special needs than children in the general US population.
	- Our data suggest that the children with SHCNs in this sample were at substantially high risk for a variety of cognitive and behavioral impairments.
	- NSCAW includes 2 indicators of SHCNs: 
- the presence of a chronic health condition and the presence of special needs
- These children who have a special health care need are also at an increased risk for chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional conditions requiring extensive health and related services. The two main types of Special health care needs are:
	### Chronic health Conditions:

  - As for chronic health conditions, 27.9% of children had ever had one. children aged 0 to 2 years at baseline were significantly more likely to have had a chronic health condition than children aged 6 to 10 years at baseline.
  - Children with a chronic health condition were significantly more likely than children without SHCNs to have a score in the clinical range in the cognitive, adaptive, behavioral, social skill, and maths and reading areas.
  - Overall, 53.5% of children with chronic health conditions had a problem in less than or equal to 1 of these areas compared with 29.1% of children without special needs
	### Common Chronic health issues:
- The most commonly reported condition was asthma (8.0% and 8.5% at any given point). Overall, 12.8% of all of the children were reported to have had the condition over the course of 3 years.
    - A recent national study estimated that 13% of all children (younger than age 18 years) had at some point in their lives suffered from asthma
    - Other conditions less frequently reported over the course of 3 years included repeated ear infections (5.2%), other respiratory problems (4.7%), severe allergies (4.2%), epilepsy (1.9%), and eczema or other skin disease (2.0%).
	### Special Needs:
  - As reported by caregivers, 33.2% of children had a special need either currently or in the past. There were significant differences in having a special need by gender, age, poverty, and living arrangement.
  - Boys were significantly more likely than girls to have a special need, and children aged 0 to 2 years at baseline were significantly less likely to have a special need, compared with every other age group.
  - Children living at or below the poverty level at baseline were significantly more likely than children living above the poverty level at baseline to have had a special need.
  - Finally, adopted and foster children were more likely than children living at home to have had special needs
  - Children with a special need were significantly more likely than children without SHCNs to have any of the developmental problems. More than half (50.7%) of the children with special needs had a clinically significant score for behavioral problems.
  - Overall, 62.8% of children with special needs had less than or equal to 1 of these developmental problems compared with 29.1% of children without an SHCN..
	### Common Special Needs:
- The most common special need was a learning disability (10.4% and 13.7% at any given point). Overall, 20.6% of all of the children had learning disabilities over the course of 3 years.
    - Other commonly reported conditions over the 3-year study period included 14.1% of children with emotional disturbance, 12.3% with speech impairment, 2.4% with mental retardation, 2.0% with hearing impairment, 1.3% with autism, and 1.2% with vision impairment.
-   According to a meta analysis on institutionalisation[^9], they found significant physical development detriments in the lives of children in institutions, 
	- Dana Johnson and colleagues (Johnson et al., 1992) examined the medical condition of 65  previously institutionalized Romanian children who were adopted to the United States. 
	- They found that only 15% of these children were  considered physically healthy at the time of adoption. Convergent evidence for this finding comes from the Romanian children adopted to Canada (Fisher et al., 1997).
	-  In this sample, 85% of children had a reported medical problem
	- Similarly, Hostetter, Iverson, Thomas,  McKenzie, Dole, and Johnson (1991) found that at least one medical problem was reported for a majority of children adopted from 15 countries in East and South Asia, Central and South America, Africa, and the Caribbean and Pacific Islands. 
	- Fisher et al. (1997) found that according to their parentsâ€™ reports orphanage childrenâ€™s most common medical problems when they were first adopted were
		-  intestinal parasites (31% of children),
		-  hepatitis B (28% of children) 
		-  anemia (15% of children). 
	- These medical problems are consistent  with those noted by other researchers who have examined medical problems in previously institutionalized children from Romania (Benoit, Jocelyn, Moddeman, & Embree, 1996; Gyorkos & MacLean, 1992; Jenista, 1992;  Marcovitch, Cesaroni, Roberts, & Swanson, 1995) and from several other countries (Hoksbergen, 1981; Hostetter et al. 1991). 
	-  Previously institutionalized children are typically small and malnourished after the orphanage experience. [Nutrition](Roll%20Ups/Nutrition/Nutrition.md)
		- Eighty-five percent of  orphanage children in the Canadian sample below the 10th percentile and 59% of children fell below the 5th percentile for weight (Morison et al., 1995). 
		- In another group of 16 Romanian children adopted to Canada, 50%  were below the 5th percentile for weight and  44% were below the 5th percentile for height (Benoit et al., 1996). Similarly, in the U.K
		-  In the UK sample of Romanian adoptees, Rutter and the ERA Study Team (1998) reported that half of  the children had heights, weights, and head  circumferences below the 3 percentile.
		-   In several studies growth retardation in height has been shown to be associated with the  length of time that children had spent in institutions (Ames, 1997; Johnson et al., 1992;  Rutter & the ERA Study Team, 1998). 
- According to another review paper covering papers on institutional care in CCIs[^8], Common illnesses observed were 
	- children having three or more parasites
	- skin infections
	- varicellazoster
	- tuberculosis
	- impetigo
	- dentalissues
	- ear/nose/throat problems
	- respiratory infections
	- diarrhoea
- 10-31% of children had skin conditions or infections
- 75% of children had an infection within the first three months of admission to a site(Kapavarapuetal.,2012)
- Anemia prevelance ranged from 3-90%
- 33% of children had low vitamin D
- Common deficiencies were iodine, zinc, albumin , vitamin A and B
- Edema, Conjunctival pallor, xerophthalmia and goiter were also found
Physical development in institutionalised vs. foster care children:

- Profound growth failure is a hallmark of institutional care in early childhood. The current study demonstrates that a small number of caregiving disruptions within foster care, which adults may view as trivial and even routine, can have significant additional effects on child wellbeing. The stress of having to accommodate changing care environments alters normal developmental processes and changes outcome for the worse.
- From an RCT that looked at 114 institutionalised children in the US, we can see that in comparison to foster group, the institutionalised group does worse off 
	- Profound growth failure is a hallmark of institutional care in early childhood. The current study demonstrates that a small number of caregiving disruptions within foster care, which adults may view as trivial and even routine, can have significant additional effects on child wellbeing. The stress of having to accommodate changing care environments alters normal developmental processes and changes outcome for the worse.
	- Compared with the institutionalized group, the foster care group showed greater rates of growth for height, weight, and BMI from baseline to age 12 years.
	- Increasing disruptions in the caregiving environment were related to decreasing rates of growth in height in foster care group and weight in institutionalized group and foster care group, but not BMI.
	- Aside from group differences in growth, the compromised height and weight growth patterns linked to individual differences in caregiver disruptions in foster care group underscore the importance of a consistent caregiving environment for child well-being.

### Common Infections:

- **Skin Infections:** Skin infections were reported most commonly followed by common cold and fever. A previous study done on orphans in the Southern state of Tamil Nadu similarly reported high prevalence of skin infections including pediculosis (25%) and oro-dental problems including dental caries (50%).
- **Eye Infections:** Infections of the eye were the lowest in prevalence. Similar prevalence of ear conditions was also reported. They however, also reported ophthalmic problems including Bitots spots which we did not find in our population.
- **Diarrheal disease and Respiratory Infections:** Some studies done on children residing in urban slums where prevalence of diarrheal disease and respiratory infections has been reported to be higher than our population

# Challenges to existing data 
According to a study conducted by the Duke Public Health Centre[^10], 
- Policy documents and legislation related to the care of children in institutions frequently cite studies of children who as infants lived in socially and emotionally deprived institutions in Romania and Russia.
  - These studies demonstrated powerful negative effects on the infant brain and child development .
  - When infants were removed from this environment to live with trained, paid, and supervised foster parents in Romania, brain and child development improvements were observed.
- In a meta-analysis of studies examining children in institutional and family care it was found that while intelligence quotient values trended toward being lower among infants in institutions, this relationship was not observed in lower income countries like Ethiopia , Kenya, and Eritrea, and was not observed among children over age five
- Recent assessments of children's nutritional status in Kenya  and of psychosocial status in China found children in group homes were doing somewhat better than their family-based comparisons
- The Positive Outcomes for Orphans (POFO) study is the only that enrolled a statistically representative sample of both institution-based and family-based orphaned and separated children (OSC) from culturally diverse sites across multiple LMICs
  - Cross-sectional analyses of baseline data found that health, emotional functioning, learning ability, memory, and physical growth were comparable, on average, for the 1,357 children living in 83 institutional care settings and the 1,480 children living with families in 311 community clusters (geographically bounded sampling areas) in the same regions.
# Rights Bases Approach to Health 
[^1]
According to the Kenyan Government, health needs to take a rights based approach
- Every child shall have equal rights, opportunities and responsibilities as any other child and shall be protected from all forms of discrimination.
- Every child shall have access to relevant health information, knowledge and skills that are appropriate for their age, gender, culture, language and context.
- Every child has a right to quality education. Access to education will continue to be facilitated for vulnerable groups (girls, orphans, children with disabilities and special needs).
- Children are the most vulnerable members of our society by virtue of their age and stage of growth. Therefore, their rights should be safeguarded and protected.
- The four key pillars of child rights as articulated in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC, 1989) and African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and as enshrined in the Kenya Children Act 2001. These include:
  
#### Survival rights:
- These include:
	- Adequate measures shall be put in place to provide both preventive and curative medical care for all children.
	- Feeding programmes shall be established and food supplements given to the vulnerable children especially those living in poverty and marginalized areas.
  
#### Developmental rights:

- To ensure that these rights are practised or respected we shall ensure that:
	- The IEC programme shall be developed and used to inculcate the importance of play and leisure for the continued holistic growth and development of th echild.
  
#### Protection rights:
- The following shall be assured:
	- Stringent enforcement of the existing protection measures against drug abuse by reinforcing the relevant section of the Children Act 2001
	- Provision of awareness campaigns on dangers of drug and substance abuse
	- Accessible and affordable rehabilitation and rescue centres for children in conflict with the law including those who abuse drugs
	- Provision of specialized staff in children institutions to detect and deal with drugs and substance abuse
	- Affordable specialized medical care for children addicted to drugs and other substance
	- Awareness campaign and information on the dangers of sexual exploitation
	- Provision of free medical treatment for all sexually abused children
	- Measures to discourage negative cultural beliefs and practices that support child marriages, child labour and Female Genital Mutilation
	- Life skills shall be part of the school curriculum
	- Peer education programme will be critical to improve effective communication.
	- Schools and the community shall plan and implement education programmes that promote positive socio-cultural behaviour among children
	- The school shall have adequate provisions for guidance and counselling services.
  
#### Participation Rights :

- Children are entitled to the freedom to express opinions and to have a say in matters affecting their social, economic, religious, cultural and political life.
    - Participation rights include the right to express opinions and be heard, the right to information and freedom of association.
    - Respecting these rights as they mature helps children bring about the realization of all their rights and prepares them for an active role in society.
    - As such school children shall be allowed to actively participate in all appropriate fora to express their opinions in matters affecting their health and education

## Declaration on child rights by the UN [^2]
Articles in the UN convention on the rights of the child relevant to the health of a child
- Article 2: a mentally or physically disabled child should enjoy a full and decent life in conditions which ensure your dignity promote self reliance and facility to child active participation in the community
- Article 24 the right of any child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health
- Article 25 the right of a child placed by competent authorities for the purposes of care protection of treatment of his or her physical or mental health to a periodic review of the treatment provided to the child
- Article 39 all appropriate measures to be taken to promote the physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of a child victim of any form of abuse and neglect

## Indian Rights Guaranteed
- The constitution of India article 15 guarantee special attention to children through necessary and special laws in policies that safeguard their rights
  - The directive principles of State policy in India says the state shall endeavor to achieve social and economic welfare of the people by guarding the children against exploitation and moral degradation
- National commission for protection of child rights march set up in 2007 ensure the policies programs and administrative mechanisms are in consonance with the child rights perspectives
- The ICPS 2009 centrally sponsored scheme of women and child development to provide a safe and secure environment for children so that they do not become vulnerable to exploitation, neglect and abuse.
- The spirit of all declaration goes beyond physical health of a child and talks about his overall being. The concept of well being is very important in a program for child health.
- Children and young people need to develop healthy lifestyles and opportunities to achieve optimum health and well-being. This is a collective responsibility.

# Models of Health Care- An International and Domestic Comparison

## Global Comparison of Health Standards in Residential Care 

Rainbow[^2] Homes has documented different national standards for children in institutional care across multiple countries 
### India
- No documented protocols on health standards for children in India. 
- In India we have to have to build standards with specific understanding of children were homeless when developing health protocols for them. Set of underpinning principles on which services should be based as well as outline some key standards that need to be implemented

### Australia
  - Standard 4- each child and young person has an individualized plan that details the health education and other needs
  - Standard 5 -children and young people have their physical development psychosocial and mental health needs assessed and attended to in a timely way.
  - Health record relevant health information that is in a consolidated form that documents the child or young person state of health and identified needs.
  - Luminary help check to establish the ongoing relationship between child care and the primary health provider. 
  - Physical health development till and psychosocial and mental health domains is to be assessed. To ensure care and enable support of both the child in carer overtime.

### UK
- Should have a holistic health assessment on entering care
  - Assessment should be done by a suitably qualified medical practitioner
  - First assessment should result in a health plan and if a child has been already assist the new assessment should be to update based on the child change circumstance
  - Attention should be given to the continuity of previous plans and interventions
  - All health staff with information about child health should ensure that this is made available to the person undertaking the assessment as soon as possible
  - Health assessment needs to be a continuous process not an isolated event. It needs to have a flexible approach appropriate to the child and stage of development
  - Health plan should clearly set out objectives actions timescales responsibilities are arising from the health assessment
  - Health plan needs to be reviewed in line with statutory requirement timescale
  - health assessments must be taken twice a year annually for children and young people under five years
  - Balance the sensitive and confidential nature of the child and young persons health information

## Models of Care in Indian institutions

Rainbow[^2] Homes has documented different institutional standards for other domestic service providers to CNCP in India

### Health models in Sneh Ghars Delhi
- Coordinated by centre for equity studies there on homes for children in Delhi Hyderabad and Bengaluru.
- Homes in Delhi are in partnership with the Delhi government. It provides infrastructure NGO managers and funds the program.
- Approach is holistic balance maintained between preventive promotive and curative services
- #### Objectives
  - Ensure preventive promotive and curative physical and mental care of all children in residential care including immunization hygiene health education de addiction nutrition tracking individual and group counseling
  - Establish linkages with public and private health Care institutions and functionaries at the primary secondary and tertiary levels
  - Provide emergency curative health care support event to children on streets
  - Homes document and maintain record for each child
- #### Challenges
  - Homes given by Government are in bad condition
  - Severe constraint of space leading to health problems from overcrowding
  - They do not refuse any child Khushi entry into home does living conditions are unhygienic

### Health models in Rainbow Homes for street children Kolkata

- Run by Loreto convent Kolkata
- Use rainbow homes on their top floors
- Model where rainbow children are integrated into mainstream school and loreto convent School children participate in rainbow home programs
- A nurse is present throughout.
- Hygiene and quality of food is good
- Regular I eye and dental check up, no routine documentation
- Every child case history e and medical services availed are file in referral slips, doctor slips and prescriptions
- Contact is maintained with family and once a month there is a mandatory meeting between children and parents

# Health Approaches in Institutional settings
As documented by Rainbow homes [^2], there are different approaches to healthcare

### Medical approach
- heavily dependent on qualified medical practitioners services provide on a case by case basis.
- It is wasteful and over medical eyes is health issues

### Health worker approach 
- focus more on preventive and promotive aspects of health. 
- Primary needs are addressed at the level of a health worker.

### Balanced approach
- In this view all staff members are fundamentally health workers and need training
- Program should have thoroughly trained supervised supported health workers
- For health programmes, the home needs to set up a health management advisory committee including a doctor public health specialist on a voluntary basis. 
- The set up also includes Ayush Specialists to teach home health remedies
- While sitting up a help program math existing resources including friendly doctors government dispensaries health centers hospitals, information on existing government schemes like free beds.
- Maintain supportive network for reference financial aid and volunteer action

# Preventative Approaches
## Infection Control & Management 
## Screening & Regular Checks
 #### Under 5 : Focus should be on
  - Physical health growth, diet, immunization, teeth,
  - Experience of caring relationships and emotional well being
  - Monitoring development and milestones with respect to speech, language, motor skills. mission and hearing play pre literacy skills social and self help skills

- #### Middle years 5 to 10 years:Focus should be on
  - physical health and management of specific health conditions, growth monitoring, communication skills, selfcare ability to make relationships and to relate to peers,
  - mental and emotional health including depression, exercise, balance diet,
  - progress at School, awareness of basic safety issues,
  - cope with physical and emotional changes associated with puberty,
  - access to accurate and simple information about sexual activity immunization dental health experience of caring relationships

- ### Adolescence and leaving care 11 to 18 years
  - Ability to take responsibility for own health including management of specific health conditions communication and interpersonal skills education and social progress lifestyle including diet and physical activity
  - ensuring immunization are up-to-date mental and emotional health including depression understanding of issues relating to sexual and sexual activity
  - access to information and advice about health issues including this of alcohol and substance use to
  - have a full copy of the social care health records

### Health Planning, Implementation and Review

- Report should be brought out for every child after assessment to draw out health plan
- If there is a history of abuse if child is malnourished then it calls for immediate interventions
- Health worker should be aware of health plan of every child and must have a checklist of interventions and actions that need to be taken
- Protocols are mandatory for a child who enters the home
- A review of the child including self review needs to be done every 6 months
- This helps in following up action has been taken according to the plan and reassessment it can be then done
- For children who leave the home staff should get in touch with the child or family to ensure steps are taken according to the plan

### Contents of individual health file

- General assessment the child's detailed history
- Physical health assessment and medical records
- Psychosocial assessment
- Child's own assessment
- Growth chart
- Health plans and reviews



# Curative Approaches
## First Aid (just list the problems and one line)
- Objectives
  - To preserve life
  - To prevent further injury and deterioration of the condition
  - To put injured child under medical cover
- All staff should have first aid education
- First aider must have basic understanding of vital body organs and functions
- Basic principles of first aid are to become to observe situation associate carefully identify the nature of wellness and act quickly
- First aider should instruct someone to call for medical help when its urgent
- First aid kit should be adequately stocked at all times and it should be accessible for all staff
- First aid box should contain
  - Savlon bottles
  - Povidone iodine ointment
  - Diclofenac gel
  - Adhesive bandage
  - Gauze bandages
  - Elastic bandage cotton wool disposable surgical gloves scissors tweezers soap safety pin torch
- Safety protocol should be in place for residential homes

### Minor cuts and bleeding

- Aim is to prevent blood loss and minimize the shock that could result from bleeding
- Maintain good hygiene procedures to guard against cross infection between first aider and the child
- First aid for minor cuts-first aider should wash his hands, clean the cut if dirty under running water, pat dry with a sterile dressing, cover the cut temporally, then cover with sterile dressing or plaster
- First aid for severe bleeding -apply direct pressure for 5 minutes to the ground with a clean pad then give sterile dressing
- Injured limb -Raise injured limb and support it
- Nose Bleeding-
  - Reasons blood vessel rupture blow to the nose high blood pressure
  - First aid put the head forward breathe through the mouth not speak swallow cough fitter sniff pinch the soft part of the nose to exert pressure for 10 minutes once the bleeding stocks clean the area with lukewarm water finally the child should rest for few hours rests quietly for few hours make sure to check the blood pressure

### Burns and scalds

- First aid :cool the burn immediately under running water
  - continue to Pour water till the pain is relieved
  - make the child comfortable
  - remove any jewelry what you clothing from the affected area
  - if the burn is in a large area take the child to the causality immediately
- Clothing on fire :
  - stop the child from running or any movement
  - drop the child to the ground and rap in a tight coat curtain or blanket
  - roll the child along ground till flames have been extinguished
  - do not use lotions ointment screens and adhesive dressings on burns and do not break blisters

### Fracture

- Recognition recognise a fracture by looking for swelling and natural range of movement immobility grating noise deformity loss of strength twisting shortening or bending of limp
- first-aid support immobilize the part
- provide pain relief immediately seek medical help

### Eye infection or Splinter in the eye

- If it is a speck of dust eyelash extra rinse it off
- first aider should not touch anything that sticks to the eye but make sure the child gets medical attention quickly
- In case of blurred vision pain or discomfort or redness make the child sit down facing light examine every part of the eye if the object is visible wash it out

### Head injury

- Injuries may be associated with damages to the brain tissue or to blood vessels inside the skull
- it may produce concussion
  - concussion is usually temporary and is not associated with elastic damaged to the brain
- Compression is life threatening
  - possible signs: deteriorating level of response leaking watery fluid/blood from the ear and nose
  - unequal pupil size, paralysis down one side of body,high temperature, disorientation, immediate medical help because head injuries can be serious

### Choking

- Mild obstruction child able to speak cough or breathe
- severe obstruction- unable to speak try cough or breathe the child will eventually become unconscious
- First aid remove the obstruction of its Mild and if its severe give upto 5 back blows
- Heat exhaustion caused by laws of salt and water from body usually through excessive sweating recognition headache business conclusion loss of appetite nausea sweating with pale climate skin rapid weakening pulse shallow breathing and high fever first aid replay the lost body fluids and salt

### Heat Exhaustion

- Give plenty of water possible with the weak salt solution
- if the child response is declines then referred to doctor
- monitor and record all vital signs level of response- pulse, breathing rate
- be prepared to give chest compression and rescue breaths

### Animal bites, insect stings and allergic reactions

- Animal bites identify the animal
- First aid- wash the wound gently with soap
- apply pressure with a clean towel apply antibiotic ointment and apply sterile bandage
- keep the injury elevated about the heart level defer the child to hospital if the wound is Deep and gaping
- usually insect stings from bees wasp is not serious
- check for allergic reaction try to relieve any swelling in pain
- First aid - dont use tweezers, apply ice pack,
- sting to the mouth and throat can be dangerous
  - sucking on ice cube, sipping cold water will prevent swelling
  - if swelling starts to develop and breathing becomes difficult arrange for medical help immediately
- Allergic reaction
  - Recognition- impaired breathing range from tides to severe difficulty blotchy skin eruption swelling of the tongue throat puffiness around the eyes

### Seizures

- Protect the child from additional injury
- avoid fall by making the child lie down
- do not place anything in child's mouth
- Loose restrictive clothing place on one side to prevent swallowing
- clear the area around to prevent injury from sharp objects
- do not give food or medications during a seizure
- bserve all activity during the seizure including the time of seizure beginning
- When seizure is over clear secretion from the mouth
- monitor breathing, surrounding awareness, check for loss of control
  - check for injuries if the individual remain unconscious after seizure is over refer immediately to a hospital

### Poisoning

- Identify the type of poison and the wayt has entered the body
- Ingested poison -recognition include altered mental state, burns surround mouth, nausea vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea
- first aid should -save any vomitus and keep it with the child and seek immediate medical help
  - should not induce vomiting if a child is unresponsive all the child has instead acid a petroleum product
- Inhaled poison -recognition breathing difficulty, chest pain, burning sensation, headache
- first aid remove the child to fresh air immediately
- Absorbed poison- enters the body through skin
  - recognition- there could be liquid or powder on skin burns, itching and irritation, redness rashes blisters, remove the clothes of the child
  - remove the poison from the skin if the poison is a dry powder it could be brush stuff about
- Cover the skin area with a large amount of water

# Possible reasons for the high incidence of morbidity:

- **Poor living conditions and utilisation of facilities:** The high prevalence of common morbidities reported in the present study as well as the inadequate treatment seeking practices of orphanage heads reflects the poor living conditions and inadequate knowledge of common diseases and their treatment. It also shows the poor utilisation of healthcare facilities, although all had access to a doctor.
- **Lack of Awareness** : Many diseases were found to be present due to lack of awareness about disease causation. Further, none of the children knew about the complications of most diseases under study, even when they were suffering from it.
  - Knowledge of signs and symptoms of common childhood morbidities was low among resident children, especially for fevers, skin infections/ infestations and ear conditions.
  - None of the children knew the common conditions presenting with fever (including malaria, dengue, typhoid and others).
  - None of the children had heard about scabies earlier, and none considered otitis media to be a dangerous condition. Only two children who had previous pneumonia knew about common symptoms of the disease, but not complications.
  - None of the children were aware that worm infestation could occur through faeco-oral route
- **Poor nutrition:** Poor nutritional status has been shown to be widely prevalent and directly associated with morbidities among institutionalised children. Further, the poor nutritional status of the children may have an impact on their cognition levels which may worsen their awareness and treatment seeking practices. Vaida et al reported the contrary by showing the majority of orphan children having normal nutritional status, with no clear relationship between orphan-hood and the nutritional status of children compared with those who lived with their parents.
- **Low immunity at younger age:** We also found the morbidities to be higher among younger age groups which may be explained by their lower immunity levels and young age as a risk factor for most diseases.
