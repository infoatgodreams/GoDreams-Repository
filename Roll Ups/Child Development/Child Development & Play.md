# Principles of development
According to a paper on development[^8], Several recurring developmental principles or themes are important to keep in mind when defining normal development and identifying growth processes and milestones

### Nature and nurture
* There is an interaction between nature and nurture, that influences development
* For mental health professionals, it is necessary to consider the extent of their child clients’ normal or atypical development, it is important to recognize the complex interplay of nature and nurture and how this contributes to the clients’ clinical presentations.

### Developmental timing and plasticity
* Normal child development occurs on a continuum, ranging from children whose physical, cognitive, social-emotional, and behavioral development may lag behind those of their peers, to children who are precocious, meeting or surpassing developmental milestones before most children their age. Even still, a majority of children who develop slightly earlier or later than their peers may do so within a “normal” timeframe.
* It is useful to keep in mind that, barring early mental or physical disorders, lapses in development and deviations from the norm at different points in time are not necessarily predictive of subsequent developmental deficits or delays. Instead, children typically continue to grow and change. 
* Traits or skills can be altered throughout the lifespan although they typically are more malleable earlier in development. This notion of plasticity is an important characteristic of normal child development. 

### Critical and sensitive periods
* Critical period: A critical period is a limited time that begins and ends abruptly during which a specific function develops. If the conditions for development are not available during that time it may be extremely difficult or even impossible to develop these functions later in life. 
* Sensitive period: A sensitive period is a time when it is easiest for children to acquire certain skills. It is similar to a critical period in that it is a time of optimal development, but it is best understood as a time of maximum sensitivity that begins and ends more gradually and is more amenable to recovery

### Role of culture and context
* development may vary considerably within and across racial/ethnic and cultural groups. 
* They may also vary according to other contextual differences including historical era, community, or socioeconomic status.
* Nature and timing of some capabilities are less likely to vary across context, particularly in physical and cognitive domains. Skills and behaviors— such as cooing and babbling, initiation of speech, or the ability to use abstract reasoning—develop in a more species-specific pattern; they are all capabilities that are unlikely to differ cross-culturally


# Domains of Development
According to a paper on development, we learn about the different types of development to pay attention to[^8], 


### Cognitive development 
- focuses on changes and growth in internal mental processes, such as -concrete and abstract thinking, reasoning, problem-solving, memorizing, recalling, planning, imaging, and creating.

### Linguistic development
* linguistic development domain references the child’s communication skills, developing speech patterns, and sentence structuring.

### Social-emotional development
* The social-emotional domain involves the development of relationships with others and the learning of social norms and customs, as well as growth in the ability to identify, understand, express, and modulate one’s feelings. 

### Behavioral development
* Behavioral milestones refer broadly to the child’s development of age-appropriate behavior, such as - following rules/regulating deviant behavior.


# Young Adult Development  Model 
According to this framework published by the Young Adult Success Project at UChicago,  The young adult success model posits three factors that are most directly related to positive outcomes in young adulthood
- competencies, complex sets of abilities that allow individuals to perform roles, navigate contexts and adapt to different needs and demands
- integrated identity, a coherent sense of self across time, contexts and include multiple aspects of one’s identity and
	- agency, the ability to determine one’s own life path rather than being subject to external forces

## Settings that favour development
- physical and psychological safety
- appropriate structure
- supportive relationships
- opportunities to belong
- positive social norms
- support of efficacy and mattering
- opportunities for skill-building and
- integration across multiple contexts 


# Impact of Institutionalisation

According to a meta-analysis of over 70 years of intervention studies on cognitive development, these are the common failings in institutional care[^1]
- Orphanages usually do not meet the conditions of the average expectable environment, a prerequisite for children’s normal development, encompassing protective, stable caregiving and open opportunities for exploration and mastery of the world. 
- In this respect, institutional care implies structural neglect. Numerous studies have shown that children growing up in orphanages are at risk in various domains of functioning, including their physical, socio-emotional and cognitive development

## Impact of Parent-Child Separation
- According to a paper on the developmental effects of parent-child separation[^3], we learn that 
	- Experiencing persecution, conflict, war, or disaster in childhood has well-documented negative impacts on children’s health, learning, well-being, and educational progress.
	- Separation of children and parents in these contexts both removes this important source of mitigating adversity and compounds the stress and trauma that a child experiences, amounting to a potentially devastating developmental and psychological impact.
	- Disruptions in attachment were therefore conceptualized as the key mechanism linking parent-child separation to emotional and behavioural problems.
		- Secure attachment, for example, was found to protect against the vulnerabilities posed by institutionalization, early deprivation such as household income poverty, and other risks experienced during childhood.
	- There is evidence of disruptions in adult–child relationships, peer relationships, and physiological processes as mechanisms because of parental separation


## Effect of Trauma on Development
From a review on the impact of trauma on child development, we now know that
- #### General cognitive and language delay
	- On the whole, children exposed to neglect may be more vulnerable to general delays in cognitive and language development.  Neglected children and those raised in poverty may be more at risk of general cognitive delay than those exposed to abuse 
	- Among abused children, increasing severity of abuse is associated with lowered IQ relative to matched controls 
	- The presence of PTSD appears to affect cognitive functioning. Studies show that children with PTSD subsequent to abuse have lower verbal IQ on assessment, suggesting that the presence of PTSD rather than abuse _per se_ may be more relevant
	- The IQ scores of those children exposed to domestic violence was found to be eight points lower than children who were not exposed to violence; after controlling for the effects of genetics and other forms of maltreatment

- #### Problems with memory: 
	- There is reasonable evidence that memory is affected by trauma and adversity. Brain structures that are associated with memory consolidation have been found to differ in adults (but not children) who report a history of abuse.

- #### Bias in the processing of social/emotional information
	- There is some evidence that social and emotional information is processed differently among children that have experienced abuse. The amygdala, an area of the brain associated with the automatic (pre-conscious) processing of emotional information, has been shown to be over-responsive to emotional stimuli (e.g., angry faces) in studies of abused children

- ##### Metacognitive skills
	- Neuropsychological research suggests that children who have experienced neglect and physical abuse can experience problems in auditory attention and cognitive flexibility (problem-solving and planning)

- ##### Behavioural regulation
	- Compared to non-neglected peers, emotionally neglected children may have less efficient brain activity during tasks that require inhibitory control, suggesting that neglect is associated with poor ability to self-regulate and inhibit responses



## Physical Development Delays
### Height & Weight
- According to a meta analysis on interventions to improve development outcomes in children[^1], 
	- With regard to physical development, institutional care has shown dramatic negative effects on growth, with a major affect, reflecting the association between height and duration of stay in the orphanage
	- Often it is not (only) deficiencies in nutrition or medical care that cause growth retardation, but that these growth delays are also the result of socio-emotional neglect.
- According to a paper on caregiving disruptions and their effect on development, we see that[^2]
	- Increasing disruptions in the caregiving environment were related to decreasing rates of growth in height in foster care group and weight in institutionalized group and foster care group, but not BMI.

### Occipital frontal circumference (OFC)
- According to a paper on caregiving disruptions and their effect on development, we see that[^2]
  - Despite placement in a more stable, nurturing, and stimulating environment, head circumference, a surrogate for brain size, did not significantly improve in foster care group between baseline and 12 years.



## Cognitive Development Delays
- According to a meta analysis on interventions to improve development outcomes in children[^1]
	- Children living in orphanages are often markedly delayed, to the point of apparent mental retardation that disappears with improving environments. 
	- The absolute difference in IQ between institutionalized and family-reared children of 20 IQ points. 
- According to a paper that studied IQ in children in institutional care in the North-West in India, the institutionalized males as well as females reported lower IQ.  More than half of the institutionalized subjects were significantly below the average IQ levels (IQ below 70). 
- According to a paper on the developmental effects of parent-child separation[^3]
	-  we learn that the impact includes poorer brain functioning, smaller brain size, lower levels of cognition, and elevated social/behavioural problems, specifically disinhibition, inattention, hyperactivity, and attachment disruptions.
	- At age 16, early-emerging deficits in problem-solving, attention, spatial planning, and short-term visual attention persisted into adolescence, and the gap in spatial working memory between once-institutionalized and never-institutionalized children widened in comparison to earlier in childhood.
- According to a paper that studied impact of institutionalisation on child development[^12], 
	-  Morison et al. (1995) found that 78%  of orphanage children were **delayed in all four  areas of development (personal–social, gross  motor, fine motor–adaptive, and language development)** 


## Pubertal Development 
- According to a paper on caregiving disruptions and their effect on development, we see that[^2]
	- Institutionalized group boys showed lower Tanner scores compared with foster care group and family care group. *The Tanner scale (also known as the Tanner stages or Sexual Maturity Rating (SMR)) is a scale of physical development in children, adolescents and adults. The scale defines physical measurements of development based on external primary and secondary sex characteristics, such as the size of the breasts, genitals, testicular volume and development of pubic hair.* 
	- A previous survey of pubertal development in children experiencing severe deprivation within Romanian orphanages revealed that the onset of puberty was delayed by approximately 2.5 years in girls and 1.5 years in boys.
	- Despite expectations of altered pubertal tempo, the only difference noted was that Tanner scores at age 12 years in institutionalized group boys were lower compared with both foster care group and family care group boys. Tanner development and age of menarche were comparable among girls in institutionalized group, foster care group, and family care group.


## Pyschosocial Development Delays
- According to a paper that sudies the developmental effects of parental separation, when there is volitional separation (parents leave for better pastures), we see that 
	- children separated from their mothers for 4 years or longer reported significantly higher-level anxiety and depression symptoms than those who were never separated, controlling for developmental level and country of origin.
	- Children who were left behind by migrating parents had poorer school performance; increased feelings of abandonment, anger, and loneliness; and more sleep complaints.
- According to a paper on the Petersburg-USA orphanage study[^5], 
	- Children assessed in adolescence had the highest levels of problems. This was true across all subscales of the CBCL [Child Behavior Checklist], with the highest rates for attention and externalizing problems.
	- This suggests the possibility of a single mechanism underlying the development of persistent behavior problems, perhaps the neurobiological consequences of chronic stress in the institution. 
	- Similar to the results for behavior problems, social skills were worse for later-adopted children, and the relation was again a step-like increase at an age-at-adoption of 18 months.
- According to a paper on the consequences of early institutionalisation[^11], 
	- Institutionalized children also commonly display certain specific behaviors that are rare among parent-reared children, such as:
		- stereotypies or self-stimulation (e.g., rocking, head banging, arm waving). 			-  *In the general absence of sensory stimulation  and soothing by adults, for example, by rocking, children may learn to provide their own  stimulation or soothing by making stereotyped movements.* 
		- problems with attention and activity control, 
		- internalizing and externalizing behavior, 
		- high rates of disorganized or unscoreable attachment on the Strange Situation Procedure, 
		- and indiscriminate friendliness.
	- According to a paper on the impact of institutionalisation on child development, 			the unwillingness to interact with peers further prevents them  from learning normal patterns of social interaction. When they do become comfortable  enough to interact with peers in their new environment, they externalize (“act out”) in unacceptable ways that do not endear them to those peers. 
		- Children in residential care were also found to have difficulties in both the affective and cognitive dimensions of empathy, and they manifested low levels of empathic stress and empathic joy, which resulted in a coping style oriented towards the self


## Executive Function Delays
- [^5]Older-adopted children displayed lower inhibitory control and poorer working memory than children adopted at younger ages, but the groups did not differ significantly on a spatial self-ordered search task, which measures spatial working memory. 
- Children with this kind of difficulty can benefit from highly structured environments where expectations are clear. 
- They can benefit from prompts to stay on task and the use of pre-arranged strategies to let them know when a transition is pending. These can include advanced warnings, using timers, and visual cues (e.g., paper chain links or a timer to count down to the end of an activity).


## Language Development Delays
- According to the study on St. Petersburg USA Orphanage intervention[^5], Children adopted before 12 months of age displayed levels of expressive and receptive language skills
- In contrast, language proficiency was lower for children adopted after 12 months of age in both the expressive and receptive domains. 
- Language acquisition delays (i.e., delays in developing speech and vocabulary) mean that affected children may struggle with verbally mediated counselling approaches that rely on oral language competence, such as narrative therapies and restorative justice approaches.



# Reasons for delayed cognitive development in institutions

## Care in large groups:
- In a groundbreaking intervention study, Groark, Muhamedrahimov, Palmov, Nikiforova, and McCall (2005) demonstrated that promoting caregiver sensitivity leads to better socioemotional and cognitive development of the children involved and a better atmosphere in the groups consisting of children of differing ages. 
- Caregiver-child ratio might also be important. Groark and colleagues (2005) managed to decrease the number of children per caregiver, which promoted children’s development significantly.
- Children with the most favorable caregiver-child ratio (maximally three children per caregiver) did not significantly lag behind their peers reared in families. This means that in residential care with small groups intellectual development of the pupils may not lag behind substantially.
- According to a paper on the consequences of early institutionalisation, 
    * Children: caregiver ratios tend to be high, roughly 6–8  to 1, and sometimes higher, even in wards of young infants.
    *  Further, there are many and changing caregivers, some of whom may work long shifts (24 hours) and then are off for three days. This caregiver scheduling, turnover, vacations that may be as high as 50–60 days per year, plus ward transitions mean that children can experience 60–100 different caregivers by the time they are 19 months old (St. Petersburg-USA Orphanage Research Team, 2008). 
    * Finally, and perhaps most importantly, caregiver-child interactions tend to be limited, perfunctory, and business-like with a minimum of warm, sensitive, responsive interactions.

## Poor environments: 
- In less-developed countries the discrepancies between the IQ of residential and family-reared children was indeed largest. 
-  In the latter countries the IQ delays were negligible, perhaps because of the extreme poor living conditions for both categories of children (family reared and orphanage-reared) in those African countries. 
- Wolff (1995) even suggested that in Eritrea children living in orphanages were better off than children reared by their parents.
- Similarly, Kodero (2001) found that AIDS/HIV orphans in Kenya received better care in children’s homes than in other forms of care, including care by the extended family.

## Lack of challenging stimuli:
- The stimulus deprivation theory (Casler, 1961) suggests that the lack of physical and social stimuli of any kind may be the most important cause of intellectual delays, and enriching the orphanage environment would result in better intellectual development.
- Cognitive stimulation may be another important factor in children’s homes. Morison, Chisholm, and Ames (1995) showed that with an increasing amount of play materials, developmental delays decreased in children adopted from orphanages (see also Kaler & Freeman, 1994).

## Lack of stable attachments
- The maternal deprivation concept (Bowlby, 1951) states that a stable and continuous attachment relationship with a sensitive caregiver is essential for socioemotional as well as for intellectual development. 
- If this is true, children’s homes with more sensitive caregivers and smaller groups might be less damaging to intellectual development.

## Age of children and duration of stay:
- Age of the children and the duration of their stay in the orphanage may also play a role in the degree to which gjusroup care affects children’s intellectual development. One would expect that younger entry into the orphanage (Sloutsky, 1997) and a longer stay (Sloutsky, 1997; Spitz, 1945) would be more detrimental, but the evidence is equivocal



# Interventions to improve cognitive development in institutional care

## Six principles for supporting children in care 
- Provide safe environments and rich experiences that stimulate and enrich brain growth.
- Support children and caregivers to understand the link between traumatic events and cognitive difficulties.
- Develop and support positive relationships and connections in children's lives.
- Maintain targeted interventions throughout childhood and adolescence.
- Offer all children in care targeted and trauma-specific interventions.
- Ensure that specific cognitive difficulties are addressed directly.

## Foster Care & Adoption
- [^1]In a randomized control trial the Bucharest Early Intervention Project showed that foster care as an intervention improved the cognitive outcome of children substantially (Nelson et al., 2007).
- The remarkable catch-up shown by adopted children in comparison with their peers who remain behind in institutional care (e.g., Rutter et al., 1998; Van IJzendoorn & Juffer, 2006) cannot for the greater part be ascribed to selection bias
- According to a paper that studied the effects of parental separation[^3], 
	- children who are placed in foster care before 24 months of age are more likely to have secure attachments despite their early time in institutional care 
	* show cognitive development scores in the normal range.
	* at 42 and 54 months old, children who had been placed in foster care showed cognitive gains over their peers who remained in orphanages.
	* Placement in foster care also improves electroencephalogram measures of brain activity, relative to those who remained in institutional care.

## School-Based Interventions:
According to a paper on developmental consequences of parent-child separation[^3], 
**Classroom-based interventions can be feasibly implemented by nonspecialized, trained personnel.** 
- In a sample of left-behind adolescents, a teacher-student relationship positively predicted self-esteem and negatively predicted depression and problem behaviours.
* association between teacher-student relationship and depression was stronger among the left-behind group. 
* In India, a school-based intervention targeted Tibetan adolescents living in exile with limited family contact. This life skills training intervention, carried out with 300 adolescents aged 13–19 years, showed positive social and mental health impacts. This program reduced youth reports of stress related to, school, leisure and the future through various skill-based course topics such as creative thinking, critical thinking, effective communication, empathy, and decision making.
* School-based cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) group intervention in two schools in London for traumatized refugee or asylum-seeking children from countries affected by war. Teachers identified participants based on students’ classroom behaviour and their disclosure of traumatic events. The intervention reduced overall and intrusive PTSD symptoms and increased improvements in behaviour, as indicated by a teacher measure.

## Community-Based Interventions
According to a paper on developmental consequences of parent-child separation[^3], 
**Group interventions may be an effective way to target multiple youths who have experienced loss and separation in a single setting while facilitating social interaction with others facing a similar experience.**
- Utilizing preexisting community and social services and programming might be an effective way to leverage systems that are already in place to reach those separated from a caregiver.

### Children Companion Mothers Program (CCMP)
- The community-based intervention, the Children Companion Mothers Program (CCMP), took place over 3 years. 
- As part of the intervention, each participating village had a physical space for children to attend after-school activities; a paid, full-time program employee providing welfare services and program access to children; and a commitment of local governing institutions and authorities to collaboratively solve issues faced by left-behind children, as identified by the village program employee. 
- Overall, results suggest that this community-level approach may have reduced disparities between left-behind and non-left-behind groups as shown by CCMP participants’ levels on various well-being indicators.
* CCMP participants exhibited higher resilience, safety awareness, and communicative competence as well as better academic performance, guardianship, and physical health habits than participants in the control group, according to self-report measures. 

### Youth Readiness Intervention
- Youth Readiness Intervention, which integrated CBT and interpersonal therapy developed for 15- to 24-year-olds in a randomized controlled trial.
* Program outreach, recruitment, and implementation were done at the community level, and the 10–12 intervention sessions at times involved family and community members as a way to foster engagement and establish a support system.
* improved with regard to emotion regulation and prosocial behaviour, as well as educational engagement, like attendance and enrollment, according to a teacher survey (classroom performance scale) and youth report. 


## St Petersburg USA Orphanage Intervention Research [^5]
### Research structure 
* Each institution was assigned to a different condition: Training plus Structural Changes** (T+SC), **training but no structural changes or Training Only **(TO), **no Intervention or care-as-usual** (NoI). 
* Training: Training consisted of 12–14 sessions (approximately 60 h total) teaching caregivers to interact with children in a more “parent-like” manner by providing more warm, sensitive, and contingently responsive care to children.
* Structural changes: Were designed to create a more “family-like” environment within the institution. These changes were designed to support caregiver–child interactions and relationships, and included reducing the number of caregivers per group, appointing primary caregivers who worked more consistently during the week, reducing group sizes, integrating groups by age and disability status, stopping periodic “graduations” of children to new rooms with new caregivers and peers, appointing a few consistent substitute caregivers for each group, and establishing “family hour” twice daily in which visitors were prohibited and children spent time with their caregivers.

### Success of the intervention
- Specific areas of improvement included physical growth, cognitive and social-emotional development, and attachment quality to caregivers. 
- Behavioral and mental development were assessed with the Battelle Developmental Inventory increased perhaps the largest average increase in behavioral/mental development observed for any intervention in the literature. 
- Children improved more the longer they resided in the intervention institutions, and this was true for children with and without disabilities.
- Children in the intervention institutions also gained more than those in NoI in height, weight, and chest circumference, and they progressively displayed fewer functional limitations; again gains were greater the longer children were in the intervention. 
- In caregiver-child free play sessions, typically developing T +SC and TO children displayed a higher quality of play, alertness, and self-regulation than NoI, and T +SC children showed more positive affect, social initiative, and communication than TO and NoI children – again more the longer they were in the intervention

### Sustaining the success of this intervention
- According to a paper[^7] on the benefits of maintaining a socioemotional intervention in institutional settings, we learn about the different maintenance activities used to continue the initial success of the intervention:
	- The original intervention involved several components thought to promote maintenance. First, the double intervention was implemented in a BH in which the director was thoroughly committed to implementing and maintaining the intervention and insisted that her staff do so.
	- Second, although the intervention project provided substantial resources to this BH including some funds to hire additional caregivers, the intervention was designed to reduce the number of different caregivers in children’s lives but not to increase the number of caregiver hours available to children.
	- Third, a train-the-trainer strategy was adopted so that training personnel were continually available to prepare new caregivers who replaced those who left during and after the intervention
	- Fourth, an in-house monitoring and supervision system was established in which specialists (e.g., staff professionals in children with disabilities, early education) were responsible for monitoring the caregivers and encouraging them to implement the training on the wards on a continuing basis.
	- Furthermore, following the end of the intervention project, additional coaching and technical assistance were provided by author Palmov and two other professionals to both Training + Structural Changes and TO, which consisted of weekly or bimonthly visitations, supervision, and periodic refresher training.

### Larger recommendations from this intervention
* The St. Petersburg intervention demonstrates that institutions do not need to operate in the way most do and that encouraging caregivers to interact more appropriately with children in an environment that is made more family-like can produce very substantial improvements in the development of resident infants and toddlers
*  Interestingly, the DQs of children in all three institutions improved over the six-year period, perhaps because fewer children were sent to institutions but staff levels remained the same producing smaller groups and fewer children per caregiver in all three of the institutions (McCall et al., in press).
* These results and those of similar interventions indicate that institutions can be improved; the improvements can produce substantial increases in physical, mental, social, and behavioral development in both typically developing children and those with disabilities; and such benefits can be maintained for at least six years with no additional funds


### The Bucharest Early Intervention Project (BEIP)
- [^15][[The Bucharest Early Intervention Project]] ( has begun providing a foster care inter-  vention in Bucharest, Romania, in which they  are following the development of children removed from orphanage to foster care and comparing their developmental progress to both children who remain in orphanage and a community comparison group. 
- The study showed that high-quality foster care has the potential of improving children’s development relative to the typical institutional environment

### Study Design
- Children in the BEIP were randomized into either the ‘Care As Usual Group’ (CAUG) (the group who remained in institutional care), or ‘High Quality Foster Care Group’(FCG), and a comparison group of non-institutionally raised children were matched by age and gender

### Study findings
- No biological differences between children who were raised in institutional environments and those in the comparison group who had never been cared for in an institutional environment ,nor with those who had been randomised to high quality foster care.
- Lower IQ scores for both FCG and CAUG as compared to the comparison group.
- Higher levels of callous-unemotional traits among children who experienced any institutional care as opposed to the comparison group. *(Callous-unemotional (CU) traits comprise a temperament dimension characterized by low empathy, interpersonal callousness, restricted affect and a lack of concern for performance.)*
- Children in the FCG were more likely to display adaptive functioning than those in the CAUG (*Adaptive functioning means how well a person handles common demands in life and how independent they are compared to others of a similar age and background)
- Higher psychopathology among those in CAUG and the FCG compared to the comparison group at ages 8, 12, and 16. The FCG had significantly lower psychopathology than the CAUG at age 16. 
- Particularly high rates of attention problems, poor self-regulation, attachment disorders and anxiety are noted among those who experienced institutional care.
- Children who experienced institutional care had reduced cognitive processing speed compared to the comparison group.
- However,both the wealth of evidence from the BEIP (using a strong RCT methodology), and more piece meal evidence from other comparative studies, indicate that children and young people who are either initiallyplaced, or subsequently move to, family based environments are able to match children who were neverremoved from the home, and make up ground on disadvantages they may have experienced uponplacement


## Hodges and Tizard Study
A paper on the impact of institutionalisation on IQ covers this important study that shows that  institutionalized children were not destined for developmental compromise. They studied children who had spent the first 2 years of their lives in high-quality institutions in the United Kingdom (Tizard, 1977).
- In these institutions the child to caregiver ratios were 3:1 and the were taken on outings, and were fed well.
- The major way in which orphanage children’s lives differed from the lives of home-reared children was that caregivers were discouraged from forming intimate relationships with them (Tizard & Tizard, 1971). 
- Tizard and Joseph (1970) first assessed children in the institution when they were 2 years old and compared them to a sample of home-reared children from a working class background. 
- They found that the institution children’s [[IQ]] scores were only slightly lower than those of the working class children and that their language was only slightly delayed. 
- At age 4.5 the mean [IQ](IQ.md) of the children in an institution was in the average range and no language problems were found (Tizard & Rees, 1974). 
- Hodges and Tizard (1989) reported that children adopted from the institution had normal [IQ](IQ.md)s at 8 and 16 years of age. Tizard’s findings were more positive than the findings of the earlier search, but it is important to note that the children in Tizard’s sample had not experienced the extreme deprivation experienced by earlier samples of children  (e.g., Goldfarb, 1945a)

## Using Play to improve Cognition
- According to a paper on the relation of play and congition in institutional care[^13]
	- Play has been related to the development of both cognition and social competence
	- Play involved moving from learning schemes such as grasping or swinging an object, to new schemes involving higher levels of integration through pleasurable, spontaneous, and unorganized repetition and synthesis.
	- Studies describing play and its relationship to development have demonstrated associations with cognition, motor skills, language, sensory processing, socialization, affect, and disposition
	- Children cared for in institutions exhibited less exploratory play, less varied play, and developmentally lower levels of play than their home-reared peers. 
	- Findings suggest that cognitive development, as measured by the standardized BSID-II, is related to play behaviours. 

## Using Physical Exercise to improve Cognition
- According to a paper designed to understand if dance activities can improve cognitive performance, we find out that, 
	- Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown that the evidence for the long-term effects of structured exercise programs on children’s cognitive performance is inconclusive; some studies report positive effects, while others report no effects (see for reviews
	- Nevertheless, it can be concluded that increasing the time spent on exercise in school at the cost of academic lessons does not negatively impact children’s cognitive performance
	- The vast majority of studies that examined the long-term effects of exercise on cognitive performance of children have implemented extensive exercise interventions with durations of 30–60 min per session, mostly delivered three to five times a week. These studies are simply impractical in the context of institutions
	-  A study examined high intensity aerobic exercises or (2) high intensity combined aerobic and strength exercises were implemented three times per week in 14–16 years old adolescents. The exercise bouts were implemented once a week during recess and twice a week as part of the regular physical education (PE) classes. The authors found no significant differences in executive functioning between the intervention groups and the control group that followed the regular PE classes

## Trauma-based interventions
- Children in care are likely to have experienced a complex mix of neglect, trauma and adversity. There is an urgent need to develop tailored interventions for the difficulties faced by these children.
-  In the meantime, all children in care should be offered interventions based on the best current evidence, and that target trauma symptoms and cognitive skills.

### Targeted strategies include:
-   Trauma-Focused CBT 
		- At present, Trauma-Focused CBT is the approach that has most empirical support This trauma-specific intervention has also been shown to improve broad aspects of executive functioning such as cognitive skills and emotional regulation 
		- Therefore, until more tailored interventions are developed for the complex needs of children in care, trauma-specific therapy should be offered as part of the support plan for children who have been exposed to traumatic events
-   Dialectical Behaviour Therapy
-   interventions that focus on the development of specific cognitive skills


## Using Cognitive Therapies to improve cognitive outcomes in children
- According to a meta analysis on the Efficacy of Cognitive Training Programs in Children and Adolescents, 
	- Cognitive therapies are intended to improve basic cognitive functions, whatever the cause of the deficiency may be. Children and adolescents with various cognitive deficits are treated with behavioral therapeutic and computer-supported training programs.
	- Such training programs are used in children with the following disorders:
		-  Disturbances in mental development
		- Severe attention disorders 
		- Acquired cerebral function disorders or brain injury, also status post mild craniocerebral trauma
		-  Cognitive therapy and training programs are most frequently indicated in children with attention deficit disorders or attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADD/ADHD), where the efficacy of solely medicinal treatment has been questioned.

### Evidence-backed outcomes of cognitive therapy 
- Behaviour: The greatest effects were reported in the area of behavior/psychopathology
- Intelligence—The overall effect was slight.
- School performance—Here too, the effects were slight
- These interventions do not treat underlying diseases; rather, they train specific cognitive functions such as attention, memory, and executive functions, with the intention of improving skills at school and in daily life. 
- A meta-analysis showed no overall favorable effects of cognitive training programs on cognitive functions. Favorable effects on behavior were demonstrated but represent nonspecific effects of treatment.
- Clear-cut effects were demonstrated only for individual selected interventions and indications. This underlines the necessity of proper neuropsychological evaluation to identify the patients for whom cognitive training is indicated.


## Successful interventions in institutions include one or many of the following components: 
- According to a meta-analysis that described different interventions in instituional children, these components are seen in successful interventions that improve cognitive performance[^1],  
	- Regular visual and auditory stimulation 
	- Impersonal tactile stimulation
	- Decreased child-caregiver ratio
	- Personal relationship with one caregiver 
	- Increased caregiver stability 
	- Sensitive interaction with children
	- Personal care 
	- Pre-school attendance 
	- Impersonal stimulation of exploration 
	- Cognitive stimulation 
	- Structured play 



# Other factors that affect developmental outcomes
## Time & Timing
*Generally, the earlier and younger that children leave institutional care for stable foster care or adoption, the better it is for their outcomes and trajectory.*

 - According to a meta analysis on interventions to improve development outcomes in children[^1]
	- The timing of the intervention however made a significant difference. Interventions starting before the first birthday of the child were significantly more effective  than interventions starting at a later age. 
	- Effect of interventions decreased with increasing age of the children at the start of the intervention. 
	- Interventions with children younger than 12 months were more effective than interventions starting at a later age. Similar effects have been found for children’s physical growth
- According to a paper on the developmental effects of parental separation[^3], 
	- Length of time in an institution appears to be negatively associated with developmental outcomes.  
	- Cognitive recovery was inversely related to the length of stay in institutional care.
	- prolonged residence in orphanages led to higher neuropsychological deficits in memory, attention, and inhibitory control but similar levels to peers in auditory processing, rule acquisition, and planning
	- At 18 months of age or after, parasympathetic nervous system reactivity was negatively affected into early adolescence (age 12).
	- For children placed at or after 15 months old, expressive language and receptive language were negatively impacted into early childhood but not later.
	- When placed at or after 24 months of age, a child’s IQ, attachment organization, and security were negatively affected into early childhood. 
	- those placed before 30 months of age showed growth in their learning and visual-spatial memory such that they were indistinguishable from other children by age 16.

## Stability in Caregiving
- According to a paper that studies disruptions in caregiving and their effect on development in children[^2],  Aside from group differences in growth, the compromised height and weight growth patterns linked to individual differences in caregiver disruptions in foster care group underscore the importance of a consistent caregiving environment for child well-being.
- Thus, although we did not observe major changes in pubertal development among groups, caregiving disruptions deserve further investigation as a factor that could moderate changes in pubertal tempo in girls and boys.

## Quality of Caregiving
- According to a paper on the St. Petersburg USA Orphanage intervention research, 
	- Caregivers received little training, and most of their training pertained to routine caregiving and basic physical health
	- Caregivers rarely initiated or maintained reciprocal social interactions with children or provided physical affection. Instead, caregivers used directive language and focused on providing the necessities (feeding, changing diapers, bathing) in a business-like manner with little eye contact, talking, or playing. 
	- Thus, although the physical resources were adequate in these institutions, children had few warm, sensitive, and responsive interactions with a few consistent caregivers
- According to a paper that studied the impact of institutionalisation on child development,  In addition to the length of time in an institution, the availability of toys and having been a favorite in the institution were associated with fewer delays and higher scores on the Gesell scales, whereas being described as dirty when first met by parents was associated with more delays and lower Gesell scores

## Miscellaneous factors
*Didnt come across these factors in more detail in these readings. Might have been covered in other roll-ups*

- According to the St Petersburg USA Orphanage Intervention Research Project[^5], other moderating factors include
	- Severity of deprivation
	- Age at assessment 
	- Gender
		- However, according to a paper on the IQ of children growing up in CCIs[^6], Gender did not appear to be a significant moderator; whether the studies included only males or only females did not yield different effect sizes 
	- Nutritional status
	- Home environment
	- Physical Health
	- Disease burden
	

# Typical Developmental Milestones
- According to the Institute for Human Services and the Ohio Child Welfare Training Program[^4], these charts can be used to assess child's milestone achievement and delays. 

## School-aged children

![[School Aged (Physical, Cognitive, Social).png]]


### Warning Signs 
According to Hope Worldwide[^14], here are a few concerns of not meeting these needs at this age
- Where the child does not accomplish the tasks, he may give up hope for the future
- The child might feel inferior (less than his/her peers)
- The child may feel inadequate (not knowing, not being able)

### How active should a 6- to 12-year-old be?
Physical activity guidelines for school-age kids recommend that they get **at least 1 hour** of moderate to strong physical activity daily. In addition:
- Most of the physical activity should be aerobic, where kids use large muscles and continue for a period of time.
- Examples of aerobic activity are running, swimming, and dancing.
- School-age kids usually have brief bouts of moderate to strong physical activity alternating with light activity or rest throughout the day. Any moderate to strong activity counts toward the 60-minute goal.
- Muscle-strengthening and bone-strengthening physical activity should be included at least 3 days a week.
- Children naturally build strong muscles and bones when they run, jump and play. Formal weight programs aren’t needed. However, they are safe when properly designed and supervised.

### Role of caregiver
- According to Hope Worldwide[^14], here are a few practices to support children at this age, 
	- Praise the child’s efforts
	- Encourage the child to see himself/herself as equal to the peers
	- Encourage a sense of being able to achieve even against all problems
	- Teach them how to handle failure and solve problems
	- Caregiver must give appropriate support
- According to the American Psychological Association, these are the tips for caregivers
	- Help your children to develop a sense of competence: give them opportunities to master some skills like cooking, building models, making crafts, playing an instrument.
	- Reinforce the understanding of right and wrong and consequences.
	- Teach problem solving to your child. **Use the IDEAL model** to:
		- Identify the problem and the feelings involved (Your child is being bullied and is afraid of going to school)
		- Determine with the child possible solutions without use of violence.
		- Evaluate with the child the merits of each possible solution.
		- Act, choosing the best solution.
		- Learn from what you and your child did to solve the problem.
		- Use real-life situations (in your family or make-up a situation) and when you are on the bus, in the car or in the kitchen, play the IDEAL game with your child. A mock scenario could be: A child can’t watch TV because he or she hasn’t done homework and she/he is mad and breaks the remote control.
	- Reinforce prosocial skills such as sharing, empathy, cooperation by asking a child to do things like help care for a baby, collect food for a shelter.
	- Provide opportunities for your child to develop an understanding of rules by playing simple table games that rely on chance rather than on skills such as cards, dominoes, tic-tac-toe.
	- Teach by speaking out loud to yourself (so your child will hear) about a problem and how to resolve it. An example: We are out of milk, bread and fruit. I’m not feeling well. I will call daddy and ask him to stop by the grocery store on his way home to get them.
	- Demonstrate that behaviors and actions have consequences for everybody involved in a situation: If you do that, this will happen or when you do this, then you will get this


## Adolescents

![[Adoloscents (Physical, Cognitive, Social).png]]

![[Adolescents (Emotional).png]]



### Factors associated with resilience and positive outcomes in adolescents

According to child-parenting guidelines in the US, these are the factors that influence outcomes for young adults

#### Stable, positive relationship with at least one caring adult
 Numerous studies have found that the presence of an adult—a parent or someone other than a parent—with a strong positive, emotional attachment to the child is associated with resilience (Garbarino, 1999). This might be a teacher or coach, an extended family member, or a mentor, such as those found in the Big Brothers/Big Sisters Program (Roth & Brooks-Gunn, 2000).

#### Religious and spiritual anchors
A sense of meaning is one of the major pathways through which violent youth find their way to a constructive future, with religious and spiritual institutions and practices being important vehicles for developing a sense of meaning for these youth (Garbarino, 1999).

#### High, realistic academic expectations and adequate support  
Schools that provide students with a sense of shared cooperative responsibility and belonging, convey high expectations for participation, and provide high levels of individual support for students tend to enhance resilience (Siedman et al., in press).

#### Positive home environment
A warm, nurturing parenting style, with both clear limit setting and respect for the growing autonomy of adolescents, appears to be associated with resilience in adolescents 

#### Emotional intelligence and ability to cope with stress  
Although intelligence per se has been reported to be associated with resilience (Fergusson & Lynskey, 1996), the factors that may be more important, because they are more amenable to change and are also involved in resilience, are emotional intelligence and the ability to cope with stress (Garbarino, 1999).


## Role of the caregiver: 
According to Hope Worldwide[^14], here are a few practices to support children at this age, 
- Keep open communication channels
- Encourage the child to speak their mind or express their opinions
- Provide advice and guidance
- Set boundaries with child
- Give the child the opportunity to express his/her anger and other difficult feelings
- Include them in discussions about a variety of topics, issues, and current events.
- Encourage your teen to think independently and develop their own ideas.
- Help your child in setting goals.
- Challenge them to think about possibilities for the future.
- Compliment and praise your teen for well-thought-out decisions.
- Help them in reevaluating poorly made decisions.
- One important way to improve cognitive development for your kids is to regularly expose them to new environments. Don't just stick to your regular routine. Schedule field trips to new places in town, like museums, parks, zoos, aquariums, playgrounds, and more.
- Music is a great tool for helping promote the development of many important cognitive skills. Music as well as memory and word identification, sensory perception, and more.



# Assessment tools [[Assessment Tools]]
- According to a paper that looked at IQ of children growing up in CCIs, 
	- A list of such tests of IQ measurements are:
        * Raven's Matrices
        * WISC
        * Hetzer-Bühler
        * Griffiths
        * Gesell Schedules
        * Bayley Scales
        * Cattell test
        * SON
        * Stanford-Binet
        * Uzgiris-Hunt
        * Gesell/Kuhlmann Merrill-Palmer
        * Denver II test
        * Battelle
        * Minnesota
* According to a paper on assessing quality of care homes[^9], we learn about the 
	    * Family Day Care Rating Scale (FDCRS) and Infant/Toddler Environment Rating Scale (ITERS) by Harms and Clifford (1984), 
	    * the PROFILE by Abbott-Shim and Sibley (1993), the Caregiver Interaction Scale by Arnett (1989), 
	    * the Adult Involvement Scale (AIS) by Howes and Stewart (1987), and the
	    * Observational Record of the Caregiving Environment (ORCE) developed by the NICHD Early Child Care Research Network (1996) are some of the tools in use.
		    * All these tools follow a top-down approach and have a pre-defined rubric that allows to score the child care homes.
- According to a paper that studied the needs of children in institutional care, these are the folowing assessment tools used:
	- To measure sociodemographic characteristics of the children, details from the Health and Human Services Agency's data information system was obtained. It consisted of age, gender, primary language, race/ethnicity, reason for removal, and initial placement type. Seven categories were used to describe reason for removal:
		  - sexual abuse,
		  - physical abuse,
		  - emotional abuse,
		  - child neglect,
		  - caregiver absence,
		  - change of placement,
		  - other, including exploitation (e.g., using a child to beg for money) and out-of-town inquiries (e.g., a child from Mexico living in the San Diego area needing child welfare services).
	- Medical Charts at Polinsky:The physical health and mental health status data were abstracted from these charts.
		- **Physical health** : The body systems section of the medical record grouped potential health problems under the following proscribed categories: dermatologic, respiratory, digestive, ear, eye, endocrine, musculoskeletal, neurological, mental health, cardiac, hematologic, reproductive, urinary, toxic syndromes, in utero exposure, toxic screen results, nonaccidental trauma, birth history, metabolic/ nourishment, systemic infections
	  - **Mental health** : Seven types of mental health disturbances were specified on the standardized intake form in the chart: attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism/ pervasive developmental disorder, depression, oppositional defiant disorder, adjustment disorder, disruptive disorder, and others
-  Denver Developmental Screening Test II (Denver II):
The Denver-II was used to screen all children entering Polinsky for developmental delay. This tool can be used to screen children from birth to 6 years of age and includes 125 items in four sections: Personal-Social, Language, Fine Motor-Adaptive, and Gross Motor. It was used by the DSEP program for three reasons.
- Bayley Scales of Infant Development II (Bayley-II):
The Bayley-II36 was used to evaluate children ages 0 to 42 months on three scales of development: mental, motor, and behavior.
- Stanford-Binet IV (SB-IV):The SB-IV was developed to evaluate cognitive development for ages 2 years through adulthood and measures four areas: verbal reasoning, abstract/visual reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and short-term memory.

# Defining Play
- According a paper on the importance of play in health, play is described using a biological perspective
	- not fully functional in the context in which it appears
	- spontaneous, pleasurable, rewarding, and voluntary
	- different from other more serious behaviours in form (e.g. exaggerated) or timing (e.g. occurring early in life before the more serious version is needed)
	- repeated, but not in unvarying stereotypic form (e.g. rocking or pacing) 
	- initiated in the absence of severe stress 

# Why Play? 
- A review paper on the importance of play in the development of child health[^2], discusses that:
	- An evolutionary perspective dictates that play must serve an important purpose considering the costs it entails in terms of time, energy and risk of injury and predation 
	- From a developmental perspective, play allows children to experiment with their behavioural and social repertoire, and to practice their physical and communication skills
	- Play facilitates the development of social competence, emotional capacities and resilience, creativity and problem-solving skills
- According to a paper that studied play in relation to cognition outcomes[^3], 
	- Play has been related to the development of both cognition and social competence (Fisher, 1992). The findings indicate that the relationship between cognition and play is relatively robust.
- According to a paper on the importance of play in promoting healthy caregiver relationships, 
	- Play is essential in developing social and emotional ties.
	- It allows parents to “listen” in a very different, but productive, way. When parents observe their children playing or join them in child-driven play, they can view the world through their child’s eyes and, therefore, may learn to communicate or offer guidance more effectively.
	- Play also helps forge connections between children. It allows them to learn how to share, to negotiate and resolve conflicts, and to learn self-advocacy skills when necessary.

## Play & Child Development 
- According to a paper that studied the interplay of play and cognition[^3], 
	- Play behaviours do not precisely mirror cognitive or other developmental processes, but play is an impetus for development.
	- Studies describing play and its relationship to development have demonstrated associations with cognition, motor skills, language, sensory processing, socialization, affect, and disposition
	- Children progress through a succession of simple to more complex play stages associated with cognition.
	- The strong correlation between cognition and play parallels other studies of children with developmental disabilities. In these studies, children with cognitive delays progressed more slowly than typical peers in their achievement on standardized assessments of cognition; however, the correlation between cognition and play was moderate to high
- According to a paper that discusses the importance of play in development[^5], 
	- The playful interactions with caregivers give the child plenty of opportunities to hear the language and motivate them to speak.
	- As the child grows older, they play with other children and learn to share, follow the rules of the game and wait for their turn to play. Thus they begin to learn to take into consideration another person's point of view.

## Play & Child Emotional Expression
In a paper that discusses the effect of play on child health development[^2], we look at how play forms children's identity
- Erikson (1977) proposed that play allows children to experiment with a wide range of experiences, and simulates their potential real-life consequences
- Piaget (1962) theorized that make-believe play provides children with opportunities to reproduce real-life conflicts, to work out ideal resolutions for their own pleasure, and to ameliorate negative feelings
	- Narratives and story-telling can support children in integrating a broad variety of positive and negative life experiences
	- In adolescence, co-constructed narratives have been linked to the development of identity, which is considered a key-element for mental health 
	- Play may also allow for the expression of frustration and rage, allowing the child (or adult) to cope with environmental challenges, thereby contributing to mental health 
	- play allows children to experiment and explore, and playful activities provide a secure setting for testing the consequences of many alternative scenarios, in order to develop a rich and flexible behavioural, social and emotional repertoire

## Play & Learning 
- According to a paper that discusses the importance of play in development[^5], 
	- In Infancy Thought Develops Through Activity:  As an infant the only way the child can learn is by doing an activity and finding out for themself. In the early years learning of social, cognitive, language and motor skills is possible only through play.
	- Children Learn by Doing: Instead of being allowed to do an activity, if the child was merely told about the concept, it would not be so clear to them. 
	- Play Holds the Child's Attention: Play involves the children physically and holds their attention in one activity for longer periods and, therefore, aids learning. 
	- Learning Through Play is Fun: It is only fair that we help children learn through ways they enjoy and make learning a stimulating and rewarding experience for them. Play, therefore, is an enjoyable medium through which children learn things they are ready to learn.

# Types of Play 
### (Skim, details not as relevant- read conclusions for each type of play)

This section primarily relies on a white-paper that captures the value of play in child development. [^1]

## Summary of this section (for ease of reading)

* When and how is play more effective than other contexts for learning? As outlined in the previous sections, there is evidence, among other things, that:
	* physical play is linked to motor development, and some tentative evidence that it is linked to social development;
	* unstructured breaks from cognitive tasks improve learning and attention, though it is unclear whether play leads to greater improvements in learning than simply taking a break and, for example, talking with friends; 
	* block play leads to improvements in spatial processing/mental rotation; 
	* construction play relates to language development, and this relationship may be strongest in infancy, with pretend play becoming more important for language as children enter toddlerhood; 
	* word-play and word-games relate to language development; 
	* pretend play relates to language development, and particularly narrative skills; • pretend play – and particularly fantasy-oriented pretence – may relate to learning-to-learn skills such as executive function and self-regulation. 
	* board games (particularly those with numbers and linear number sequences) lead to improvements in numeracy/mathematics ability; 
	* physical games with rules help children (and especially boys) adapt to formal schooling 

## **Physical play**

### Elements of Physical Play

According to a white paper on the role of play in children's development[^1], 
* In children it includes activity play (e.g. jumping, climbing, dancing, skipping, bike riding and ball play), fine-motor practice (e.g. sewing, colouring, cutting, junk modelling and manipulating action toys and construction toys) and what is usually referred to as ‘rough-and-tumble’ (play fighting with friends, siblings or caregivers). 

### Impact of Physical Play

* In a more recent review, Brussoni et al. (2015) concluded that ‘the evidence suggests overall positive effects of risky outdoor play on a variety of health indicators and behaviours in children aged 3-12 years. However, they pointed out that these conclusions were based on ‘very low’ to ‘moderate’ quality evidence
* Becker et al. (2014) used accelerometers to assess preschool children’s level of physical activity and found a medium level correlation (0.46) with **cognitive self-regulation**, measured using the Head-Toes-Knees-Shoulders Task (HTKS) test. 
* There was also a significant indirect effect of active play on maths and literacy scores via the HTKS test, leading to the conclusion that self-regulation mediates a relationship between active play and school achievement. 
* In regards to **rough-and-tumble play**, Bjorklund & Brown (1998) suggested that it facilitates development of social cognition through the coding and decoding of social cues or signals.
* In one study, for example, moderate to large positive correlations, for popular children and for boys (but not for rejected children and girls), were found between rough-and-tumble play and higher interpersonal cognitive problem solving scores.
* Colwell & Lindsey (2005) also found these kinds of differential relationships according to gender. They reported that, for boys (but not girls), same-sex rough-and-tumble play was associated with same-sex peer acceptance and teachers’ ratings of social competence. **Interestingly, however, boys’ rough-and-tumble play with mixed-sex peers was negatively associated with peer acceptance and teachers’ ratings of social competence.**
* Physical play such as running, skipping and riding a bicycle helps children develop:
	* good physical fitness
	* agility
	* stamina
	* co-ordination
	* balance

### Physical Play during school recess is not necessary
* Thus, in their review of this area, Pellegrini & Bohn (2005) conclude that ‘unstructured breaks from demanding cognitive tasks seem to facilitate school learning, as well as more general social competence and adjustment to school.
*  In a study of 5-9-year-olds’ playground behaviour, Pellegrini, Huberty & Jones (1995) found that children’s attentiveness improved after recess, **but physical activity did not seem to play an important role in this, as recess with limited opportunity for physical activity was found to have the same effect.** 
* Similarly, in a year-long study of playground games with rules (ball games, chase, and jumping or singing games) during 5-6-year-old children’s first year in school, they concluded that it was the social interaction with peers during recess that was linked to school success, in terms of academic outcomes. 


### Conclusions about Physical Play
* The evidence base for conclusions on physical play is not extensive. 
* There is good evidence that physically active play provides **children with exercise and the consequent health benefits**
* there seems to be reasonable evidence associating physical play of various kinds with academic progress and cognitive self-regulation, and with social competence; 
	* • there is some evidence that, for boys, rough-and-tumble play supports the development of their social competence and emotional awareness and has possible indirect effects on academic progress; 
* there is evidence that unstructured breaks from cognitive tasks improve learning and attention, though it is unclear whether physical play contributes to this effect beyond simply taking a break and, for example, talking with friends.



## **Play with objects**
* This second type of play, which is also widely observed in primates, concerns children’s developing explorations of the world and the objects they find within it.
* Play with objects begins as soon as infants can grasp and hold on to them; early investigative behaviours include mouthing/biting, rotating while looking, rubbing/stroking, hitting and dropping.
* From around 18-24 months, toddlers begin to arrange objects, which gradually develops into sorting and classifying activities. By the age of 4 years, building, making and constructing behaviours emerge
* First, it is in play with objects that it is claimed that young children start to develop their representational abilities. 
* Second, Vygotsky also argued that play of this type is particularly related to the development of thinking, reasoning and problem-solving strategies.


### Object play and problem-solving
* In a study with 4-year-olds, for example, Smith & Dutton (1979) reported data showing that for some types of problem-solving, play experience and instruction can be equally effective, but for more challenging problems requiring creative and innovative approaches, play with objects appeared to be superior as a learning context, compared to instructional approaches.


### Object play and language
* Ungerer & Sigman (1984), for example, carried out an observational longitudinal study of play with toys with infants aged 13.5 and 22 months. At the younger age, playing with objects in a conventional, functional way predicted language scores at 22 months, but at 22 months only pretend play with objects related to language. 
* An earlier observational study by Pellegrini (1980) with 5 to 6-year-olds also showed a similar pattern, with the amount of construction play children engaged in being significantly correlated with their pre-reading, language and writing abilities, but not as strongly as their pretend play.
* The results in both studies showed that the children wrote with greater engagement and enthusiasm, and higher levels of creativity, after play with objects experiences (in which there was also, however, a clear pretence element) than when they did not have this opportunity. 


### Play with objects, math and spatial abilities
* Nath & Szücs (2014), in a study with 7-year olds, have also recently reported a positive relationship between abilities on a LEGO construction task and children’s mathematics performance (although, as this is a correlation, no causal relationship can be imputed)


### Conclusions about object play
* theoretical arguments have been developed, and have been supported by some empirical studies, linking play with objects with the development of representational abilities, reasoning and problem-solving strategies; 
* a range of studies have provided reasonable evidence of links between play with objects with the development of language, maths and spatial skills; 
* It is also the case that, overwhelmingly, studies of play with objects have been with young children under the age of 7 years.


## **Symbolic play**
* We now come to types of play which are engaged in only by humans, mainly because they rely on our incomparable symbolic representational abilities. 
* The first of the types, which we are referring to as symbolic play, concerns play with the various symbolic representational systems we use to make and communicate meaning. For this reason, an alternative name for this type of play might be ‘semiotic’ play. 
* This type of play emerges in children from around the age of 12 months when they first begin to intentionally use sounds to convey meaning (although it could be argued that they play with sounds, in babbling, much earlier and also with gestures, which are used to convey meaning during the first year of life) 


### Symbolic play and language
* We begin with play with language and its impact on early literacy, as this is the most researched area and the only one which has merited a significant review, namely that by Christie & Roskos (2006) 
* They cite, for example:
	* evidence that infants and toddlers frequently play with the sounds of language, including repeating strings of words containing related sounds, exploring both rhyme and alliteration (Weir, 1976, pp. 610-611)
	* findings that children’s knowledge of nursery rhymes and the frequency that they engage in word play were both strong predictors of children’s phonological awareness (Fernandez Fein & Baker, 1997). 
* • the many research-based strategies for promoting phonological awareness in preschool and kindergarten use playful activities such as singing songs, reciting nursery rhymes, reading books that play with the sounds of language, and game-like activities (
* In a very recent study, they have also reported a qualitative analysis to show that 9-11-year old children play with language in writing as well as in speech. Three empirical studies have been carried out, however, that do appear to provide evidence to support a link specifically between language play and literacy development more generally.

#### Musical play
* In relation to musical play, for example, it is a common observation that children sing, dance and delight in exploring and making sounds of all kinds, with their own bodies and with all kinds of objects. 
* Trevarthen (see Malloch & Trevarthen, 2009), for example, has demonstrated the ‘musicality’ of early infant-mother interactions and argued for the importance of the infant’s innate response to rhythm and sounds in establishing early communicative abilities. 
* Kirschner & Tomasello (2010) showed that the prosocial behaviour (helping each other and co-operating) of a group of 5-6-year old children who took part in a musical play activity improved to a significantly greater extent than that of a group who took part in non-musical play. 
* More recently, Zachariou & Whitebread (2015) have shown in an observational study of 6-year-old children that engagement in musical play allowed self regulatory behaviours to emerge. However, it is not clearly established that the musical play activities, as such, promoted self-regulation, or merely allowed the children to use abilities they already possessed.

#### Play drawing and writing
* The final aspect of symbolic or semiotic play to be significantly theorised and researched concerns children’s drawing. Like language and musical play, play with mark-making and drawing is ubiquitous in the behaviour of children across cultures, and is widely accepted as an important way in which children, even before they are literate, record their experiences and express their ideas.
* Vygotsky (1986) himself pointed out the very close links between early drawing and writing which is very commonly observed in young children’s mark-making.
* It is clerar importance of continuous provision for playful drawing in early years educational settings. 


### Conclusions about symbolic play
* it seems reasonable to hypothesise that play with symbolic systems will help develop those systems; however, this is a relatively neglected and weak area of play research as regards the impact of play on children’s development; 
* there is reasonably good evidence that language play enhances children’s language development in a variety of ways; this is important, as there is reasonably good evidence that language development has relations with other important skills and outcomes, including self-regulation (Vallatton & Ayoub, 2011) and school achievement (Hoff, E, 2013);
* there is some evidence that musical play might be significant in relation to the development of communication skills, and there is some evidence that it is related to higher cognitive functioning, and can be used for self-regulation (Winsler, Ducenne & Koury, 2011).


## **Pretend play**
* Pretend play is the type of play which has been researched most extensively. In a recent review paper, Lillard, Lerner, Hopkins, Dore, Smith & Palmquist (2013) identified and critiqued 154 studies of pretend play relations with children’s learning and development in various areas. The authors conclude that: 
	* pretend play is one way of developing children’s reasoning skills, but there are other ways of achieving the same result that are just as effective;
	* pretend play may be a way of developing children’s social skills and awareness of others’ minds (‘Theory of Mind’) but the evidence is mixed or unsatisfactory;
	* pretend play could be crucial to the development of language, narrative skills and emotion regulation, but the evidence is very limited and more research is needed;
	* There is little to no evidence that pretend play helps to develop children’s creativity, intelligence, problem-solving, or self-regulation and executive functioning.


### Learning in pretence and real contexts 
* One study, investigating children’s ability to learn new information in pretence and real contexts, and directly addressing some of the methodological concerns expressed by Lillard et al., has been published by some of the authors involved in this original review (Hopkins, Dore & Lillard, 2015). 
* Intriguingly, when subsequently presented with a set of three objects, including the original objects and two others, children in the pretend condition were more likely to extend the pretend label to novel objects similar in appearance to the substitute used during the pretence episode, but children in the real condition were more likely to apply the pretend label only to the identical object used during the learning episode.


### Pretend play and creativity
* We found three studies that addressed the relation between pretend play and creativity.
	* As a measure of creativity, children were asked to provide endings to stories and to make drawings, both of which were rated for creativity by the experimenters. Children who engaged in more elaborate role play – particularly involving imaginary friends and pretend identities – scored significantly higher for creativity in their narratives. 
	* Wallace and Russ (2015) looked at how pretend play predicted the creativity of 31 privately educated girls over a four-year period, from when the girls were between 5 and 10 years old to when they were between 9 and 14 years old. Pretend play was assessed using the Affect in Play Scale, and creativity was measured with the Alternative Uses Task, where children are asked to think of different uses for common objects such as a key or a shoe. Children who were more imaginative and organised in their pretend play at the start of the study scored higher on the Alternative Uses Task four years later. 
	* Both of the above studies suggest that pretend play and creativity are related, but they do not provide any evidence that pretence causes increases in children’s creativity.
* The only study found in this area to take a more experimental approach is that by Hoffmann and Russ (2016), who conducted an intervention study with a sample of 50 5 to 8-year-old girls.
	* For children in the intervention group, the level of organisation and imagination in pretend play (measured using the Affect in Play Scale) improved substantially over the course of the study compared to the control group. However, there were no significant improvements in either creativity measure in the intervention group compared to the control group
	* This is tentative evidence that pretend play might lead to improvements in creativity for children (or at least girls) who are less advanced in their play skills than their peers, but the fact that the result is based on a sub-sample and only one outcome measure out of two means it should be treated with caution. 


### Pretence and executive functions
* They found correlations between specific types of fantasy orientation and specific executive function measures. Thus, while children’s fantasy-related thoughts correlated with their ability to shift attention and their beliefs in fantastical entities or imaginary friends correlated with their inhibitory control, children who reported more favourite fantasy-related toys and games had lower scores for inhibitory control and working memory.
* Children’s reported proclivity to pretend to be someone or something other than themselves also did not correlate with any executive function measures. 
* Results showed that children in the fantastical play group increased in their working memory scores over the course of the intervention, whereas children in the other two groups did not. Furthermore, the children who were most fantastical and highly engaged in the play were the ones who showed most improvement. 
* These results add to earlier research by Singer (1961) and the study mentioned earlier by Manuilenko (1975), both discussed by Lillard et al., suggesting that pretence may be a strategy that children can apply to improve performance on certain executive function tasks. It could also be the case that whether such strategies are effective (and perhaps which are effective) changes with the age of the child.
* There is now evidence of a potential causal relationship between fantasy-oriented pretence and working memory development, and further indication that pretence may be a strategy that can be applied in executive function tasks.


### Pretend play and language
* Conner, Kelly-Vance, Ryalls & Friehe (2014) reported the one study we found relating pretend play to language development. 
* This involved 10 2 year olds with whom they developed an intervention which included components of reading, modeling, and positive reinforcement of language and play.
* All the children were assessed using the Play in Early Childhood Evaluation System, the Preschool Language Scale and a Vocabulary Assessment. The results showed that children who received the intervention increased pretend play, comprehension and expressive communication skills more than the comparison group.
* This study’s main contribution is to suggest that pretend play interventions are feasible with, and may have an impact upon, children as young as 2 years of age.


### Pretence and emotion regulation
* Gilpin, Brown and Pierucci (2015) measured the emotion regulation skills and fantasy orientation of 103 5-year old children using checklists and questionnaires, and found that the two measures were correlated. This finding slightly expands the previous correlational finding of Shields and Cicchetti (1997), discussed by Lillard et al., in that it shows that there is a specific correlation with fantasy orientation in addition to pretence behaviour in general.


### Pretence and social development
* In one very recent study in Hong Kong, Fung & Cheng (2017) have reported evidence related to pretend play and social development.
* Children’s pre- and post-training social competences were assessed, using the Peer Interactive Play Rating Scales, by two assistant teachers who did not take part in the play training. Results revealed a trend that girls who participated in the pretend play training tended to be less disruptive during peer interactions after the training than those who participated in non-pretend play, while boys benefited equally from the two play activities.
* Qu, Shen, Chee & Chen, (2015) conducted the one study we found relating to Theory of Mind (ToM).  The results showed that socio-dramatic play positively predicted children’s gains in ToM, and that teachers’ ToM-related guidance during socio-dramatic play and children’s pretest executive functioning positively predicted this effect of socio-dramatic play on children’s ToM. 


### Pretence and motivation
* Finally, Sawyer (2017) investigated the impact of pretence on motivation. During the activity, the children in the pretend play condition demonstrated more types of self-directed speech associated with higher persistence on-task. These results indicate that framing an activity as pretence may increase children’s motivation.


### Conclusions about Pretend Play
* Pretend play is one way of developing children’s reasoning skills, but there are other ways of achieving the same result that are just as effective; 
* Pretend play may be a way of developing children’s social skills and awareness of others’ minds (‘Theory of mind’). Most of the evidence is mixed or unsatisfactory, but there is good evidence from one recent study that pretend play may have an impact on social development; 
* Pretend play could be crucial to the development of language, narrative skills and emotion regulation, but the evidence is very limited and more research is needed; • there are differences in the quality of learning and applications of learning when children learn in pretence versus non-pretence contexts; 
* There is some good new evidence that pretend play – and particularly fantasy oriented pretence – may relate to learning-to-learn skills such as executive function and self-regulation;
* There is very tentative evidence for a link between pretence and motivation.


## **Games with rules**
* Young children are strongly motivated by the need to make sense of their world and, as part of this, they are very interested in rules.
*  From a very young age children begin to enjoy games with rules, and to invent their own. These include physical games such as chasing games, hide-and-seek, throwing and catching etc.
* As children mature, electronic and computer games, and the whole variety of sporting activities emerge.
* As well as helping children to develop their understandings about rules, the main developmental contribution of playing games derives from their essentially social nature. While playing games with their friends, siblings and parents, it has been argued that young children are learning a range of social skills related to sharing, taking turns, understanding others’ perspectives and so on.
* The most frequently occurring outcome reported for games for learning was knowledge acquisition, while entertainment games addressed a broader range of affective, behaviour change, perceptual and cognitive and physiological outcomes.
* Future research on digital games would benefit from a systematic programme of experimental work, examining in detail which game features are most effective in promoting engagement and supporting learning.


### Games and socio-cultural development
* Two other largely theoretical papers are worth mentioning. Oren (2008) outlines the way board games can be used in child psychotherapy and gives examples of how they facilitate children’s shifting perspectives as part of the therapeutic process. 
* Hromek & Roffey (2009), similarly, discuss the use of games during “circle time” in social and emotional learning approaches in schools.


### Board games and numbers
* There is evidence that board games involving numbers appear to help children’s number-based skills, and may lead to children having a greater interest in mathematics, perhaps because they have experienced it and its applications in a fun, relaxed context


### Playground games and social skills
* In the first category, Pellegrini, Kato, Blatchford & Baines (2002), observed 77 6-7-year-old children’s playground games for one school year in two inner-city schools. They concluded that facility with games (ball games, chase, and jumping or singing games), particularly for boys, was related to social competence with their peers and adjustment to very early schooling (as assessed by self-report and teacher ratings).
* This suggests that games with a strong social element – such as most playground games – could help children develop their social networks and a sense of belonging in the school environment.
* In a second study in this area, however, Lehrer, Petrakos & Venkatesh (2014) investigated whether time spent in unstructured play outside of school predicted 6-7-year-old children’s creativity, cognitive, social, or emotional outcomes in school, but largely produced negative results. In particular, as regards games with rules, they found no significant correlations between the amount of time children spent engaged in ‘board games and puzzles’ and any of their outcome measures.


### Games and spatial skills
* Newman, Hansen & Gutierrez (2016), on the other hand, in a study with 8-year olds, investigated the effects of playing two different games (Block building or Scrabble) on spatial ability, with pre and post-tests involving a computerised mental rotation test with reaction time as the outcome measure, and fMRI scans. Not surprisingly, only the block play group showed significant training effects on the mental rotation test and increased activation in brain regions associated with spatial processing. However, what this tells us about the specific effects of playing games with rules is not clear. 


### Games: an untapped field of study
* The key theoretical point about games with rules, that their essentially social nature supports children’s social and moral development, has been supported, for boys at least, by one study. As regards intellectual benefits, there are 3 or 4 studies supporting some gains, over a short period of time, for aspects of numeracy. 
* Clearly the study of games with rules, particularly those not involving a computer, is very much in its infancy. At the moment the field is enjoying something of a resurgence due to the popularity of computer games, but there are no studies, as far as we are aware, of the differential effects of playing the same games on or off-screen. A vast range of un-addressed and un-answered questions therefore remain. 
* The problem-solving element in some games, with the inevitably iterative patterns of behaviour therefore induced, might support the development of mental strategy development and metacognitive review, which in turn enhances creative thinking.


### Conclusions about Games with Rules 
* board games (particularly those with numbers and linear number sequences) lead to improvements in numeracy/mathematics ability; 
* physical games with rules help children (and especially boys) adapt to formal schooling;
* games with rules may act as a proxy for an adult scaffolding and guiding children’s learning, while also giving the child freedom and choice in their activity.



# Play in the context of Learning

## Joyful and actively engaging
* Children who perceive an activity as play are more focused, attentive, motivated and show signs of higher well-being while on-task (Howard & McInnes, 2013; Sawyer, 2017)
* This suggests that perceiving an activity as play creates active engagement and joy, which leads to children being in the appropriate cognitive and emotional state to remain on-task and process information. 
* But in addition to this, various studies show how social interaction, meaning and iteration can also be important factors in children’s learning


## Socially interactive
* Lehrer at al. (2014) assessed whether the activities children engaged in during their unstructured time predicted their ‘adaptive skills’ (as measured on the teacher-report BASC-2 measure)
* Similarly, Pellegrini (1992) found that 5-year-old children’s level of social interaction with other children during recess predicted their school achievement, whereas their level of social interaction with teachers during recess was negatively related to their school achievement
* Playing with other children, watching them and learning from them, may be one of the ways in which playful learning exerts its effect.
* However, children can also learn from adults in playful contexts. 
* It would therefore be behavioural problems and difficulties adapting to school that were negatively related to school achievement, rather than interactions with teachers causing a reduction in children’s school achievement 
* These results demonstrate that playful interaction with a knowledgeable adult can be a more effective context for learning than traditional teaching approaches such as completing problems in an exercise book. We can see that learning from others – both adults and children – through social interaction explains some of the ways in which playful learning can be superior to other learning approaches. 
* Furthermore, it seems possible that playing with others could also be detrimental to learning in some situations – for example if the play partner passes on false information or a deficient strategy.


## Meaningful
* The children who simply played the number board game became more interested in mathematics, and one explanation for this result is that numbers now had more meaning for them – they had found a new context in their lives in which numbers could be applied, and that context was fun!
* Dansky (1980) found that sociodramatic play led to children developing higher narrative skills than other conditions with equal adult contact, showing that social interactions with a more knowledgeable partner is not the important factor in this case. Baumer, Ferholt & Lecusay (2005) compared how pretending versus story talk influenced narrative development, and pretending led to superior outcomes.
* When pretending, a child needs to draw on their own personal experience and interests in order to generate ideas for characters and situations. Discussing a story, by contrast, can remain a relatively abstract, detached activity. 


### Iterative
* Therefore, these studies of object play demonstrate how the iterative nature of play can make it a more effective learning context for innovative problem-solving. Variation is key
* It was concluded that cooperative problem-solving activities that allow children greater control of the task goals and interaction, similar to play contexts, appear to promote higher levels of cooperation and more effective learning and performance in young children. 
* In sum, certain studies from the existing body of research into play types and child outcomes support the hypothesis that the five characteristics of playful experiences are the main factors that facilitate learning through play. However, more research is needed to confirm this hypothesis. 
* Finally, although there is some suggestive evidence about the role of play in supporting the development of communication skills, of abstract thought, self regulation,and more adaptive, flexible, creative thinking, we still do not have conclusive evidence of causal relations.


## **What we know about play and learning outcomes:**
* Perceiving an activity as the play seems to lead to higher levels of joy and active Engagement
* Social interaction during play is sometimes linked to improved learning outcomes.
* Pretending may lead to improved outcomes because children make more meaningful links to their own knowledge and experience.
* Iterative play may lead to more creative, innovative ways of thinking and problem solving.


## **What we don’t know about play and learning outcomes:**
* What is the relative contribution of joy and active engagement to learning through play? Are they both required for learning to occur?
* What is it about social interaction that can improve learning outcomes? Is it the knowledge transmitted by the play partner, increases in confidence and communication skills, or something else?
* Does pretence make children create meaningful links to their own experience, compared to other learning contexts and other types of play?
* How much effect does meaning have on learning during play? Is there a large or small difference in learning if children can link material to their own experience?
* Under what conditions, if any, are the characteristics detrimental to learning? Particularly for social interaction, it seems logical that playing with an ignorant or misguided partner could lead to reduced or maladaptive learning.



# Play in Institutional Care

## Factors that affect play in low-resource settings
- In a paper that describes the importance of play in promoting healthy caregiving relationships[^4], we explore what makes play difficult for children in low-resource communities. 
	- Access to recess and other in-school creative and physical outlets (eg, physical education, art, music), as well as after-school youth development programs are reduced. 
	* Second, out-of-school opportunities for play may be compromised by a lack of safe play areas, because parks and playgrounds are less abundant in lower-income areas and, in some cases, may be unsafe because of drug dealing, violence, and vandalism. 
	* Because lower-income parents have to deal with additional social, emotional, and economic stressors of daily living, they may have less time, energy, and resources available to provide active and creative playtime at the park, playground, or even in the home.
	* Schools, under pressure to increase academic performance and to decrease the achievement gap of students, have increased direct educational time, including after-school enrichment and tutorial programs, versus play time

## Current needs of play for children in care
- These needs are based on a study on physical activty in residential care homes in Ireland[^10]
	- Previous research has suggested that many children in residential care settings often do not have access to extra-curricular learning and activity opportunities which could help deal with their physical, social and emotional needs
	- Research conducted directly with children in care has indicated the significant value they place on relationships with care staff and peers, whilst highlighting the difficulty they can experience in developing these connections and relationships
	- There was a further belief that due to previous experiences and life events these children may be more susceptible to influence by others, but not to be influenced by the adults around them as easily as their peers.
	- Engagement in physical activity (PA) has consistently been found to be associated with positive outcomes for young people (YP), including improved physical, mental and emotional well- being
	- There is significant evidence of the positive impact of participation in PA on psychological well being of children 
	- Previous research has highlighted the potential of engagement in activities for providing consistency and a sense of stability for YP who have experienced significant changes in their lives 

## Assessing play behaviour in institutional care
- [^3]In a paper that studied play and congition correlation in institutional children, they discussed previous evidence that shows that
	* In a classic field study of child development in orphanages, Provence and Lipton (1962) described infants reaching for and grasping toys until 5 or 6 months of age, but from that point on their exploration dwindled and continued to do so with further institutionalization.
	* Children cared for in institutions exhibited less exploratory play, less varied play, and developmentally lower levels of play than their home-reared peers. (These findings must, however, be interpreted conservatively).
	* Kaler and Freeman (1994) conducted a play test on Romanian children. The authors described the children’s play behaviours as “... quite low for the sample’s chronological age but appropriate for the mental age”
	* British-born adoptees exhibited significantly higher levels of pretend play, roleplay and referencing of others’ mental states than the Romanian adoptees, suggesting that the effects of institutionalization may be long-lasting. 
* In the same paper, in a study conducted by authors, they noted that 
	* when compared to children with the same chronological age in McCune’s sample, fewer children from the sample demonstrated play behaviours at each level of play with the exception of symbolic play
	* This finding paralleled Kreppner and colleagues’ (1999) findings that play behaviours of children previously institutionalized were rated lower than those of a comparison group. 
	* In addition to underlying cognitive abilities, such as those related to expressive language, other foundational behaviours such as object manipulation and social development have been found to be associated with play behaviours.
	* **Children living in institutions appeared to play at a level better matching their mental than chronological age** (Mental Age is based on intellectual development.Chronological Age is the number of years a person has lived. When a person's mental age is equal to his actual age, he is said to have an average IQ*)
* In a paper on sport and physical activity in looked after children[^13], it is argued that prolonged participation in sports activities may be an important source of stability and consistency for those living in or leaving care, as it helps reestablish some sense of structure to their lives 

### Limitations of traditional assessment in children's institutions
* It is likely that children living in institutions have had little experience with objects such as toys, balls, and puzzles that are used in these evaluations. It is possible that this unfamiliarity can influence assessment results.
* a weak relationship between play and cognition could also indicate that moderating variables, such as motivation, sense of security, or motor behaviours, were influencing this relationship. 
* Conversely, if institutionalized children demonstrated play behaviours that highly corresponded with standardized measures, it may offer practitioners alternatives during challenging assessments. 

### Policy recommendations for improving play
- [^4]Recommendations to improve play opportunities in low resource settings: 
	* In schools, the need to support social and emotional learning and healthy child development must be held alongside the need to increase academic scores. Otherwise, school engagement might suffer and efforts at creating a better-prepared generation might fail.
	* Supervised after-school programs can be critical to children who live in communities where outside playing might be dangerous or unsupervised. 
	* Community-based programs that offer a wide variety of services, ranging from homework assistance to athletic programs and from character development to the creative arts can contribute heavily to the positive development of youth.
	* Keeping school facilities open for use by community families in the evenings and on weekends when they are usually closed may increase engagement in these activities.
* Udayan Care[^8] recommends that all institutions have Indoor and outdoor games, yoga, meditation, music, television, picnics and outings and cultural programmes, gardening, library, dance, art therapy etc., and child-friendly library


## Play Settings & Schedules 

These recommendations are from the American Academy of Paediatrics

### Varying needs of children based on age

#### Children aged under five
- Children between four and five years are often in a pre-school setting. They have different routines and structures in their day. 
- They’re becoming more independent, self-confident and inquisitive.
- Usually they are content to play with their toys for longer, enjoy doing new things, and will play with or without an adult.
- Playing with your child is still lots of fun but you should encourage their freely chosen play.

#### Suitable playing activities for children this age include:
-   reading or looking at books
-   simple games such as snap, i-spy, snakes and ladders, playing cards
-   outdoor scavenger hunts, picnics, ball games, hide-and-seek
-   adding new items to the dressing up box such as old mobile phones, cameras, walkie-talkies and binoculars


#### School age children
- As children grow up, they become more independent. They also test boundaries, explore their emotions and make friends
- They should be encouraged to follow their own play ideas and instincts.

#### Suitable playing activities for children this age include:
-   outdoor play, traditional games, two ball, hopscotch, tag, bike rides, tree climbing
-   den building using blankets, sheets, fabric, string, pegs, cushions, carpet squares
-   doing arts and crafts such as junk art, building, crafts, sewing, woodwork
-   going to a forest or beach to collect conkers or shells
-   playing in the rain or snow
-   walking to school


#### Post primary children and young people
- When a child leaves primary school, they still need to play. 
- They need opportunities to explore their neighbourhoods, test their boundaries and be outdoors. 
- Their friends and friendship groups are important. 
- Caregivers should encourage young people to be outdoors and limit the time they use mobile telephones and digital screens. They need:
	- time to relax away from study and schoolwork, household tasks or structured activity
	- indoor and outdoor spaces to relax


### Recommended care practices for caregivers
- According to the American Association of Paediatrics, 
	- Provide opportunities for your child to sing and dance.
	- Tell stories to your child and ask questions about what he or she remembers.
	- Give your child time and space to act out imaginary scenes, roles, and activities.
	- Allow your child to move between make-believe games and reality—for example, playing house and helping you with chores.
	- Schedule time for your child to interact with friends to practice socializing and building friendships.
	- Encourage your child to try a variety of movements in a safe environment—for example, hopping, swinging, climbing, and doing somersaults.
	- Limit screen time to healthy levels. Age-appropriate media can have benefits for older children, especially if you watch and play with them. But real time social interactions and play are much better for children than digital media for learning.
	- Encourage your child's school to offer recess and playful learning approaches in addition to more structured learning approaches like reading, memorization and worksheets.

## Challenges in structured play interventions applied accross different institutions
- Context: This study reports the effects of a structural intervention, ENRICH (Environmental Interventions in Children’s Homes) which targeted the physical and social environment within residential children’s homes (RCHs) to increase physical activity (PA) among residents. [^9]
- Hypothesis: 
	- ENRICH was a structural intervention that worked with adult staff as change agents to create a more health-promoting environment in the RCH, which was hypothesized to result in increased PA among children. 
	- Based on theory and expert recommendation, we anticipated that working with organizational change agents to create PA-promoting environments that could be adapted to setting and population needs would increase PA among the children residing there, but this was not the case.
- **Results:The ENRICH intervention had no impact on physical activity of youth residing within RCHs, even after the level of intervention implementation was considered**

### Lessons Learned
- Within the group home setting, it is clear that implementation does not occur in an ordered and uniform process and is influenced by many contextual factors within organizational environments.
- Interventions targeting organizational changes to impact population health behaviors should devote careful attention and provide adequate resources to effectively monitor and document implementation.
- Moreover, contextual factors within organizational settings including the PA environment and organizational capacity to implement health promotion programs are important to consider and should be assessed prior to implementation.
- Future work is needed to examine the different organizational climates and cultures which influence the implementation of health promotion programs and changes to the physical and social PA environment. 



# Play Therapy
- This section is primarily taken from two papers, one on evidence based play therapy[^6] and another one that describes therapeutic interventions in children through play[^7]. 

## What is play therapy?
- As described in a paper on evidence-based play therapy[^6], Founded in 1982, the Association for Play Therapy (APT) formed to develop and promote play therapy as a separate and distinct psychotherapy modality for treatment. 
- Play therapy is a form of therapy used primarily for children. That’s because children may not be able to process their own emotions or articulate problems to parents or other adults.
- Although people of all ages can benefit from play therapy, it’s typically used with children between the ages of 3 and 12. 
- Play therapy may be helpful in a variety of circumstances, such as:
	- facing medical procedures, chronic illness, or palliative care
	- developmental delay or learning disabilities
	- problem behaviors in school
	- aggressive or angry behavior
	- family issues, like divorce, separation, or death of a close family member
	- natural disasters or traumatic events
	- domestic violence, abuse, or neglect
	- anxiety, depression, grief
	- eating and toileting disorders
	- attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
	- autism spectrum disorder (ASD)

## How does play therapy work? 
- There’s a bit of a communication gap between children and adults. Depending on age and stage of development, children simply don’t have the language skills of adults. They may feel something, but in many cases, they either can’t express it to an adult or don’t have a trusted adult to express it to.
- Children learn to understand the world and their place in it through play. It’s where they’re free to act out their inner feelings and deepest emotions. Toys can act as symbols and take on greater meaning — if you know what to look for.
- Since the child can’t adequately express themselves in the adult world, the therapist joins the child in their world, on their level.
- As they play, the child may become less guarded and more apt to share their feelings. But they aren’t pressured. They’re allowed to do so in their own time and with their own method of communication.

## Evidence backing play therapy
These are results from a number of research studies that used play therapy interventions. You can find them listed in more detail in the source papers. [^6][^7]
- These most recent studies have demonstrated the positive impact of play therapy on general behavioral problems
- Results demonstrated that children receiving play therapy showed statistically significant decreases in externalizing behavior problems, specifically conduct problems, and moderate improvements in internalizing behavior problems, specifically anxiety
- Following a treatment of play therapy for child witnesses of domestic violence, children in the experimental group scored significantly higher than children in the control group on self-concept. 
- In therapy interventions for children with learning disabilities, Children who participated in the play therapy intervention demonstrated statistically significant improvement in scores on the BASC-PRF on overall composite scores and internalizing problems over children in the control group.
- In a study that looked at at-risk children, Although there was no difference between groups on anxiety, a statistically significant difference was found between groups on self-esteem and locus of control.
- In a study that looked at short term play therapy with earthquake victims, Results demonstrated a significant decrease in anxiety, as well as a large treatment effect, for children participating in the experimental group as compared to the control group. Suicide risk as measured by the MDI-C was also found to be significantly less in the experimental group as compared to the control group.
- Trostle (1988) found that after 10 sessions of nondirective group play therapy, bilingual Puerto Rican children showed significant improvement in self-control and higher developmental level play behaviors when compared to their control group peer.

## Treatment potential of game technology
Recent studies have used applied games to successfully decrease anxiety or depressive symptoms in adolescents

### Games influence behaviour in children
- Playing games can influence social, emotional and cognitive development. The immersive social context of today’s games help gamers rapidly learn social skills and pro-social behaviour
- playing a prosocial game was shown to induce long-lasting enhancements in e.g. helping, cooperation, empathy and emotional awareness 
- individuals who had played a cooperative game showed more prosocial behaviour in a dilemma task than players who had played competitively, suggesting that these behaviours might be transferable to their peer and family relations outside the gaming environment
- Little is known about the long-term effects of gaming on emotions and mood, although there are reasons to think that gaming may be positive for an individual’s growth and social connection
- Regular games can be used to motivate and engage patients in physical activity and therapy as well
- Games also have the potential to enhance mental health and wellbeing in children and adolescents

#### Video games 
-  Playing video games can enhance problem solving skills and creativity and, mostly action games, have a positive impact on focus and spatial skills
- In addition, a recent study on the consequences of playing video games, identified positive outcome for intellectual functioning, competence in reading, mathematics, spelling and academic achievement
        * On the one hand, games can be used to distract patients and help them to cope with the side effects of treatments, like nausea, vomiting, anxiety, fatigue and pain, much the same as physical play does
        * Computer games may have the same effect as an often more expensive relaxation training.
        * Applied games could be combined with patient-tailored tools to assess a patient’s wellbeing in dedicated e-health platforms to deliver personalized interventions


# Sports & Vulnerable Children 

## Benefits of Sports for CNCP
According to a paper on physical activity and sports in alternative care in Ireland[^10], we know that there are multiple benefits to regular strcutured activity for children 

### Improves Social relationships:
- Participation in structured activities, including sports, has been argued to be associated with better social relationships and mental health, but such engagement is lower for children in care than children  living in their homes
- Sports engagement has been found to facilitate the building of social networks and connections for this population of children.

### Build resilience
- In order to improve long term outcomes, there is a need to build resilience with these vulnerable young people (Gilligan, 2000, 2008), and engagement in sports is argued to allow for the development of such resilient behaviours (White & Bennie, 2015).

### Minimise disruptive effects of changes in care setting:
- Fong, Schwab & Armour (2006) have proposed that in the face of placement changes, continuity of activities should be a priority for this group. They argue this would allow children to maintain regular, familiar and/or normalising activities, which might minimise the disruptive effect of changes in care. In this respect, engagement in sports and sporting activities could be a stabilising factor during a period of change.

### Build confidence:
- In more recent research, children in residential care identified that engagement in sport and PA developed their confidence, competence, character and connections, with positive peer and adult relationships viewed as central to securing positive outcomes from such engagement (Quarmby et al., 2019).

### Better manage emotions and stressful life events:
- In terms of other outcomes, all of the participants discussed how engagement in PA provided a way for the children to develop active strategies to deal with stressful life events. They talked about the potential of using sports as a way to vent and burn energy and for children to manage their emotions

### Develop their identity:
- Participants frequently highlighted sports as an opportunity for children to develop an identity based on a new hobby or activity and based on success and positive experiences in this activity.
- Adolescence is recognised as significant time of identity development for children in care (Gilligan, 2008) and sports was identified in the current research as offering the opportunity for the development of a positive sense of identity, similar to previous research (Lakey et al., 2017; White & Benny, 2015).

## Barriers for children's engagement in sports in care settings:
According to a paper on physical activity and sports in alternative care in Ireland[^10], we know that there are multiple problems with regular strcutured activity for children 

### Experience of Trauma:
- Adversity in life and in particular the experience of trauma and disruption was identified as the most significant barriers for children's limited engagement.
- The impact of previous chaotic lifestyles on current choices and behaviours, was highlighted as one of the main reasons sports was not viewed as a priority for these children.
- Due to adverse life experiences these children can often have lower intra-personal skills than their peers (Fratto, 2016) along with reduced levels of self efficacy (Quarmby & Pickering, 2016a,b) which can directly impact their willingness and motivation to engage in sports. 

### Routine in care settings:
- There was a belief that as children had limited choices in their daily lives in the setting, this often led to a reluctance to engage when offered a choice to participate in an activity. This was further impacted by the fact that children often did not recognise the benefits engagement may provide
- There was a common sub-theme in discussions of the routine acting as a barrier for the children engaging in spontaneous activities. This was recognised as a significant barrier for unprompted engagement
- Quarmby (2014) has similarly suggested that the organisational structure of the care settings and the policies that govern activities can impact the ability of children to engage in sports and activity. The authors argue that the need to plan all activities in advance may reduce the sense of control that children develop in activities, thus acting as a barrier to engagement and their sense of enjoyment 
- Consistent with other research in the area, the staff in the current study felt that children whilst living in residential care may prioritise other areas of their life due to the serious nature of their life, which prevent them engaging in behaviours that may lead to long term positive outcomes, (Berridge, 2017).

### Being under the radar in care settings:
- Several participants discussed how the children in care settings feel that they are being constantly analysed by the professionals, which prevented the children entering a further situation where they were being judged.

### Stigma related to their identity as a child in care:
- The expectation that children would engage with people outside of the care setting, or reveal their identity as a child in care, could lead to fear and act as a barrier to engagement in community based activities.
- This fear of being judged was felt to extend to outside of the care setting for children, and acted as a significant barrier to engagement in community activities. Participants identified that children do not want to appear different to others, and often expressed fear of engaging in sporting activities outside of the care setting for this reason.
- Greater restraint such as having friends over or being able to be on their own with friends after the events was argued to prevent children engaging in sports outside of the residential unit. The participants suggested that children were often fearful of the stigma of being a child in care leading to rejection and so they chose not to engage with others.

### Low motivation and lack of hope in future:
- Within this sub-theme a lack of hope was prominent as being observed in children and a belief that this explained children lack of engagement in sporting. This lack of hope in the future was also linked directly to children’s recognition of the importance of making positive changes in their lives to improve their overall wellbeing
- The motivation to engage in activities was perceived to represent a significant obstacle to children engaging, whilst previously it was suggested that physical access to sports may have prevented engagement.

### Low social skills:
- The participants frequently identified this as one of the major obstacles for the children’s engagement, as they lacked the necessary social skills to join activities with others.
- They talked about how the children were sometimes aware of their lack of social skills and this prevented them from engaging, despite a desire to become involved
- The staff frequently identified the role of previous life experiences on the difficulty children had in developing the necessary social skills, such as lack of engagement in sports and play as young children. 

## Strategies to increase engagement in Sports in care settings:
According to a paper on physical activity and sports in alternative care in Ireland[^10], we know that there are multiple ways of improving  regular strcutured activity for children 

### Recognising and understanding trauma:
- In terms of strategies to increase engagement in sports, there was a common theme of the importance of recognising and understanding adversity and trauma and incorporating this into all work with children
- Based on these unique and individual experiences of children, they  argue that an understanding of trauma informed practice is imperative when working with children

### Trauma sensitive design in sports:
According to a paper on Trauma Informed Sports Programming[^12]
- There are three main concepts that build upon common existing curriculum features: play, skills, and strengths. 
	* Play can lead to the development of competency, executive functioning, and a positive sense of self, which are all crucial in the process of recovery from traumatic experiences. Play activities allow children who have experienced trauma to lessen anxiety and depression and enhance their capacity for pleasure and desire. 
	*  A skills-based focus has been adopted in many treatment approaches and is key in allowing kids to develop competencies in different areas, which can then serve as a platform for identifying strengths. 
	* Identifying and emphasizing strengths can then build efficacy and self-esteem, which is crucial for children with trauma exposure who are often overwhelmed with feelings of guilt, blame, fear, and anxiety.


### Shared experiences:
- Attachment to significant others within the residential setting and outside was a dominant theme that was identified as presenting an obstacle and a facilitating factor for engagement, in relation to family and peers.
- Similar to this, the importance of shared experiences between children and staff was identified as linked to both motivation, further relationship building and as an overall positive outcome from sports engagement.
- Sports was viewed as a way of the children developing these connections, and offering a non-threatening or safe way of developing these.
- Sports and sharing the experience of the activity was further identified as a potential way of helping children to reconnect and extend their relationships with families.
- Similar to this point, sports  was highlighted as an opportunity for staff and children to develop relationships in a non-directive way, and as a powerful strategy for ongoing work with children, as trust developed within the relationship. 

### Informal activities:
- While there was a clear recognition of structured sports within the residential setting, the participants also talked about the importance of non-formal physical activities as a way of working with children, and the perception of choice this afforded the children. 
- Brain suggested that the organic nature of informal activities could be very effective “sometimes if planned the children won't do it but if natural can happen easier, simple as being outside kicking a ball and it can develop into a match. But if you organised a match they wouldn’t engage”.
- Whilst structured sports was identified as important in the current study, the role of informal or unstructured activities was seen as providing control and sense of agency to the children. 
- Informal activities also overcame the issue of children rebelling against structured activities and facilitated the development of skills for spontaneous play and games, which it was felt some children had limited experience of engaging in. 
- The findings in the current study also indicated that informal activities would allow for the development of skills that children could use to further develop relationships with peers

### Constraints of sporting interventions in care:
According to UNICEF's report on understanding the evidence for child-focused sport for development, 
- Successful sport for development initiatives involve multi-sectoral cooperation, such as the inclusion of education and social components.
- Coaches play a critical role in safeguarding children and mitigating possible negative influences.
- There is little evidence to suggest involvement in sport reduces a child’s risk of abuse and exploitation. In fact, when not done well, there are indications that some sports can increase exposure to violence.
- Better evidence is needed for the monitoring of sport for development initiatives, including more research on effective implementation.
- More meaningful child participation in programme design and evidence building is needed.

# Play Assessment:
- According to a paper that describes the importance of play in development[^3], play is an effective tool to study development in children
	-  When play is not being controlled by adults children are not inhibited or conscious and, therefore, one can see them at their best.
	* Play activities help us to know about the child's cognitive abilities.
	* Play also reflects the child's social development.
- A paper that studied the interplay of play and cognition[^3], used 
	- Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 2nd edition (BSID-II; Bayley, 1993). We used the BSID-II to assess children’s general cognitive development. 
	* Play assessment: used two toy sets to assess play. 
	    * The first consisted of exploratory toys comparable to those donated to the institutions. 
	    * The second set consisted primarily of symbolic toys to provide sufficient opportunity to elicit the children’s symbolic play behaviours.
* The same paper on cognition and play[^3] suggests that play assessments may be used by therapists attempting to assess children newly adopted from institutions who are difficult to engage in standardized testing, but able to be engaged in play. 
	* A therapist familiar with a play scale similar to the one used in this study may be able to gauge a child’s developmental status through observing play behaviours.
