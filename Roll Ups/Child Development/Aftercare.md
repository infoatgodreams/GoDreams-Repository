# The Need for Aftercare

- Once a child completes 18 years of age, they cease to be a minor and become an adult — whether living with their family or in the protective custody of the State. This age is significant for two reasons. 
	- One, it marks the end of the State’s responsibility, authority, and rights to care for the child, as per the principle of parens patriae . 
	- Two, the adult, now, possesses a different set of rights and is expected to assume more responsibility and learn to make their decisions more independently. 
- Transition of a young person from supervised CCIs to independent living throws challenges as well as opportunities to build resilience
- Transition period is delicate and requires support and mentoring to make optimum use of resources and to realize their full potential
- Aftercare refers to providing support, financially, or otherwise, to persons, who have completed 18 years of age but not completed 21 years, and have left any institutional care to join mainstream society. 
-  Despite the many difficulties care-leavers face, they have access to relatively few services and even fewer legal entitlements, which in some cases are not even actualized in practice.
- They are left to survive on their own at age 18 or younger, even when legislation makes provisions for them to stay in care longer
- In fact, the availability of appropriate services has a dramatic impact on whether young people thrive or falter, such that &quot;the social ecology that surrounds vulnerable youth is as important as the particular characteristics of the young person in terms of creating potential for change
- A significant and renewed debate – or rather, a social movement – is required that champions the universal rights of care-leavers after they have turned 18 and that strongly supports them in the transition to adulthood
- Formation of an international association of care-leavers that campaigns at a global level for reforms to promote optimal outcomes for youth from care everywhere can help promote the rights of careleavers

## CHALLENGES FACED BY CARELEAVERS
- According to a multinational comparison of caregivers, the findings suggest that employment is the main challenge for care-leavers, being reported by all but two of the countries surveyed
- Not far behind, education, housing and poverty were perceived as main challenges in 31 countries. Isolation or loneliness was observed as a challenge in 29 countries and mental health in 27 countries. Delinquency and substance abuse were reported in 22 countries.
-  Children do not have basic certificates which proves their age, birth place, and caste etc.
  - This makes it difficulty to obtain other important documents such as driving license, Passport, Aadhar card, bank account etc
- Lack of facilities for special need children such as a counsellor or relevant medical facilities.
- The awareness regarding the social security schemes implemented by Central and State Governments which may support in getting these children in need better employment opportunities and other social benefits is low.
- As CLs have been living with minimum interaction with the society, they are also worried to face the world after they leave the home
- The schools and colleges do not have a system for reservation of seats for disadvantaged/orphan children
- The budget of ICPS scheme has not been revised from past 6 years.
- In the Aftercare home there is no permanent counsellor to conduct regular sessions, but in case of requirement, children are taken to a private counsellor.
- There is a good tracking system for the Care Leavers but is not strongly implemented for aftercare adults mainly above 23 or 25 years of age.
- The children (who are between the age of 16-18) feel that they should have a personal mobile phone.

## CHALLENGES AT AN INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL
- The officials who are aware of the functioning of the CCI and their challenges, often get transferred and replaced by a new officer who has no knowledge on the functioning of the CCIs, to make the decisions
- According to the Sponsorship programme under ICPS Scheme, if any child is being migrated from one State to another while he/she is getting a scholarship, then the sponsorship is transferred to the concerned CWC belonging to the State to which the child is being transferred. But the implementation is very poor.
- As there is lack of special needs facilities, it is difficult for them to transfer such children to a facility where there is a provision for special facilities/medical needs.
- If the child runs away, the CCI rescues it and as per the rules, they send him/her to the concerned CWC in their district, which sends the child back to the home, without considering if the parents are capable to rise the child, or if there is a child- friendly environment in the family.

## GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF AFTERCARE
- All aftercare provisions and processes shall keep the best interest of the young person in mind.
- take into consideration individuality, circumstances, background and gender, age, disabilities, sexual orientation, academic abilities, educational and vocational skills, talents,mental and other physical health conditions.
- All young persons shall always be consulted and their opinions are taken into consideration and their views should govern Individual Care Planfor their Aftercare.
- Initiated as early as possible, during the child's stay in the institution.
- Adhere to the highest possible standards of care through adequate provisioning of resources including financial/man power and trainings/capacity building for the personnel working with these children
- respect and uphold the dignity and worth of young persons and ensure rights based approachand non-discriminatory practices
- environment in an aftercare programme should be safe, nurturing and youth friendly so young people will adapt to independent living

## OBJECTIVES OF AFTERCARE
- Enable such children's smooth transition from childhood to adulthood by participation in the community life; 
- Develop qualifications and skills for apprenticeship/jobs/livelihood/entrepreneurship for socio - economic self - reliance;
- Develop life skills for self - esteem, emotional intelligence, communication skills and relationship skills; and
- Develop day - to - day living skills, and citizenship rights and responsibilities for the youth such as financial literacy, identity documents, etc.
- Ensure that the youth leaving care is freed of any stigma attached to their association with the juvenile justice system. 


# Legal & Policy framework

## Global Care-leaving policy and legislation

- Of the 36 countries in the study, 32 (89 per cent) reported that they have legislation that addressed children in care,
- Of the 32 countries, 23 judged their country legislation to be well-developed rather than rudimentary
- Only 17 country participants (47 per cent of the total sample) reported having legislation addressing care-leavers after leaving care and/or aftercare services,
- All the countries reporting no legislation on children in care also had no legislation on care-leavers.
- Thus, while two thirds of countries have well developed legislation for children who are placed into alternative care, only one fifth have well-developed legislation for these children after they leave care.

# SERVICES OFFERED IN THE AFTERCARE MODEL

## PHASES OF AFTERCARE SERVICES
Aftercare shall essentially comprise of the following four phases:
- Preparation for Life outside institution (shall start at the earliest or at 14years onwards when the child is institutionalized/fostercare)
- Assessment of readiness to live independently (between 17 to 18 years)
- Placement in Aftercare: Actual care and support during Aftercare (18+ onwards till mainstreamed)
- Mainstreaming, Exit and follow up post aftercare

## Criteria for selection of organizations providing aftercare support

- registered under JJ ACT, recognized by CWC/JJB as fit person institution
- Five years experience of management of child care institution
- minimum 3 years experience of providing vocation training, and running placement of children in jobs and apprenticeship.
- should also have adequate resources for counseling and mentorship for the young adults.

## SHELTER 
### Accomodation/ Housing
- For those young persons who cannot be restored back and are assessed as not being ready to live independently on their own, accommodation shall be provided
- There shall be separate aftercare facilities for boys and girls but there shall be no segregation on the ground of religion, caste, language, physical disability, mental capability
- Space should be allotted for aftercare programs within community to facilitate the integration process

i) Option I : Living Arrangements : Children will stay in groups of 4 to 8 in an accommodation taken on rent in a suitable, safe residential locality. Here, children will be encouraged to live together as a family unit and learn to share responsibilities of running their own kitchen and home. The Organisation will assist in providing the rent and deposit for the accommodation. 

i) Option II: If the first option is not feasible in the District/State as the number of children is too low or if there is no suitable NGO available, then the DCPU could identify an existing children’s Home which is run by the Government / NGO , where a portion will be earmarked for After Care. 
Living Arrangements: The After Care programme will be housed in a portion of an existing C hildren’s Home, in which a portion has been earmarked for children eligible for after care. The children ca n stay in groups of 4 to 8. There will be a common kitchen for all the children. The institution may have a maximum of 25 children. 

iii) Option III: In metropolitan cities (Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai and Kolkata) a dedicated institution for After Care can be considered in case it is available. Living Arrangements: The children will stay in larger accommodation, with dormitory style arrangements. There will be a common kitchen for all the children. The institution may have a maximum of 25 children. Here, the home is run by the after care organisation including, housekeeping, kitchen etc 

 The Policy and Guidelines for the ‘Integrated Programme of Non - Institutional Family - based Services for Child Protection’ (2019) recommends that aftercare services should be provided in a location where the care leaver has spent a significant number of years unless they wish to move to a different location. This helps care leavers stay in touch with a contact at the CCI who could support their transition to society. However, Prerana’s experience shows that this may not always be possible as sometimes, educational institutions, rental flats, or livelihood training and job sites may not be close to the CCI where the child used to reside. Under shelter, two specific needs have bee n identified: safety, and social protection and security. 

## Safety 2.1.1. 
### Legal Status 

There is a lack of explicit and implicit legal provisions on the requirements of validating the legal status of a supervised aftercare facility, like an Aftercare Home (AH). There is no clarity on the registration of aftercare residential facilities run by voluntary organizations or the government under the JJ Act 2015. 

### Prerana Practices 
- Currently, Prerana does not run a GH on its own per se but is engaged in the Externally - Assisted Group Homes (GH - EA) for girl victims of Commercial Sexual Exploitation and other care leavers above the age of 18. Once four to six girls agree to live together, Prerana assists them with the identification of a residential unit and the registration of the leas e agreement. Sometimes, there are GHs that are being run by older girls with whom Prerana has worked in the past. Girls exiting CCIs might be placed in such GHs with external financial and other assistance provided by Prerana. 

The girls, who have exited t he institutional life as care leavers might not be under the direct jurisdiction of the CWC. However, the CWC may have appointed an individual/ organization to follow up on the youth care leaver post their discharge from the CCI. 

Prerana also works on a few other critical things to assist the care leavers.
- Checks the legal validity of the unit: Prerana carries out a ‘title search’ to assess the legal validity of the dwelling unit/establishment as well as the competence of the individual who is the signing authority. 11 Section 2 (41) of the JJ Act 2015, “open shelter” means a facility for children, established and maintained by the State Government, either by itself, or through a voluntary or non - governmental organisati on under sub - section ( 1 ) of section 43, and registered as such, for the purposes specified in that section; 
- Facilitates the signing of lease agreements: Prerana acts as a link between the real estate agents and the residents. The organization also ensures that the lease agreement is signed in the name of one of the resident/s and not in t he name of the assisting organization. Often, this resident is a senior care leaver who has had some experience of living in a GH or aftercare facility and is in a position to mentor care leavers.
- Audits the residential area : Prerana conducts visits to the units to check the physical safety of the structures (like checking for exposed electrical wires, safety concerns from disasters and hazards), as well as the physical and social environment (such as the proximity to public transit systems). A representati ve from the organization meets the neighbors, maps the basic amenities and community resources available, and acts as a link between the landlord or the real estate agent (wherever involved) and the resident girls.
-  Assigns a duly vetted local guardian : Usually, a woman, who the organization is familiar with or who has volunteered with the organization is assigned to guide and support the residents. This mentor is usually residing close to the GH. The guardians are made aware of Prerana’s Safeguarding and P rotection Policy. 
- Orients the residents with the community: This includes discussions with the residents about setting ground rules for visits by the landlord, and the in - and out - times for the residents. 
- Aids financially to set up the GH - EA, if required: Pays the rent for up to one year, if required. For girls solely pursuing education, Prerana makes the contribution on their behalf for rent and essential services like groceries. 
- Conducts regular follow - ups with the residents: This includes visi ts from an organizational representative (at least twice a month) and regular follow - ups through phone calls. 
- the organization facilitating the GH - EA may also terminate its association after completing the stipulated time period and may be unable to continue providing the assistance. In such cases, termination is planned and structured and in consultation with the Care leaver and CWC (if relevant). In some cases, the residents may approach another organization to provide the continuation of external assistance. In some other cases, the organization may take the initiative to put the resident women in contact with another CSO which is willing to provide the support externally. If the organization facilitating the GH - EA recognizes that the residents are self - reliant and capabl e of running the facility independently, they may decide to exit the formal association with the GH. This, of course, needs to be done with prior consultation and over a period of time, to gradually wean off the assistance and support. 
- Protection and Security 2.2.1. Operational Guidelines The operational guidelines are slightly different in Aftercare Homes (AH) as compared to a GH or a GH - EA. AH can be run by the government, CSOs, or voluntary organizations. Often, they are run by those voluntary orga nizations that have a CCI and extend their services to the care leavers during their aftercare phase. In such cases, the rules of the AH may be similar to that of the CCI, with relatively more independence granted to the now - adult residents. AHs also have their own rules and manuals/SOP/checklists/best practices/guidelines set by the authorities with or without consultation with the residents, to be followed by the residents and staff. In a GH or GH - EA, the rules are set down by the resident girls and facilitated by the organization. 
- Prerana Practices Prerana follows a participatory process and works with the residents in evolving rules  that are in their best interest and address their needs. They are in the form of  ‘self - regulatory mechanisms’; the residents put together a ‘document of rules’ to wh ich all the residents give their commitment. These rules are often revisited whenever required. Prerana’s role is thus that of a facilitator, helping care leavers to lead, make informed decisions and take charge of their lives. 
- Protection Against Vulnerabilities Emanating from Immediate Social Environment An individual who has been a part of the JJ system needs to be in a physically safe space that protects them from abuse, exploitation, harassment or any other forms of violence. In case of an AH or a GH, it is essential that the residence is in an area away from the potential dangers of re - trafficking and re - victimization — and the neighborhood is conducive to their rehabilitation. 

### PRERNA PRACTICES
- Organizes orientations on personal safety: This includes sharing information and contact details of helplines and support organizations in the immediate neighborhood. Prerana also educates the residents about situations where the girls should approach the police station, as well as their rights wh ile at the police station. 
- Creates a system to screen and monitor visits from non - residents at the GH: Since a GH prepares residents to eventually manage a home, visits from guests are only rightful and obvious. For a fulfilling social life, it’s important that the girls learn to build social relations. However, this might not always be easy and carries several safety implications. Prerana educates the girls about such implications, assesses the situation when needed, and facilitates consultation with the r esidents to make rules on visits from outsiders.
- Connects residents with the community : Prerana connects the residents to public resources of the State and the civil society (e. g. local police station, local residential committees) for their safety and security. 
- Discusses issues of online safety: Makes the residents aware of the vulnerabilities and potential dangers for offenses committed online, and the precautions to be taken, in case the girls are faced with such a situation. 

### Prerana Practices In a GH -
- EA, Prerana helps residents understand safety in operational terms and discusses helpful tips t o stay safe since the external, authoritative supervision is limited. Prerana undertakes the following activities to help residents take responsibility for their personal safety
- Helps residents evolve ‘self - regulatory mechanisms’
- Creates a ‘Code of Conduct
- Provides regular individual and group counseling to deal with challenges in independent living
- Installs disaster - mitigation devices, mechanisms, and systems e.g. fire extinguishers. 

# Mobility and Self - Dependence 
A person above the age of 18 years is legally an adult and should not be constrained from moving about freely. Freedom of movement enables self - dependence and makes the 19 residents confident to navigate life on their own. 

## Grievance Redressal and Conflict Management 

Residents Develop a System to Resolve Conflicts Internally 

Collective living is bound to cause differences of opinion and conflict among the residents. These conflicts are to be dealt with constructively and fairly. However, it may not be possible for an organization to always mediate between the residents, making it necessary for them to be equipped with basic conflict - resolution skills, especially at a GH - EA. In the case of an AH, if a resident has concerns that require to be addressed by the organization, there are mechanisms already put in place. 

## Prerana Practices In the GH - EA by Prerana, 
- the residents work together to create certain rules. The organization facilitates sessions on conflict resolution, financial management and safety for the residents. If the conflict or concerns are external, the organization acts as a mediator. 
- Prerana also organizes alumni meetings where the alumni share their learnings of overcoming the challenges of living together. In Prerana’s experience, the informal network of care leavers acts as great support for the care leavers. 
- Prerana undertakes the following activities to facilitate conflict resolution amongst residents:
	- Sets up internal systems of conflict resolution: Prerana sets up systems for residents to meet regularly to discuss all kinds of concerns in group living. The residents can also report to the social worker in case of more serious grievances.
	- Sets up externally assisted systems of conflict resolution : Prerana brings in peers to help conflict resolution. This is done only after the residents agree and want an external set - up. The external peers are also decided and finalized after consultation with the residents.
	- Organizes group and individual counseling sessions: This helps the residents navigate difficult situations at the individual and the group level

## Physical Access 
- To learn how to live independently, residents must be able to access public transit systems from the place of residence to access basic civic amenities, educational and vocational opportunities. Prerana Practices Prerana facilitated an ‘access audit’. It can be a deciding factor in selecting a location for a GH - EA. In certain cases, Prerana provides a predetermined travel allowance or reimbursement . The organization also carries out a hands - on orientation on accessing the public transport systems. 
- Transitioning to an independent lifestyle: After living with others and under the supervision of an institution, transitioning to GH - EA and living in smaller groups can be hard for some. While in the CCI, the girls get used to being taken care of, especially when they are ill. In Prerana’s experie nce, sometimes, girls in the GH call the social worker when they fall sick, and only go to the health clinic when they are accompanied. They might also face difficulties in traveling alone or accessing public transport. In general, many residents still rely on their social worker for instructions. 

### Challenges Faced While Addressing This Need
- Some challenges that Prerana encounters while working to ensure safe and secure shelter are: Finding safe accommodations for girls: Finding a regularized property (which is free from the risk of getting demolished and is equipped with the basic civic amenities) in an already over - populous metropolitan city is difficult. 
- Sometimes, even if such a residence is a vailable, it’s difficult to extend the lease past the initial 11 months due to incremental costs that the residents might not be able to afford. Moreover, during periods of high demand and low supply of housing units, t he renewal of lease agreements can be difficult . 
- Apart from that, finding accommodation for a small group of single, young women is extremely challenging because of certain patriarchal norms in society. Women who stay alone are often stigmatized and frowned upon. 
- Some societies also set limitations to the timings for the girls to abide by, try to investigate the religious and social background of the girls out of curiosity, and hence, put them in an uncomfortable position 
- The newfound independence can also be hard to adjust to for some girls. They may like to stay out till late in the evening to be with their friends. Some have a hard time learning to prioritize savings and end up spending more on clothes, footwear, make - up, mobile phones, etc. as compared to food and hygiene supplies. 
- Navigating group dynamics: AHs may have authoritarian ways to resolve conflicts or handle grievances, but such authority is absent in GH - EA . In cases where the re sidents are self - reliant and driven, this process is facilitated well. 
- However, in cases where residents are not particularly engaged in the process of leading the functioning of the GH, the process of conflict resolution might become cumbersome. When peop le of different age groups stay together, there is a risk of younger residents being dominated or bullied by the older ones. Sometimes, residents also leave the facility prematurely after joining, without ensuring a safe and secure alternative accommodatio n and/or without working on a sound future plan for themselves. This leads to excess per capita cost for the remaining residents . 

### Social vulnerabilities: 
Once supervision is significantly reduced and girls get relatively greater freedom, there may be a risk of exposure to trafficking, re - trafficking, or exploitation. 

Prerana Practices Prerana prepares a contact list of important local medical professionals and hospitals close to the GH - EA. 



## HEALTH 

## BASELINE REALITY
- ### Emotional wellbeing
  - Over 61% CLs faced recurring emotional distress.
  - There is a greater negative impact on the Emotional Wellbeing of female CLs than male CLs.
  - Emotional Wellbeing Index is positively correlated to Aftercare Quality Index and Academic Career Index.

- ### Physical Health
  - 23% CLs did not have any caregiving support available during illnesses.
  - 13% CLs did not have adequate funds for health care
  - A greater proportion of male CLs (12% more than female CLs) had an unsatisfactory Health Index score than females

## HEALTH PROMOTING PRACTICES 
- regular health checkups and benefits under national health mission
- linkages with professional doctors/hospitals which the young person&#39;s can access on his/her own in case of the need
- Mental health care and planning to assess the young persons reality should be mandatory and conducted by mental health experts
- Counselling facilities must be available to all young persons and especially for those with behavioural, conduct and mental disorders


# HEALTH

- Under health, four needs have been identified: nutrition, hygiene, physical, and mental health.

## Nutrition 
Nutrition is a primary requirement for the development of an individual. Several factors impact the nutritional requirements of an individual. 
- One, the stage of growth. During childhood and adolescence, children require a diet that is different from what t hey require when they step into adulthood. 
- Two, the nature of work an individual undertakes. For instance, those engaged in physical activity or sports need specific diets. 
- The required nutrition also varies based on other conditions like pregnancy, PCOD, obesity, certain physical and mental disorders, identified malnourishment. The quantity, quality as well as the frequency and gaps in between the meals may also vary depending on these conditions. 

### Regular Diet 
- A resident must be able to eat a nutritious diet. In an AH, the managing organization takes the responsibility of providing meals and monitors the health of its residents. 
- Prerana undertakes the following activities to help the residents meet their dietary requirements. 
	- Facilitates collective decision - making regarding the food menu: The idea is to help the residents plan and review their menu as well as the roles and responsibilitie s in the kitchen regularly. This also includes facilitating discussions around the storage of cooked food. Since most of the residents are working or studying, they may not have the time to cook all three meals. Hence, sometimes meals are prepared in advance, stored, and warmed from time to time to prevent them from getting spoilt. 
	- Educates residents on safety measures in the kitchen: The social workers discuss and sometimes demonstrate precautions to be taken, especially while using kitchen equipment such as knives, cooking stoves, and gas. 
	- Facilitating dis cussions on budgeting and healthy eating practices: The residents must figure out what proportion of their income should be spent on food. Initially, Prerana helps the residents budget thei r household expenses. If residents are still looking for jobs or have recently moved out of a CCI, Prerana also provides financial assistance. 

### Special Nutrition 
- Special nutrition is the distinct and/or additional nutrition needed for an individual to address their specific deficiencies or health conditions. It is designed based on professional consultations. In an AH, the nutrition needs of an individual are taken care of by the management, but in a GH - EA , this is guided by a range of factors, inclu ding the residents’ awareness of their dietary requirements, access to a professional, and the financial capacity of the members. 
- Prerana helps the residents build an understanding of why they require special nutrition and how they can procure the same. Prerana also pays for special nutrition until a resident has a job or can pay for themselves. This is done through individual discussions and group consultations with the residents — often by sharing information using audio - visual material. 

## Hygiene 
- External to the Premises The victims of CSEC brought before the JJ system, by and large belong to the lower socio - economic strata of society 
- The GH - EAs are not always in a well - provided neighborhood, let alone a luxurious or p lush locality. The hygiene of the neighborhood may be sub - optimum and has to be carefully chosen and maintained. To ensure hygiene in the GH - EA, the external surroundings must be clean and free from stagnant water, toxic waste, solid waste, dump yards, and any other sources of contamination of water and air. Waste - water disposal systems must be in place. While the AHs have their own in - built mechanisms of sanitation, GH and GH - EAs need to be in areas that are hygienic, free from contamination, and have prop er systems of waste disposal and sanitation. 
- Prerana Practices 
	- Prerana prioritizes sanitation as an essential criterion while selecting the accommodation for the GH - EA. Sanitation infrastructure must comply with the minimum standards. 
	- During the initial phase of searching and shortlisting a residence, Prerana ensures that the premises are located away from dumping grounds, are equipped with sanitation facilities, and have access to a waste - water disposal system. 
	- In certain cases, Preran a also engages older resident girls in the process of selecting a residence based on such parameters to train and equip them in making these important decisions. 
	- In urban, low - income settlements like the suburbs of Mumbai city, toilets and bathrooms might not be attached to the home. While selecting a residential unit for the GH - EA, maximum efforts are made to ensure that the residential unit is equipped with the basic facilities. 
		- In certain communities or societies in urban cities, the water supply continues to be scarce and is restricted for certain hours in a day. Thus, the residents need to equip themselves 31 in planning the utiliza tion of the water for drinking, cooking, washing, etc. Prerana also assists the residents in this transition 

- Prerana Practices Prerana undertakes the following activities to help residents
	- Procures hygiene and sanitation materials: Prerana assists and guides residents in procuring items for collective (trash bins, garbage bags, menstrual supplies, sanitation material, water storage containers) and personal hygiene (bathing soap, towels, sanitary napkins, etc). 
	- Facilitates workshops: This includes sensitization and training workshops on hygiene, reproductive health, and safe sex practices. Prerana also helps residents in building personal hygiene habits for themselves and others around them. 

## Physical Health Care 
### First Aid 
- Every kind of injury or onslaught of ill health does not necessarily need professional medical intervention. Many of them such as cuts, minor injuries, etc. can be adequately addressed by immediate non - professional interventions — especially in emergencies. 
- A First Aid Kit has basic medical supplies for small cuts and wounds like cotton, disinfectants, adhesives, anti - bacterial, germicidal, anti - diarrheal, oral rehydration therapy sachets, etc. A First Aid Kit is available on the premises in case of an AH but in a GH or GH - EA, the residents must put together a kit, and regula rly check the supplies for expiry dates. 

### Access to certified medical systems 
- Certified medical systems are needed for the diagnosis and treatment of illnesses, including super - specialized services. Certified systems can be defined as qualified services authorized and recognized by the State. An AH, being a supervised and officially - managed formal residential arrangement, has to create access to certified medical services and a hospital. In GH - EA, on the other hand, the residents are required to be trained on accessing certified medical services — including information about their availability, how to contact them, clarity about payments, how to take and keep appointments, and other tasks. Every resident must be trained in these tasks as anyone might need these services and they should be able to mobilize it. The residents mus t also know about and use of health insurance services. 
- Prerana prepares a contact list of important local medical professionals and hospitals close to the GH - EA. 
- In a GH - EA, Prerana helps residents to buy and put together the items needed for a First Aid kit. Prerana trains the residents about medicines to be used for specific ailments, educates them to c heck the expiration dates of medicines, and replace them. Residents are also informed of the emergency first aid methods until they can access a professional health service. 
- The social worker during her regular visits to the GH ensures that she checks the First - Aid box with the girls. 
- The importance of updating a First Aid Kit is also discussed during monthly meetings as the girls often forget to replenish used medicines or check expiry dates. 


## Mental Health
- Access to Mental Health Services Unlike physical health, mental health is lesser - known to most. Information must be given to residents on what mental health means, how to access mental health services, and ways to tackle mental health stigma and discrimination. 
- Prerana Practices Prerana empanels mental health service p rofessionals, like psychiatrists, therapists and counselors for the residents to be accessed when needed. Stress management sessions are facilitated with the residents by a 35 counselor from Prerana. 
- Following activities are undertaken to facilitate access to mental health services:
	- Need - based visits by a counselor to the GH - EA. 
	- Need - based visits to a psychiatrist. 
	-  Group sessions to discuss the importance of self - care and ways to practice it.  
- Facilitates orientation visits to the hospital: When the young care leavers move into their GH - EA, the social worker plans an orientation visit to the local hospital. In case the 34 care leavers are suffering from certain ailments which need medical intervention, the social worker orients the care leaver on how to avail OPD (Outpatient Department) services in a hospital. 
- Pays for medical care, if required: Early on, when the care leavers have just moved out of their CCIs and into the GH - EA, they might not be equipped to take care of their medical expenses . In such situations, Prerana supports them financially. 
- Creating a panel of doctors that a resident can reach out to, in case of emergency : Through local guardians, Prerana tries to create a pool of doctors that the GH - EA residents can approach in case of any medical emergencies. 
- Encourage young women to invest in a health insurance policy : Initially, the residents might not be able to invest in an insurance policy. Sometimes, Prerana tries to arrange for health insurance for the first year through the sup port of donors. 
- However, the residents must understand the importance of managing their health expenses and are thus encouraged to invest in a health insurance policy themselves after the first year 


SOCIAL PROTECTION AND WELFARE 
Documentation Procurement and verification of documents are essential to establish eligibility for a variety of welfare and development services in both the AH and GH. The documents needed to establish identity and eligibility of social protection/welfare schemes include : birth certificate, caste/community certificate, domicile certificate, school - leaving certificate, Aadhar Card, Voter ID Card, Ration Card, PAN Card, PwD Certificate (Person with Disability) and BPL/EWS Certificate (Below Poverty Line/Economically Weaker Sections) 

## Prerana Practices
- In the last five years, most girls referred to aftercare have had their essential documents such as the Aadhar card, PAN card, bank account, and school - leaving certificate through the CCI. 
- In cases where the resident girls do not possess certain important ident ity documents, the social workers assist the residents in applying for the same. Sometimes, they also provide a reference letter or document through Prerana to aid that process. The social workers also closely follow - up with the resident and the issuing au thorities or local bodies to procure the documents. 

## Challenges Faced When Addressing This Need 

- Errors in the records : Sometimes, when documents are available, there may be a commonly observed discrepancy in the names of the individuals i.e. different names on different documents or spelling errors in parents’ names.
- Social vulnerabilities: Desperation and sometimes, the urgency to seek necessary documents makes individuals vulnerable to frauds and deception. 
- Time - consuming: As there is no single - window ap proach for building one’s set of documents. It takes a lot of time, energy, financial resources and commitment, especially while working with government bodies to procure documents. 
- Updating new information: There is a general lack of clarity on which auth ority is responsible for issuing which document as well as the process for updating personal information on an already existing document. For eg, in case of an Aadhar card, it may be made by the CCI and often the address of the CCI listed in the card with a contact number of a CCI staff member. Once the child moves out, updating these credentials on the card becomes a challenge. 
- The risks and challenges of addressing social protection/welfare needs include:
	- Non - availability of the records: In cases where the original copies of the identity documents are not available, it is a challenge to establish identity or eligibility. The absence of basic supporting documents also makes it almost impossible to procure new documents. 
## Education 

Access to Formal Education Programs Conventionally, formal education is considered as attending regular school. However, certified vocational education, education for individuals with special needs, adult education and distance education are also recognized as formal education. As per UNESCO , formal education programs are those which are recognized by the relevant national educational authorities or equivalent 

Prerana Practices Prerana gives importance to education and encourages children to pursue formal education depending on their interest and capacity to continue the same. 

Prerana undertakes the following activities to assist residents in accessing formal education:
- Develops a directory of resources: Puts together a resource directory of schools, colleges, and distance learning universities to help residents choose options based on their interests. 
- Liaisons with educational institutions : Follow - up with educational institutes on admissions, queries, or challenges that the residents may be facing. 
- Provides financial assistance: Especially to travel (to schools, colleges, etc.) and procure study materials. Sometimes, Prerana may also procure study materials through partners and donors, and sponsor girls interested in completing their edu cation. Admission and tuition fees may also be taken care of through a scholarship. 
- Facilitates mentorship: Actively mentor residents to keep them motivated and avoid drop - outs. This also includes career counseling to help residents make decisions about their future. 
- Access to Functional Literacy Programs Access to functional literacy or basic writing, reading and calculation abilities is important for an individual to live efficiently and independently in society. UNESCO defines “functionally literate” as a "person who can engage in all those activities in which literacy is required for effective function of his/her group and community and also for enabling him/her to continue to use reading, writing and calculation for his/her own and community's development." For illiterate/semi - literate victims, function al literacy, coupled with vocational training, is important to manage their daily life. 
- Skill Development for Employability Self - reliant rehabilitation of residents is not possible without first ensuring their economic self - reliance. Since the residents are largely without any assets, their chances of economic self - reliance depend on sustainable employment. 
- Access to Vocational Training Skill - based training helps in improving an individual’s employability. According to the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), Vocational Education and Training (VET), also called C areer and Technical Education (CTE), prepares learners for jobs that are based on manual or practical activities.  
- - Spoken and written English classes to be encouraged for all young persons and to be taught by a trained teacher on a regular basis
- Assisted to pursue National Institute of open school programme or non collegiate, any continued education or distance learning courses. Can avail scholarships under Children&#39;s Fund
- All young persons must regularly get exposed to various art forms within the aftercare facilities such as music, dance, painting
- Computer education should be provided to all young people so that they get an opportunity to enrich themselves with the technical knowledge
- May be facilitated to join a suitable vocation or enroll in the certified skill development courses offered by the professional agencies and technical institutes
- Efforts to provide skill development to young persons should be done through linkages with Jan Shikshan Sansthan and workshops should be organised

### Prerana Practices Prerana
- actively explores marketable skills for residents through consultations. It seeks to design and administer vocational training p rograms for young adults and care leavers that, eventually, help them land good jobs. 
- The following activities are untaken by Prerana: 
	- Provides referrals to Community - Based Organizations (CBOs) for functional literacy services: CBOs often run literacy programs in various 45 communities for young adults and women managing households. Prerana collaborates with such CBOs and refers girls from the GH who have not pursued formal education or have had limited exposure to a liter acy program.
	- Mapping local resources for the resident girls to access such programs: In the past, some of the girls have been interested in pursuing specific courses like verbal English. Prerana assists in locating cost - effective programs for such residents
	- Maintains a directory of re sources : Prerana puts together a list of vocational training providers along with the nature of the training. 
	- Visits to vocational training facilities : Prerana accompanies girls to centers to make them aware of the registration process and assist them wit h admissions.
	- Provides need - based linkages: Connects the residents with service providers, sponsorship programs, etc. to help them pursue and complete their vocational training programs. 
	- Supports financially: Helps the residents with a travel allowance. Most of the residents are also supported with basic living costs when they first move out of the CCI into a GH and enroll for such training programs. 
	- Liaisons with corporates: Mobilizes corporates for vocation training programs for care leavers with minimal educational restrictions. Makes referrals and follow - ups with the service provider to assess the progress of the girls, and hopefully, translate training into job placements. 

### Job Placement and Preparedness 
Children who have lived in institutions for a long period — until becoming a ‘care leaver’ at 18 years of age, are often deeply unaware of how their expenses are managed by the institution. They do not have to think about arranging funds for their routine an d non - routine expenses 

The Sustainable Development Goals also highlight the need for “decent work” for everyone. 

### Prerana Practices
Core competence or job skill in a relevant trade is an essential condition but it is not sufficient to get a sustainable job. Other skills such as participating in group discussions, interviewing, essay writing, performance in personality - tests, aptitude tests, etiquettes, and manners are very important to land a job. 

- Prerana conducts a one - on - one discussion with the residents about these essential skills, and also partners with corporates and other agencies to professionally train the girls. 

## Life Skills
- Access to Life Skills According to UNICEF, life skills are the “psychosocial abilities for adaptive and positive behavior that enable individuals to deal effectively w ith the demands and challenges of everyday life.” 
- Using the internet responsibly, operating smartphones, taking care of oneself, building relationships responsibly, at work and beyond, etc. are essential to lead a self - reliant life. Apart from that, life skills include making decisions, cultivating empathy, understanding issues of discrimination, peer pressure, self - image, self - esteem, etc. 

### Prerana Practices
- Prerana imparts life skill training through individual and group sessions. These include sessions on understanding relationships, self & social acceptance, problem - solving skills, sex education, essentials of small - group living, self - regulation, peer pressure, consent culture, evolving code of conduct, training on security and pr otection, learning division of work and responsibilities and more recently, cyber safety. 

### Access to Leisure and Recreation 
- Recreation and leisure are a right of every child and should not be perceived as a luxury. It is important to encourage the resident to engage in constructive recreation and leisure for their well - being. Leisure can be defined as ‘free - time’ when no one is expected to work. Recreation is a fun and relaxing activity of positive entertainment. 
- The victims of CSE and other forms of violence have a background of traumatic experiences. Their lives at the CCIs, the uncertainties about the future, and apprehensions of entering the society adds to that stress — and can adversely affect their physical and mental health as well their decision - making capacity. Leisure and recreation go a long way in helping the children destress themselves. 
- Life skills are different from vocation skills and are of three types: 
	- cognitive skills promotes sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.
	- skills for analyzing and using information, personal skills for developing personal agency and managing oneself, and interpersonal skills for communicating and interacting effectively with others. 

### Prerana Practices 
Prerana works to establish recreation as a need - based right for children and young adults and integrates it as an indispensable component of a youth’s development plan. Care leavers need to pursue activities to destress and enjoy their free time. 
- Organizes recreational activities: Involves professional recreation leaders and facilitates the participation of residents in external recreation programs. 
- Establishes constructive recreation as a right of the residents: During the initial discussions, the social workers ensure that an activity of leisure or recreation is included in the residents’ daily schedule. The counselors also engage with the resident girls regularly on the importance of self - care.
- Ensures the participation of and consultation with the residents to identify the scope of interventions for recreation: The social workers and counselors actively engage in shari ng healthy tips on recreation with the residents during their individual and group meetings. 

### Access to Independent Living Skills
- Independence is not to be understood as leading an unbridled or asocial life. Instead, independent living skills focus on self - regulation and taking responsibility for one's actions. 

### Prerana Practices 
- As an integral part of its on - going casework, Prerana conducts regular sessions on small group living. It provides handholding support to the residents, especially during their first year of transition from CCIs to GH - EA. 
- Prerana undertakes the following activities:
	-  Helps to open, access, and operate email accounts 
	- Assists in preparing and updating CV or resumes 
	- Guides in budgeting and living within one's means 
	- Orients the residents on how to interact at the police station and educates them on their rights. 
	- Helps residents to travel independently using publ ic transport 
	- Assists them in learning to cook for a small group, and understanding the importance of a balanced diet 
	- Helps residents interact with their immediate social environment, including the neighborhood committees. 
	- Teaches residents about the basics of banking, including opening a bank account, updating passbooks, etc. 
	- Trains the residents on handling Gazettes 
	- Helps them access helplines and other support services 
	- Organizes recreational activities: Involves professional recreation leaders and facilitates the participation of residents in external recreation programs.
	-  Establishes constructive recreation as a right of the residents: During the initial discussions, the social workers ensure that an activity of leisure or recreation is included in the residents’ daily schedule. The counselors also engage with the resident girls regularly on the importance of self - care. 
	- Ensures the participation of and consultation with the residents to identify the scope of interventions for recreation: The social workers and counselors actively engage in shari ng healthy tips on recreation with the residents during their individual and group meetings. 
	- Teaches them to shop for essentials and groceries 
	- Prerana also encourages the residents to share about their relationships if they feel comfortable to do so. If a resident wants to get married, she is provided with counseling to ensure that she knows what her decision would entail. Prerana also offers to meet with the prospective husband and/or his family only if the resident desires so. Prerana also explains to them the importance of getting their marriage legally registered and shares information on how to go about it. 
	
	To ensure the access to independent living skills, Prerana undertakes the following activities: 
	- Conducts visits to the GH and engages with residents individually as well as in group discussions. 
	- Accompanies the residents to banks, markets, police stations, etc. 
	-  Assists residents in understanding and responding to notices received from various authorities. 
	- Educates the residents about the landlord - tenant relationship. 
	- Assists in managing finances. 
	- Facilitates regular training sessions as per the individual’s needs. 
	- Creates protocols, SOPs, guidelines through discussions and consultation with the resi dents. 

### Challenges Faced When Addressing This Need The challenges faced by Prerana while addressing the development needs of the residents are:
- Location  of  the  GH - EA: The  GH  may  not  be  close  to  the schools/colleges/vocational centers of all the resid ents. Similarly, when it is time to move (in case the lease ends or for other reasons), finding a GH - EA with accessible services is challenging. 
- Access to vocational training programs: Arranging programs for a small group of 5 to 6 residents with differen t needs and capabilities is resource intensive. Non - availability of training material and teachers is another hurdle. Residents who lose jobs require handholding from the organization externally assisting the GH. 
- Personal motivation : Sometimes, it is hard to persuade young girls to choose sustainable vocational optio ns over short - term unsustainable ones. Residents tend to gravitate towards jobs that give them quick and short - term financial relief over a sustainable career option. 
- Social vulnerabilities: Ma intaining confidentiality of the girls’ background and restricting their exposure to vulnerabilities at various stages is challenging. Thus, evolving and mainstreaming protection systems for care leavers become imperative. 
- Navigating group dynamics : Some members may default and create liabilities, thereby endangering the very existence of the GH. Factionalism among the residents affects cohabitation and development of the individual’s capacities in a GH. Thus, it is critical to manage the number of residents in a GH - EA consistently. 

## SOCIAL REINTEGRATION 
- Support Mechanisms 6.1.1. Access to Professional Follow - up Mechanisms Social reintegration is the process of transitioning into society after having spent a significant time in a CCI. 
- It is now recognized widely that institutional life in itself brings certain challenges for its residents that may impact their ability to tra nsition into society. 
- Prerana Practices The JJ system has a limited mandate for professional follow - up of the resident child once they complete 18 years of age. Prerana believes a child, even after completing 18 years, should remain in touch with the JJ system through professional follow - up mech anisms for some time to ensure their well - being and benefit from the safety net. 
- Prerana believes that access to rehabilitation ser vices is required in aftercare until the care leavers — especially the victims of CSE — can sustain and lead their lives on their own. Prerana works with the CWC and ensures that a Follow - up Order is passed before the person turns 18 years, wherever needed. Su pport groups also play a role in fulfilling needs such as shelter, health care, legal aid, development, and social reintegration. 
- To ensure timely phase - out, Prerana transitions from in - person interactions to telephonic follow - up as a first step. Then, follow - ups are moved from weekly to monthly and quarterly basis. Slowly, financial assistance is also withdrawn as the young adult be comes more independent. 
- Prerana maintains contacts with the young care leavers until they exit the GH - EA and keeps the option open for need - based contact. 

### Stakeholder Engagement 
- Community Preparedness In cases of CSE, there is a possibility that the victim might go back to the original community. In such a case, the victim must be prepared to protect oneself. In the c ase of residents who are earning, there may be pressure from families to return back home and contribute financially to the household. However, returning to their families may not always be in their best interest. Thus, it is important for the family and c ommunity to support (if genuinely interested) in evaluating if the move back to the family is the best move for the victim. In extreme situations, the family and the community may even try to disrupt the GH activity as a pressure tactic 

### Challenges Faced While Addressing This Need 
Some of the challenges associated with social reintegration include: 
- Institutional challenges: The facilitating organizations of GH - EA can find it difficult to transition from being actively involved in providing care and protection to facilitating externally and thereby assisting the young adults. 
- Dependence on CSO and vice versa: Victim’s excess ive reliance on the CSO and unwillingness to wean off from the support is also a challenge while reintegrating residents. On the other hand, the externally assisting organization might also take undue interest in the lives of the residents and patronize th em. Unwillingness on the part of the organization to actively make the resident independent and thereby withdraw support.
- Social vulnerabilities: A child victim of CSE could become freshly vulnerable as she gains the newly acquired freedom. The family and the community of the resident may try to disrupt the Group Home.

Provision for at least one State Aftercare Officer in SCPS and a District Aftercare Officer in every district of every state to head the Single Window Support Centre, as part of the DCPU
- ICPs should be strengthened as a tool for planning for the overall development of the child. IAPs should also be developed as a pathway planning post 18 years for independent life, and should be evolved with the close and active participation of the CLs.
- Every state should formulate their aftercare plan guidelines with strong M &amp; E and mechanisms for grievance redressal. Maintain a consent based MIS of CLs. Increase budget for aftercare.
- The process of preparation for transition should equip CLs with information on individual rights and entitlements, basic life skills, community exposure.
