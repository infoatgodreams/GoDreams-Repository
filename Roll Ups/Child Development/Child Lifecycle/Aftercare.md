# The Need for Aftercare

- Once a child completes 18 years of age, they cease to be a minor and become an adult — whether living with their family or in the protective custody of the State. This age is significant for two reasons. 
	- One, it marks the end of the State’s responsibility, authority, and rights to care for the child, as per the principle of parens patriae . 
	- Two, the adult, now, possesses a different set of rights and is expected to assume more responsibility and learn to make their decisions more independently. 
- Transition of a young person from supervised CCIs to independent living throws challenges as well as opportunities to build resilience
- Transition period is delicate and requires support and mentoring to make optimum use of resources and to realize their full potential
- Aftercare refers to providing support, financially, or otherwise, to persons, who have completed 18 years of age but not completed 21 years, and have left any institutional care to join mainstream society. 

## CHALLENGES FACED BY CARELEAVERS
- According to a multinational comparison of caregivers, the findings suggest that employment is the main challenge for care-leavers, being reported by all but two of the countries surveyed
- Not far behind, education, housing and poverty were perceived as main challenges in 31 countries. Isolation or loneliness was observed as a challenge in 29 countries and mental health in 27 countries. Delinquency and substance abuse were reported in 22 countries.
-  Children do not have basic certificates which proves their age, birth place, and caste etc.
  - This makes it difficulty to obtain other important documents such as driving license, Passport, Aadhar card, bank account etc
- Lack of facilities for special need children such as a counsellor or relevant medical facilities.
- The awareness regarding the social security schemes implemented by Central and State Governments which may support in getting these children in need better employment opportunities and other social benefits is low.
- As CLs have been living with minimum interaction with the society, they are also worried to face the world after they leave the home
- The schools and colleges do not have a system for reservation of seats for disadvantaged/orphan children
- The budget of ICPS scheme has not been revised from past 6 years.
- In the Aftercare home there is no permanent counsellor to conduct regular sessions, but in case of requirement, children are taken to a private counsellor.
- There is a good tracking system for the Care Leavers but is not strongly implemented for aftercare adults mainly above 23 or 25 years of age.
- The children (who are between the age of 16-18) feel that they should have a personal mobile phone.

## CHALLENGES AT AN INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL
- The officials who are aware of the functioning of the CCI and their challenges, often get transferred and replaced by a new officer who has no knowledge on the functioning of the CCIs, to make the decisions
- According to the Sponsorship programme under ICPS Scheme, if any child is being migrated from one State to another while he/she is getting a scholarship, then the sponsorship is transferred to the concerned CWC belonging to the State to which the child is being transferred. But the implementation is very poor.
- As there is lack of special needs facilities, it is difficult for them to transfer such children to a facility where there is a provision for special facilities/medical needs.
- If the child runs away, the CCI rescues it and as per the rules, they send him/her to the concerned CWC in their district, which sends the child back to the home, without considering if the parents are capable to rise the child, or if there is a child- friendly environment in the family.

## GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF AFTERCARE
- All aftercare provisions and processes shall keep the best interest of the young person in mind.
- take into consideration individuality, circumstances, background and gender, age, disabilities, sexual orientation, academic abilities, educational and vocational skills, talents,mental and other physical health conditions.
- All young persons shall always be consulted and their opinions are taken into consideration and their views should govern Individual Care Planfor their Aftercare.
- Initiated as early as possible, during the child's stay in the institution.
- Adhere to the highest possible standards of care through adequate provisioning of resources including financial/man power and trainings/capacity building for the personnel working with these children
- respect and uphold the dignity and worth of young persons and ensure rights based approachand non-discriminatory practices
- environment in an aftercare programme should be safe, nurturing and youth friendly so young people will adapt to independent living

## OBJECTIVES OF AFTERCARE

# Legal & Policy framework

## Global Care-leaving policy and legislation

- Of the 36 countries in the study, 32 (89 per cent) reported that they have legislation that addressed children in care,
- Of the 32 countries, 23 judged their country legislation to be well-developed rather than rudimentary
- Only 17 country participants (47 per cent of the total sample) reported having legislation addressing care-leavers after leaving care and/or aftercare services,
- All the countries reporting no legislation on children in care also had no legislation on care-leavers.
- Thus, while two thirds of countries have well developed legislation for children who are placed into alternative care, only one fifth have well-developed legislation for these children after they leave care.

# SERVICES OFFERED IN THE AFTERCARE MODEL

## PHASES OF AFTERCARE SERVICES
Aftercare shall essentially comprise of the following four phases:
- Preparation for Life outside institution (shall start at the earliest or at 14years onwards when the child is institutionalized/fostercare)
- Assessment of readiness to live independently (between 17 to 18 years)
- Placement in Aftercare: Actual care and support during Aftercare (18+ onwards till mainstreamed)
- Mainstreaming, Exit and follow up post aftercare


## SHELTER 
### Accomodation/ Housing
- For those young persons who cannot be restored back and are assessed as not being ready to live independently on their own, accommodation shall be provided
- There shall be separate aftercare facilities for boys and girls but there shall be no segregation on the ground of religion, caste, language, physical disability, mental capability
- Space should be allotted for aftercare programs within community to facilitate the integration process

i) Option I : Living Arrangements : Children will stay in groups of 4 to 8 in an accommodation taken on rent in a suitable, safe residential locality. Here, children will be encouraged to live together as a family unit and learn to share responsibilities of running their own kitchen and home. The Organisation will assist in providing the rent and deposit for the accommodation. 

i) Option II: If the first option is not feasible in the District/State as the number of children is too low or if there is no suitable NGO available, then the DCPU could identify an existing children’s Home which is run by the Government / NGO , where a portion will be earmarked for After Care. 
Living Arrangements: The After Care programme will be housed in a portion of an existing C hildren’s Home, in which a portion has been earmarked for children eligible for after care. The children ca n stay in groups of 4 to 8. There will be a common kitchen for all the children. The institution may have a maximum of 25 children. 

iii) Option III: In metropolitan cities (Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai and Kolkata) a dedicated institution for After Care can be considered in case it is available. Living Arrangements: The children will stay in larger accommodation, with dormitory style arrangements. There will be a common kitchen for all the children. The institution may have a maximum of 25 children. Here, the home is run by the after care organisation including, housekeeping, kitchen etc 

 The Policy and Guidelines for the ‘Integrated Programme of Non - Institutional Family - based Services for Child Protection’ (2019) recommends that aftercare services should be provided in a location where the care leaver has spent a significant number of years unless they wish to move to a different location. This helps care leavers stay in touch with a contact at the CCI who could support their transition to society. However, Prerana’s experience shows that this may not always be possible as sometimes, educational institutions, rental flats, or livelihood training and job sites may not be close to the CCI where the child used to reside. Under shelter, two specific needs have bee n identified: safety, and social protection and security. 

## Safety 2.1.1. 
### Legal Status 

There is a lack of explicit and implicit legal provisions on the requirements of validating the legal status of a supervised aftercare facility, like an Aftercare Home (AH). There is no clarity on the registration of aftercare residential facilities run by voluntary organizations or the government under the JJ Act 2015. 

### Prerana Practices 
- Currently, Prerana does not run a GH on its own per se but is engaged in the Externally - Assisted Group Homes (GH - EA) for girl victims of Commercial Sexual Exploitation and other care leavers above the age of 18. Once four to six girls agree to live together, Prerana assists them with the identification of a residential unit and the registration of the leas e agreement. Sometimes, there are GHs that are being run by older girls with whom Prerana has worked in the past. Girls exiting CCIs might be placed in such GHs with external financial and other assistance provided by Prerana. 

The girls, who have exited t he institutional life as care leavers might not be under the direct jurisdiction of the CWC. However, the CWC may have appointed an individual/ organization to follow up on the youth care leaver post their discharge from the CCI. 

Prerana also works on a few other critical things to assist the care leavers.
- Checks the legal validity of the unit: Prerana carries out a ‘title search’ to assess the legal validity of the dwelling unit/establishment as well as the competence of the individual who is the signing authority. 11 Section 2 (41) of the JJ Act 2015, “open shelter” means a facility for children, established and maintained by the State Government, either by itself, or through a voluntary or non - governmental organisati on under sub - section ( 1 ) of section 43, and registered as such, for the purposes specified in that section; 
- Facilitates the signing of lease agreements: Prerana acts as a link between the real estate agents and the residents. The organization also ensures that the lease agreement is signed in the name of one of the resident/s and not in t he name of the assisting organization. Often, this resident is a senior care leaver who has had some experience of living in a GH or aftercare facility and is in a position to mentor care leavers.
- Audits the residential area : Prerana conducts visits to the units to check the physical safety of the structures (like checking for exposed electrical wires, safety concerns from disasters and hazards), as well as the physical and social environment (such as the proximity to public transit systems). A representati ve from the organization meets the neighbors, maps the basic amenities and community resources available, and acts as a link between the landlord or the real estate agent (wherever involved) and the resident girls.
-  Assigns a duly vetted local guardian : Usually, a woman, who the organization is familiar with or who has volunteered with the organization is assigned to guide and support the residents. This mentor is usually residing close to the GH. The guardians are made aware of Prerana’s Safeguarding and P rotection Policy. 
- Orients the residents with the community: This includes discussions with the residents about setting ground rules for visits by the landlord, and the in - and out - times for the residents. 
- Aids financially to set up the GH - EA, if required: Pays the rent for up to one year, if required. For girls solely pursuing education, Prerana makes the contribution on their behalf for rent and essential services like groceries. 
- Conducts regular follow - ups with the residents: This includes visi ts from an organizational representative (at least twice a month) and regular follow - ups through phone calls. 
- the organization facilitating the GH - EA may also terminate its association after completing the stipulated time period and may be unable to continue providing the assistance. In such cases, termination is planned and structured and in consultation with the Care leaver and CWC (if relevant). In some cases, the residents may approach another organization to provide the continuation of external assistance. In some other cases, the organization may take the initiative to put the resident women in contact with another CSO which is willing to provide the support externally. If the organization facilitating the GH - EA recognizes that the residents are self - reliant and capabl e of running the facility independently, they may decide to exit the formal association with the GH. This, of course, needs to be done with prior consultation and over a period of time, to gradually wean off the assistance and support. 
- Protection and Security 2.2.1. Operational Guidelines The operational guidelines are slightly different in Aftercare Homes (AH) as compared to a GH or a GH - EA. AH can be run by the government, CSOs, or voluntary organizations. Often, they are run by those voluntary orga nizations that have a CCI and extend their services to the care leavers during their aftercare phase. In such cases, the rules of the AH may be similar to that of the CCI, with relatively more independence granted to the now - adult residents. AHs also have their own rules and manuals/SOP/checklists/best practices/guidelines set by the authorities with or without consultation with the residents, to be followed by the residents and staff. In a GH or GH - EA, the rules are set down by the resident girls and facilitated by the organization. 
- Prerana Practices Prerana follows a participatory process and works with the residents in evolving rules  that are in their best interest and address their needs. They are in the form of  ‘self - regulatory mechanisms’; the residents put together a ‘document of rules’ to wh ich all the residents give their commitment. These rules are often revisited whenever required. Prerana’s role is thus that of a facilitator, helping care leavers to lead, make informed decisions and take charge of their lives. 
- Protection Against Vulnerabilities Emanating from Immediate Social Environment An individual who has been a part of the JJ system needs to be in a physically safe space that protects them from abuse, exploitation, harassment or any other forms of violence. In case of an AH or a GH, it is essential that the residence is in an area away from the potential dangers of re - trafficking and re - victimization — and the neighborhood is conducive to their rehabilitation. 

### PRERNA PRACTICES
- Organizes orientations on personal safety: This includes sharing information and contact details of helplines and support organizations in the immediate neighborhood. Prerana also educates the residents about situations where the girls should approach the police station, as well as their rights wh ile at the police station. 
- Creates a system to screen and monitor visits from non - residents at the GH: Since a GH prepares residents to eventually manage a home, visits from guests are only rightful and obvious. For a fulfilling social life, it’s important that the girls learn to build social relations. However, this might not always be easy and carries several safety implications. Prerana educates the girls about such implications, assesses the situation when needed, and facilitates consultation with the r esidents to make rules on visits from outsiders.
- Connects residents with the community : Prerana connects the residents to public resources of the State and the civil society (e. g. local police station, local residential committees) for their safety and security. 
- Discusses issues of online safety: Makes the residents aware of the vulnerabilities and potential dangers for offenses committed online, and the precautions to be taken, in case the girls are faced with such a situation. 

### Prerana Practices In a GH -
- EA, Prerana helps residents understand safety in operational terms and discusses helpful tips t o stay safe since the external, authoritative supervision is limited. Prerana undertakes the following activities to help residents take responsibility for their personal safety
- Helps residents evolve ‘self - regulatory mechanisms’
- Creates a ‘Code of Conduct
- Provides regular individual and group counseling to deal with challenges in independent living
- Installs disaster - mitigation devices, mechanisms, and systems e.g. fire extinguishers. 

# Mobility and Self - Dependence 
A person above the age of 18 years is legally an adult and should not be constrained from moving about freely. Freedom of movement enables self - dependence and makes the 19 residents confident to navigate life on their own. 

## Grievance Redressal and Conflict Management 

Residents Develop a System to Resolve Conflicts Internally 

Collective living is bound to cause differences of opinion and conflict among the residents. These conflicts are to be dealt with constructively and fairly. However, it may not be possible for an organization to always mediate between the residents, making it necessary for them to be equipped with basic conflict - resolution skills, especially at a GH - EA. In the case of an AH, if a resident has concerns that require to be addressed by the organization, there are mechanisms already put in place. 

## Prerana Practices In the GH - EA by Prerana, 
- the residents work together to create certain rules. The organization facilitates sessions on conflict resolution, financial management and safety for the residents. If the conflict or concerns are external, the organization acts as a mediator. 
- Prerana also organizes alumni meetings where the alumni share their learnings of overcoming the challenges of living together. In Prerana’s experience, the informal network of care leavers acts as great support for the care leavers. 
- Prerana undertakes the following activities to facilitate conflict resolution amongst residents:
	- Sets up internal systems of conflict resolution: Prerana sets up systems for residents to meet regularly to discuss all kinds of concerns in group living. The residents can also report to the social worker in case of more serious grievances.
	- Sets up externally assisted systems of conflict resolution : Prerana brings in peers to help conflict resolution. This is done only after the residents agree and want an external set - up. The external peers are also decided and finalized after consultation with the residents.
	- Organizes group and individual counseling sessions: This helps the residents navigate difficult situations at the individual and the group level

## Physical Access 
- To learn how to live independently, residents must be able to access public transit systems from the place of residence to access basic civic amenities, educational and vocational opportunities. Prerana Practices Prerana facilitated an ‘access audit’. It can be a deciding factor in selecting a location for a GH - EA. In certain cases, Prerana provides a predetermined travel allowance or reimbursement . The organization also carries out a hands - on orientation on accessing the public transport systems. 
- Transitioning to an independent lifestyle: After living with others and under the supervision of an institution, transitioning to GH - EA and living in smaller groups can be hard for some. While in the CCI, the girls get used to being taken care of, especially when they are ill. In Prerana’s experie nce, sometimes, girls in the GH call the social worker when they fall sick, and only go to the health clinic when they are accompanied. They might also face difficulties in traveling alone or accessing public transport. In general, many residents still rely on their social worker for instructions. 

### Challenges Faced While Addressing This Need
- Some challenges that Prerana encounters while working to ensure safe and secure shelter are: Finding safe accommodations for girls: Finding a regularized property (which is free from the risk of getting demolished and is equipped with the basic civic amenities) in an already over - populous metropolitan city is difficult. 
- Sometimes, even if such a residence is a vailable, it’s difficult to extend the lease past the initial 11 months due to incremental costs that the residents might not be able to afford. Moreover, during periods of high demand and low supply of housing units, t he renewal of lease agreements can be difficult . 
- Apart from that, finding accommodation for a small group of single, young women is extremely challenging because of certain patriarchal norms in society. Women who stay alone are often stigmatized and frowned upon. 
- Some societies also set limitations to the timings for the girls to abide by, try to investigate the religious and social background of the girls out of curiosity, and hence, put them in an uncomfortable position 
- The newfound independence can also be hard to adjust to for some girls. They may like to stay out till late in the evening to be with their friends. Some have a hard time learning to prioritize savings and end up spending more on clothes, footwear, make - up, mobile phones, etc. as compared to food and hygiene supplies. 
- Navigating group dynamics: AHs may have authoritarian ways to resolve conflicts or handle grievances, but such authority is absent in GH - EA . In cases where the re sidents are self - reliant and driven, this process is facilitated well. 
- However, in cases where residents are not particularly engaged in the process of leading the functioning of the GH, the process of conflict resolution might become cumbersome. When peop le of different age groups stay together, there is a risk of younger residents being dominated or bullied by the older ones. Sometimes, residents also leave the facility prematurely after joining, without ensuring a safe and secure alternative accommodatio n and/or without working on a sound future plan for themselves. This leads to excess per capita cost for the remaining residents . 

### Social vulnerabilities: 
Once supervision is significantly reduced and girls get relatively greater freedom, there may be a risk of exposure to trafficking, re - trafficking, or exploitation. 

Prerana Practices Prerana prepares a contact list of important local medical professionals and hospitals close to the GH - EA.
