# The Need for Aftercare

- Transition of a young person from supervised CCIs to independent living throws challenges as well as opportunities to build resilience
- Transition period is delicate and requires support and mentoring to make optimum use of resources and to realize their full potential

## Challenges faced by careleavers

- According to a multinational comparison of caregivers, the findings suggest that employment is the main challenge for care-leavers, being reported by all but two of the countries surveyed
- Not far behind, education, housing and poverty were perceived as main challenges in 31 countries. Isolation or loneliness was observed as a challenge in 29 countries and mental health in 27 countries. Delinquency and substance abuse were reported in 22 countries.


## Guiding Principles for Aftercare

- All aftercare provisions and processes shall keep the best interest of the young person in mind.
- take into consideration individuality, circumstances, background and gender, age, disabilities, sexual orientation, academic abilities, educational and vocational skills, talents,mental and other physical health conditions.
- All young person&#39;s shall always be consulted and their opinions are taken into consideration and their views should govern Individual Care Planfor their Aftercare.
- Initiated as early as possible, during the child&#39;s stay in the institution.
- Adhere to the highest possible standards of care through adequate provisioning of resources including financial/man power and trainings/capacity building for the personnel working with these children
- respect and uphold the dignity and worth of young persons and ensure rights based approachand non-discriminatory practices
- environment in an aftercare programme should be safe, nurturing and youth friendly so young people will adapt to independent living

# Legal & Policy framework

## Global Care-leaving policy and legislation

- Of the 36 countries in the study, 32 (89 per cent) reported that they have legislation that addressed children in care,
- Of the 32 countries, 23 judged their country legislation to be well-developed rather than rudimentary
- Only 17 country participants (47 per cent of the total sample) reported having legislation addressing care-leavers after leaving care and/or aftercare services,
- All the countries reporting no legislation on children in care also had no legislation on care-leavers.
- Thus, while two thirds of countries have well developed legislation for children who are placed into alternative care, only one fifth have well-developed legislation for these children after they leave care.
