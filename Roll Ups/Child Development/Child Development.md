Typical developmental profile
Typical developmental delays in institutional care 
Caregiving interventions to improve development indicators


## Impact of Institutionalisation

According to a meta-analysis of over 70 years of intervention studies on cognitive development, these are the common failings in institutional care[^1]
- Orphanages usually do not meet the conditions of the average expectable environment, a prerequisite for children’s normal development, encompassing protective, stable caregiving and open opportunities for exploration and mastery of the world. 
- In this respect, institutional care implies structural neglect. Numerous studies have shown that children growing up in orphanages are at risk in various domains of functioning, including their physical, socio-emotional and cognitive development

## Physical Development Delays

### Height & Weight

- According to a meta analysis on interventions to improve development outcomes in children[^1], 
	- With regard to physical development, institutional care has shown dramatic negative effects on growth, with a major affect, reflecting the association between height and duration of stay in the orphanage
	- Often it is not (only) deficiencies in nutrition or medical care that cause growth retardation, but that these growth delays are also the result of socio-emotional neglect.
- According to a paper on caregiving disruptions and their effect on development, we see that[^2]
	- Increasing disruptions in the caregiving environment were related to decreasing rates of growth in height in foster care group and weight in institutionalized group and foster care group, but not BMI.

## Cognitive Development Delays
- According to a meta analysis on interventions to improve development outcomes in children[^1]
	- Children living in orphanages are often markedly delayed, to the point of apparent mental retardation that disappears with improving environments. 
	- The absolute difference in IQ between institutionalized and family-reared children of 20 IQ points. 

## Occipital frontal circumference (OFC):
- According to a paper on caregiving disruptions and their effect on development, we see that[^2]
  - Despite placement in a more stable, nurturing, and stimulating environment, head circumference, a surrogate for brain size, did not significantly improve in foster care group between baseline and 12 years.

## Pubertal Development 


# Interventions to improve cognitive development

## Foster Care & Adoption

- [^1]In a randomized control trial the Bucharest Early Intervention Project showed that foster care as an intervention improved the cognitive outcome of children substantially (Nelson et al., 2007).
- The remarkable catch-up shown by adopted children in comparison with their peers who remain behind in institutional care (e.g., Rutter et al., 1998; Van IJzendoorn & Juffer, 2006) cannot for the greater part be ascribed to selection bias

## Successful interventions include one or many of the following components: 
- According to a meta-analysis that described different interventions in instituional children, these components are seen in successful interventions that improve cognitive performance[^1],  
	- Regular visual and auditory stimulation 
	- Impersonal tactile stimulation
	- Decreased child-caregiver ratio
	- Personal relationship with one caregiver 
	- Increased caregiver stability 
	- Sensitive interaction with children
	- Personal care 
	- Pre-school attendance 
	- Impersonal stimulation of exploration 
	- Cognitive stimulation 
	- Structured play 



# Factors that affect developmental outcomes
## Timing 

 - According to a meta analysis on interventions to improve development outcomes in children[^1]
	- The timing of the intervention however made a significant difference. Interventions starting before the first birthday of the child were significantly more effective  than interventions starting at a later age. 
	- Effect of interventions decreased with increasing age of the children at the start of the intervention. 
	- Interventions with children younger than 12 months were more effective than interventions starting at a later age. Similar effects have been found for children’s physical growth

## Stability in Caregiving
- According to a paper that studies disruptions in caregiving and their effect on development in children[^2],  Aside from group differences in growth, the compromised height and weight growth patterns linked to individual differences in caregiver disruptions in foster care group underscore the importance of a consistent caregiving environment for child well-being.
