Typical developmental profile
Typical developmental delays in institutional care 
Caregiving interventions to improve development indicators


# Impact of Institutionalisation

According to a meta-analysis of over 70 years of intervention studies on cognitive development, these are the common failings in institutional care[^1]
- Orphanages usually do not meet the conditions of the average expectable environment, a prerequisite for children’s normal development, encompassing protective, stable caregiving and open opportunities for exploration and mastery of the world. 
- In this respect, institutional care implies structural neglect. Numerous studies have shown that children growing up in orphanages are at risk in various domains of functioning, including their physical, socio-emotional and cognitive development

## Impact of Parent-Child Separation
- According to a paper on the developmental effects of parent-child separation[^3], we learn that 
	- Experiencing persecution, conflict, war, or disaster in childhood has well-documented negative impacts on children’s health, learning, well-being, and educational progress.
	- Separation of children and parents in these contexts both removes this important source of mitigating adversity and compounds the stress and trauma that a child experiences, amounting to a potentially devastating developmental and psychological impact.
	- Disruptions in attachment were therefore conceptualized as the key mechanism linking parent-child separation to emotional and behavioural problems.
		- Secure attachment, for example, was found to protect against the vulnerabilities posed by institutionalization, early deprivation such as household income poverty, and other risks experienced during childhood.
	- There is evidence of disruptions in adult–child relationships, peer relationships, and physiological processes as mechanisms because of parental separation


## Physical Development Delays

### Height & Weight

- According to a meta analysis on interventions to improve development outcomes in children[^1], 
	- With regard to physical development, institutional care has shown dramatic negative effects on growth, with a major affect, reflecting the association between height and duration of stay in the orphanage
	- Often it is not (only) deficiencies in nutrition or medical care that cause growth retardation, but that these growth delays are also the result of socio-emotional neglect.
- According to a paper on caregiving disruptions and their effect on development, we see that[^2]
	- Increasing disruptions in the caregiving environment were related to decreasing rates of growth in height in foster care group and weight in institutionalized group and foster care group, but not BMI.

## Occipital frontal circumference (OFC)
- According to a paper on caregiving disruptions and their effect on development, we see that[^2]
  - Despite placement in a more stable, nurturing, and stimulating environment, head circumference, a surrogate for brain size, did not significantly improve in foster care group between baseline and 12 years.


## Cognitive Development Delays
- According to a meta analysis on interventions to improve development outcomes in children[^1]
	- Children living in orphanages are often markedly delayed, to the point of apparent mental retardation that disappears with improving environments. 
	- The absolute difference in IQ between institutionalized and family-reared children of 20 IQ points. 
- According to a paper on the developmental effects of parent-child separation[^3]
	-  we learn that the impact includes poorer brain functioning, smaller brain size, lower levels of cognition, and elevated social/behavioural problems, specifically disinhibition, inattention, hyperactivity, and attachment disruptions.
	- At age 16, early-emerging deficits in problem-solving, attention, spatial planning, and short-term visual attention persisted into adolescence, and the gap in spatial working memory between once-institutionalized and never-institutionalized children widened in comparison to earlier in childhood.

## Pubertal Development 

- According to a paper on caregiving disruptions and their effect on development, we see that[^2]
	- Institutionalized group boys showed lower Tanner scores compared with foster care group and family care group. *The Tanner scale (also known as the Tanner stages or Sexual Maturity Rating (SMR)) is a scale of physical development in children, adolescents and adults. The scale defines physical measurements of development based on external primary and secondary sex characteristics, such as the size of the breasts, genitals, testicular volume and development of pubic hair.* 
	- A previous survey of pubertal development in children experiencing severe deprivation within Romanian orphanages revealed that the onset of puberty was delayed by approximately 2.5 years in girls and 1.5 years in boys.
	- Despite expectations of altered pubertal tempo, the only difference noted was that Tanner scores at age 12 years in institutionalized group boys were lower compared with both foster care group and family care group boys. Tanner development and age of menarche were comparable among girls in institutionalized group, foster care group, and family care group.



# Interventions to improve cognitive development

## Foster Care & Adoption

- [^1]In a randomized control trial the Bucharest Early Intervention Project showed that foster care as an intervention improved the cognitive outcome of children substantially (Nelson et al., 2007).
- The remarkable catch-up shown by adopted children in comparison with their peers who remain behind in institutional care (e.g., Rutter et al., 1998; Van IJzendoorn & Juffer, 2006) cannot for the greater part be ascribed to selection bias
- According to a paper that studied the effects of parental separation[^3], 
	- children who are placed in foster care before 24 months of age are more likely to have secure attachments despite their early time in institutional care 
	* show cognitive development scores in the normal range.
	* at 42 and 54 months old, children who had been placed in foster care showed cognitive gains over their peers who remained in orphanages.
	* Placement in foster care also improves electroencephalogram measures of brain activity, relative to those who remained in institutional care.

## Successful interventions include one or many of the following components: 
- According to a meta-analysis that described different interventions in instituional children, these components are seen in successful interventions that improve cognitive performance[^1],  
	- Regular visual and auditory stimulation 
	- Impersonal tactile stimulation
	- Decreased child-caregiver ratio
	- Personal relationship with one caregiver 
	- Increased caregiver stability 
	- Sensitive interaction with children
	- Personal care 
	- Pre-school attendance 
	- Impersonal stimulation of exploration 
	- Cognitive stimulation 
	- Structured play 



# Factors that affect developmental outcomes
## Time & Timing
*Generally, the earlier and younger that children leave institutional care for stable foster care or adoption, the better it is for their outcomes and trajectory.*

 - According to a meta analysis on interventions to improve development outcomes in children[^1]
	- The timing of the intervention however made a significant difference. Interventions starting before the first birthday of the child were significantly more effective  than interventions starting at a later age. 
	- Effect of interventions decreased with increasing age of the children at the start of the intervention. 
	- Interventions with children younger than 12 months were more effective than interventions starting at a later age. Similar effects have been found for children’s physical growth
- According to a paper on the developmental effects of parental separation, 
	- Length of time in an institution appears to be negatively associated with developmental outcomes.  
	- Cognitive recovery was inversely related to the length of stay in institutional care.
	- prolonged residence in orphanages led to higher neuropsychological deficits in memory, attention, and inhibitory control but similar levels to peers in auditory processing, rule acquisition, and planning
	- At 18 months of age or after, parasympathetic nervous system reactivity was negatively affected into early adolescence (age 12).
	- For children placed at or after 15 months old, expressive language and receptive language were negatively impacted into early childhood but not later.
	- When placed at or after 24 months of age, a child’s IQ, attachment organization, and security were negatively affected into early childhood. 
	- those placed before 30 months of age showed growth in their learning and visual-spatial memory such that they were indistinguishable from other children by age 16.

## Stability in Caregiving
- According to a paper that studies disruptions in caregiving and their effect on development in children[^2],  Aside from group differences in growth, the compromised height and weight growth patterns linked to individual differences in caregiver disruptions in foster care group underscore the importance of a consistent caregiving environment for child well-being.
- Thus, although we did not observe major changes in pubertal development among groups, caregiving disruptions deserve further investigation as a factor that could moderate changes in pubertal tempo in girls and boys.
