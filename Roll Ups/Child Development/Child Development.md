# Principles of development
According to a paper on development[^8], Several recurring developmental principles or themes are important to keep in mind when defining normal development and identifying growth processes and milestones

### Nature and nurture
* There is an interaction between nature and nurture, that influences development
* For mental health professionals, it is necessary to consider the extent of their child clients’ normal or atypical development, it is important to recognize the complex interplay of nature and nurture and how this contributes to the clients’ clinical presentations.

### Developmental timing and plasticity
* Normal child development occurs on a continuum, ranging from children whose physical, cognitive, social-emotional, and behavioral development may lag behind those of their peers, to children who are precocious, meeting or surpassing developmental milestones before most children their age. Even still, a majority of children who develop slightly earlier or later than their peers may do so within a “normal” timeframe.
* It is useful to keep in mind that, barring early mental or physical disorders, lapses in development and deviations from the norm at different points in time are not necessarily predictive of subsequent developmental deficits or delays. Instead, children typically continue to grow and change. 
* Traits or skills can be altered throughout the lifespan although they typically are more malleable earlier in development. This notion of plasticity is an important characteristic of normal child development. 

### Critical and sensitive periods
* Critical period: A critical period is a limited time that begins and ends abruptly during which a specific function develops. If the conditions for development are not available during that time it may be extremely difficult or even impossible to develop these functions later in life. 
* Sensitive period: A sensitive period is a time when it is easiest for children to acquire certain skills. It is similar to a critical period in that it is a time of optimal development, but it is best understood as a time of maximum sensitivity that begins and ends more gradually and is more amenable to recovery

### Role of culture and context
* development may vary considerably within and across racial/ethnic and cultural groups. 
* They may also vary according to other contextual differences including historical era, community, or socioeconomic status.
* Nature and timing of some capabilities are less likely to vary across context, particularly in physical and cognitive domains. Skills and behaviors— such as cooing and babbling, initiation of speech, or the ability to use abstract reasoning—develop in a more species-specific pattern; they are all capabilities that are unlikely to differ cross-culturally


# Domains of Development
According to a paper on development, we learn about the different types of development to pay attention to[^8], 


### Cognitive development 
- focuses on changes and growth in internal mental processes, such as -concrete and abstract thinking, reasoning, problem-solving, memorizing, recalling, planning, imaging, and creating.

### Linguistic development
* linguistic development domain references the child’s communication skills, developing speech patterns, and sentence structuring.

### Social-emotional development
* The social-emotional domain involves the development of relationships with others and the learning of social norms and customs, as well as growth in the ability to identify, understand, express, and modulate one’s feelings. 

### Behavioral development
* Behavioral milestones refer broadly to the child’s development of age-appropriate behavior, such as - following rules/regulating deviant behavior.


# Young Adult Development  Model 
According to this framework published by the Young Adult Success Project at UChicago,  The young adult success model posits three factors that are most directly related to positive outcomes in young adulthood
- competencies, complex sets of abilities that allow individuals to perform roles, navigate contexts and adapt to different needs and demands
- integrated identity, a coherent sense of self across time, contexts and include multiple aspects of one’s identity and
	- agency, the ability to determine one’s own life path rather than being subject to external forces

## Settings that favour development
- physical and psychological safety
- appropriate structure
- supportive relationships
- opportunities to belong
- positive social norms
- support of efficacy and mattering
- opportunities for skill-building and
- integration across multiple contexts 


# Impact of Institutionalisation

According to a meta-analysis of over 70 years of intervention studies on cognitive development, these are the common failings in institutional care[^1]
- Orphanages usually do not meet the conditions of the average expectable environment, a prerequisite for children’s normal development, encompassing protective, stable caregiving and open opportunities for exploration and mastery of the world. 
- In this respect, institutional care implies structural neglect. Numerous studies have shown that children growing up in orphanages are at risk in various domains of functioning, including their physical, socio-emotional and cognitive development

## Impact of Parent-Child Separation
- According to a paper on the developmental effects of parent-child separation[^3], we learn that 
	- Experiencing persecution, conflict, war, or disaster in childhood has well-documented negative impacts on children’s health, learning, well-being, and educational progress.
	- Separation of children and parents in these contexts both removes this important source of mitigating adversity and compounds the stress and trauma that a child experiences, amounting to a potentially devastating developmental and psychological impact.
	- Disruptions in attachment were therefore conceptualized as the key mechanism linking parent-child separation to emotional and behavioural problems.
		- Secure attachment, for example, was found to protect against the vulnerabilities posed by institutionalization, early deprivation such as household income poverty, and other risks experienced during childhood.
	- There is evidence of disruptions in adult–child relationships, peer relationships, and physiological processes as mechanisms because of parental separation


## Effect of Trauma on Development
From a review on the impact of trauma on child development, we now know that
- #### General cognitive and language delay
	- On the whole, children exposed to neglect may be more vulnerable to general delays in cognitive and language development.  Neglected children and those raised in poverty may be more at risk of general cognitive delay than those exposed to abuse 
	- Among abused children, increasing severity of abuse is associated with lowered IQ relative to matched controls 
	- The presence of PTSD appears to affect cognitive functioning. Studies show that children with PTSD subsequent to abuse have lower verbal IQ on assessment, suggesting that the presence of PTSD rather than abuse _per se_ may be more relevant
	- The IQ scores of those children exposed to domestic violence was found to be eight points lower than children who were not exposed to violence; after controlling for the effects of genetics and other forms of maltreatment

- #### Problems with memory: 
	- There is reasonable evidence that memory is affected by trauma and adversity. Brain structures that are associated with memory consolidation have been found to differ in adults (but not children) who report a history of abuse.

- #### Bias in the processing of social/emotional information
	- There is some evidence that social and emotional information is processed differently among children that have experienced abuse. The amygdala, an area of the brain associated with the automatic (pre-conscious) processing of emotional information, has been shown to be over-responsive to emotional stimuli (e.g., angry faces) in studies of abused children

- ##### Metacognitive skills
	- Neuropsychological research suggests that children who have experienced neglect and physical abuse can experience problems in auditory attention and cognitive flexibility (problem-solving and planning)

- ##### Behavioural regulation
	- Compared to non-neglected peers, emotionally neglected children may have less efficient brain activity during tasks that require inhibitory control, suggesting that neglect is associated with poor ability to self-regulate and inhibit responses



## Physical Development Delays
### Height & Weight
- According to a meta analysis on interventions to improve development outcomes in children[^1], 
	- With regard to physical development, institutional care has shown dramatic negative effects on growth, with a major affect, reflecting the association between height and duration of stay in the orphanage
	- Often it is not (only) deficiencies in nutrition or medical care that cause growth retardation, but that these growth delays are also the result of socio-emotional neglect.
- According to a paper on caregiving disruptions and their effect on development, we see that[^2]
	- Increasing disruptions in the caregiving environment were related to decreasing rates of growth in height in foster care group and weight in institutionalized group and foster care group, but not BMI.

### Occipital frontal circumference (OFC)
- According to a paper on caregiving disruptions and their effect on development, we see that[^2]
  - Despite placement in a more stable, nurturing, and stimulating environment, head circumference, a surrogate for brain size, did not significantly improve in foster care group between baseline and 12 years.



## Cognitive Development Delays
- According to a meta analysis on interventions to improve development outcomes in children[^1]
	- Children living in orphanages are often markedly delayed, to the point of apparent mental retardation that disappears with improving environments. 
	- The absolute difference in IQ between institutionalized and family-reared children of 20 IQ points. 
- According to a paper that studied IQ in children in institutional care in the North-West in India, the institutionalized males as well as females reported lower IQ.  More than half of the institutionalized subjects were significantly below the average IQ levels (IQ below 70). 
- According to a paper on the developmental effects of parent-child separation[^3]
	-  we learn that the impact includes poorer brain functioning, smaller brain size, lower levels of cognition, and elevated social/behavioural problems, specifically disinhibition, inattention, hyperactivity, and attachment disruptions.
	- At age 16, early-emerging deficits in problem-solving, attention, spatial planning, and short-term visual attention persisted into adolescence, and the gap in spatial working memory between once-institutionalized and never-institutionalized children widened in comparison to earlier in childhood.
- According to a paper that studied impact of institutionalisation on child development[^12], 
	-  Morison et al. (1995) found that 78%  of orphanage children were **delayed in all four  areas of development (personal–social, gross  motor, fine motor–adaptive, and language development)** 


## Pubertal Development 
- According to a paper on caregiving disruptions and their effect on development, we see that[^2]
	- Institutionalized group boys showed lower Tanner scores compared with foster care group and family care group. *The Tanner scale (also known as the Tanner stages or Sexual Maturity Rating (SMR)) is a scale of physical development in children, adolescents and adults. The scale defines physical measurements of development based on external primary and secondary sex characteristics, such as the size of the breasts, genitals, testicular volume and development of pubic hair.* 
	- A previous survey of pubertal development in children experiencing severe deprivation within Romanian orphanages revealed that the onset of puberty was delayed by approximately 2.5 years in girls and 1.5 years in boys.
	- Despite expectations of altered pubertal tempo, the only difference noted was that Tanner scores at age 12 years in institutionalized group boys were lower compared with both foster care group and family care group boys. Tanner development and age of menarche were comparable among girls in institutionalized group, foster care group, and family care group.


## Pyschosocial Development Delays
- According to a paper that sudies the developmental effects of parental separation, when there is volitional separation (parents leave for better pastures), we see that 
	- children separated from their mothers for 4 years or longer reported significantly higher-level anxiety and depression symptoms than those who were never separated, controlling for developmental level and country of origin.
	- Children who were left behind by migrating parents had poorer school performance; increased feelings of abandonment, anger, and loneliness; and more sleep complaints.
- According to a paper on the Petersburg-USA orphanage study[^5], 
	- Children assessed in adolescence had the highest levels of problems. This was true across all subscales of the CBCL [Child Behavior Checklist], with the highest rates for attention and externalizing problems.
	- This suggests the possibility of a single mechanism underlying the development of persistent behavior problems, perhaps the neurobiological consequences of chronic stress in the institution. 
	- Similar to the results for behavior problems, social skills were worse for later-adopted children, and the relation was again a step-like increase at an age-at-adoption of 18 months.
- According to a paper on the consequences of early institutionalisation[^11], 
	- Institutionalized children also commonly display certain specific behaviors that are rare among parent-reared children, such as:
		- stereotypies or self-stimulation (e.g., rocking, head banging, arm waving). 			-  *In the general absence of sensory stimulation  and soothing by adults, for example, by rocking, children may learn to provide their own  stimulation or soothing by making stereotyped movements.* 
		- problems with attention and activity control, 
		- internalizing and externalizing behavior, 
		- high rates of disorganized or unscoreable attachment on the Strange Situation Procedure, 
		- and indiscriminate friendliness.
	- According to a paper on the impact of institutionalisation on child development, 			the unwillingness to interact with peers further prevents them  from learning normal patterns of social interaction. When they do become comfortable  enough to interact with peers in their new environment, they externalize (“act out”) in unacceptable ways that do not endear them to those peers. 
		- Children in residential care were also found to have difficulties in both the affective and cognitive dimensions of empathy, and they manifested low levels of empathic stress and empathic joy, which resulted in a coping style oriented towards the self


## Executive Function Delays
- [^5]Older-adopted children displayed lower inhibitory control and poorer working memory than children adopted at younger ages, but the groups did not differ significantly on a spatial self-ordered search task, which measures spatial working memory. 
- Children with this kind of difficulty can benefit from highly structured environments where expectations are clear. 
- They can benefit from prompts to stay on task and the use of pre-arranged strategies to let them know when a transition is pending. These can include advanced warnings, using timers, and visual cues (e.g., paper chain links or a timer to count down to the end of an activity).


## Language Development Delays
- According to the study on St. Petersburg USA Orphanage intervention[^5], Children adopted before 12 months of age displayed levels of expressive and receptive language skills
- In contrast, language proficiency was lower for children adopted after 12 months of age in both the expressive and receptive domains. 
- Language acquisition delays (i.e., delays in developing speech and vocabulary) mean that affected children may struggle with verbally mediated counselling approaches that rely on oral language competence, such as narrative therapies and restorative justice approaches.



# Reasons for delayed cognitive development in institutions

## Care in large groups:
- In a groundbreaking intervention study, Groark, Muhamedrahimov, Palmov, Nikiforova, and McCall (2005) demonstrated that promoting caregiver sensitivity leads to better socioemotional and cognitive development of the children involved and a better atmosphere in the groups consisting of children of differing ages. 
- Caregiver-child ratio might also be important. Groark and colleagues (2005) managed to decrease the number of children per caregiver, which promoted children’s development significantly.
- Children with the most favorable caregiver-child ratio (maximally three children per caregiver) did not significantly lag behind their peers reared in families. This means that in residential care with small groups intellectual development of the pupils may not lag behind substantially.
- According to a paper on the consequences of early institutionalisation, 
    * Children: caregiver ratios tend to be high, roughly 6–8  to 1, and sometimes higher, even in wards of young infants.
    *  Further, there are many and changing caregivers, some of whom may work long shifts (24 hours) and then are off for three days. This caregiver scheduling, turnover, vacations that may be as high as 50–60 days per year, plus ward transitions mean that children can experience 60–100 different caregivers by the time they are 19 months old (St. Petersburg-USA Orphanage Research Team, 2008). 
    * Finally, and perhaps most importantly, caregiver-child interactions tend to be limited, perfunctory, and business-like with a minimum of warm, sensitive, responsive interactions.

## Poor environments: 
- In less-developed countries the discrepancies between the IQ of residential and family-reared children was indeed largest. 
-  In the latter countries the IQ delays were negligible, perhaps because of the extreme poor living conditions for both categories of children (family reared and orphanage-reared) in those African countries. 
- Wolff (1995) even suggested that in Eritrea children living in orphanages were better off than children reared by their parents.
- Similarly, Kodero (2001) found that AIDS/HIV orphans in Kenya received better care in children’s homes than in other forms of care, including care by the extended family.

## Lack of challenging stimuli:
- The stimulus deprivation theory (Casler, 1961) suggests that the lack of physical and social stimuli of any kind may be the most important cause of intellectual delays, and enriching the orphanage environment would result in better intellectual development.
- Cognitive stimulation may be another important factor in children’s homes. Morison, Chisholm, and Ames (1995) showed that with an increasing amount of play materials, developmental delays decreased in children adopted from orphanages (see also Kaler & Freeman, 1994).

## Lack of stable attachments
- The maternal deprivation concept (Bowlby, 1951) states that a stable and continuous attachment relationship with a sensitive caregiver is essential for socioemotional as well as for intellectual development. 
- If this is true, children’s homes with more sensitive caregivers and smaller groups might be less damaging to intellectual development.

## Age of children and duration of stay:
- Age of the children and the duration of their stay in the orphanage may also play a role in the degree to which gjusroup care affects children’s intellectual development. One would expect that younger entry into the orphanage (Sloutsky, 1997) and a longer stay (Sloutsky, 1997; Spitz, 1945) would be more detrimental, but the evidence is equivocal



# Interventions to improve cognitive development in institutional care

## Six principles for supporting children in care 
- Provide safe environments and rich experiences that stimulate and enrich brain growth.
- Support children and caregivers to understand the link between traumatic events and cognitive difficulties.
- Develop and support positive relationships and connections in children's lives.
- Maintain targeted interventions throughout childhood and adolescence.
- Offer all children in care targeted and trauma-specific interventions.
- Ensure that specific cognitive difficulties are addressed directly.

## Foster Care & Adoption
- [^1]In a randomized control trial the Bucharest Early Intervention Project showed that foster care as an intervention improved the cognitive outcome of children substantially (Nelson et al., 2007).
- The remarkable catch-up shown by adopted children in comparison with their peers who remain behind in institutional care (e.g., Rutter et al., 1998; Van IJzendoorn & Juffer, 2006) cannot for the greater part be ascribed to selection bias
- According to a paper that studied the effects of parental separation[^3], 
	- children who are placed in foster care before 24 months of age are more likely to have secure attachments despite their early time in institutional care 
	* show cognitive development scores in the normal range.
	* at 42 and 54 months old, children who had been placed in foster care showed cognitive gains over their peers who remained in orphanages.
	* Placement in foster care also improves electroencephalogram measures of brain activity, relative to those who remained in institutional care.

## School-Based Interventions:
According to a paper on developmental consequences of parent-child separation[^3], 
**Classroom-based interventions can be feasibly implemented by nonspecialized, trained personnel.** 
- In a sample of left-behind adolescents, a teacher-student relationship positively predicted self-esteem and negatively predicted depression and problem behaviours.
* association between teacher-student relationship and depression was stronger among the left-behind group. 
* In India, a school-based intervention targeted Tibetan adolescents living in exile with limited family contact. This life skills training intervention, carried out with 300 adolescents aged 13–19 years, showed positive social and mental health impacts. This program reduced youth reports of stress related to, school, leisure and the future through various skill-based course topics such as creative thinking, critical thinking, effective communication, empathy, and decision making.
* School-based cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) group intervention in two schools in London for traumatized refugee or asylum-seeking children from countries affected by war. Teachers identified participants based on students’ classroom behaviour and their disclosure of traumatic events. The intervention reduced overall and intrusive PTSD symptoms and increased improvements in behaviour, as indicated by a teacher measure.

## Community-Based Interventions
According to a paper on developmental consequences of parent-child separation[^3], 
**Group interventions may be an effective way to target multiple youths who have experienced loss and separation in a single setting while facilitating social interaction with others facing a similar experience.**
- Utilizing preexisting community and social services and programming might be an effective way to leverage systems that are already in place to reach those separated from a caregiver.

### Children Companion Mothers Program (CCMP)
- The community-based intervention, the Children Companion Mothers Program (CCMP), took place over 3 years. 
- As part of the intervention, each participating village had a physical space for children to attend after-school activities; a paid, full-time program employee providing welfare services and program access to children; and a commitment of local governing institutions and authorities to collaboratively solve issues faced by left-behind children, as identified by the village program employee. 
- Overall, results suggest that this community-level approach may have reduced disparities between left-behind and non-left-behind groups as shown by CCMP participants’ levels on various well-being indicators.
* CCMP participants exhibited higher resilience, safety awareness, and communicative competence as well as better academic performance, guardianship, and physical health habits than participants in the control group, according to self-report measures. 

### Youth Readiness Intervention
- Youth Readiness Intervention, which integrated CBT and interpersonal therapy developed for 15- to 24-year-olds in a randomized controlled trial.
* Program outreach, recruitment, and implementation were done at the community level, and the 10–12 intervention sessions at times involved family and community members as a way to foster engagement and establish a support system.
* improved with regard to emotion regulation and prosocial behaviour, as well as educational engagement, like attendance and enrollment, according to a teacher survey (classroom performance scale) and youth report. 


## St Petersburg USA Orphanage Intervention Research [^5]
### Research structure 
* Each institution was assigned to a different condition: Training plus Structural Changes** (T+SC), **training but no structural changes or Training Only **(TO), **no Intervention or care-as-usual** (NoI). 
* Training: Training consisted of 12–14 sessions (approximately 60 h total) teaching caregivers to interact with children in a more “parent-like” manner by providing more warm, sensitive, and contingently responsive care to children.
* Structural changes: Were designed to create a more “family-like” environment within the institution. These changes were designed to support caregiver–child interactions and relationships, and included reducing the number of caregivers per group, appointing primary caregivers who worked more consistently during the week, reducing group sizes, integrating groups by age and disability status, stopping periodic “graduations” of children to new rooms with new caregivers and peers, appointing a few consistent substitute caregivers for each group, and establishing “family hour” twice daily in which visitors were prohibited and children spent time with their caregivers.

### Success of the intervention
- Specific areas of improvement included physical growth, cognitive and social-emotional development, and attachment quality to caregivers. 
- Behavioral and mental development were assessed with the Battelle Developmental Inventory increased perhaps the largest average increase in behavioral/mental development observed for any intervention in the literature. 
- Children improved more the longer they resided in the intervention institutions, and this was true for children with and without disabilities.
- Children in the intervention institutions also gained more than those in NoI in height, weight, and chest circumference, and they progressively displayed fewer functional limitations; again gains were greater the longer children were in the intervention. 
- In caregiver-child free play sessions, typically developing T +SC and TO children displayed a higher quality of play, alertness, and self-regulation than NoI, and T +SC children showed more positive affect, social initiative, and communication than TO and NoI children – again more the longer they were in the intervention

### Sustaining the success of this intervention
- According to a paper[^7] on the benefits of maintaining a socioemotional intervention in institutional settings, we learn about the different maintenance activities used to continue the initial success of the intervention:
	- The original intervention involved several components thought to promote maintenance. First, the double intervention was implemented in a BH in which the director was thoroughly committed to implementing and maintaining the intervention and insisted that her staff do so.
	- Second, although the intervention project provided substantial resources to this BH including some funds to hire additional caregivers, the intervention was designed to reduce the number of different caregivers in children’s lives but not to increase the number of caregiver hours available to children.
	- Third, a train-the-trainer strategy was adopted so that training personnel were continually available to prepare new caregivers who replaced those who left during and after the intervention
	- Fourth, an in-house monitoring and supervision system was established in which specialists (e.g., staff professionals in children with disabilities, early education) were responsible for monitoring the caregivers and encouraging them to implement the training on the wards on a continuing basis.
	- Furthermore, following the end of the intervention project, additional coaching and technical assistance were provided by author Palmov and two other professionals to both Training + Structural Changes and TO, which consisted of weekly or bimonthly visitations, supervision, and periodic refresher training.

### Larger recommendations from this intervention
* The St. Petersburg intervention demonstrates that institutions do not need to operate in the way most do and that encouraging caregivers to interact more appropriately with children in an environment that is made more family-like can produce very substantial improvements in the development of resident infants and toddlers
*  Interestingly, the DQs of children in all three institutions improved over the six-year period, perhaps because fewer children were sent to institutions but staff levels remained the same producing smaller groups and fewer children per caregiver in all three of the institutions (McCall et al., in press).
* These results and those of similar interventions indicate that institutions can be improved; the improvements can produce substantial increases in physical, mental, social, and behavioral development in both typically developing children and those with disabilities; and such benefits can be maintained for at least six years with no additional funds


### The Bucharest Early Intervention Project (BEIP)
- [^15][[The Bucharest Early Intervention Project]] ( has begun providing a foster care inter-  vention in Bucharest, Romania, in which they  are following the development of children removed from orphanage to foster care and comparing their developmental progress to both children who remain in orphanage and a community comparison group. 
- The study showed that high-quality foster care has the potential of improving children’s development relative to the typical institutional environment

### Study Design
- Children in the BEIP were randomized into either the ‘Care As Usual Group’ (CAUG) (the group who remained in institutional care), or ‘High Quality Foster Care Group’(FCG), and a comparison group of non-institutionally raised children were matched by age and gender

### Study findings
- No biological differences between children who were raised in institutional environments and those in the comparison group who had never been cared for in an institutional environment ,nor with those who had been randomised to high quality foster care.
- Lower IQ scores for both FCG and CAUG as compared to the comparison group.
- Higher levels of callous-unemotional traits among children who experienced any institutional care as opposed to the comparison group. *(Callous-unemotional (CU) traits comprise a temperament dimension characterized by low empathy, interpersonal callousness, restricted affect and a lack of concern for performance.)*
- Children in the FCG were more likely to display adaptive functioning than those in the CAUG (*Adaptive functioning means how well a person handles common demands in life and how independent they are compared to others of a similar age and background)
- Higher psychopathology among those in CAUG and the FCG compared to the comparison group at ages 8, 12, and 16. The FCG had significantly lower psychopathology than the CAUG at age 16. 
- Particularly high rates of attention problems, poor self-regulation, attachment disorders and anxiety are noted among those who experienced institutional care.
- Children who experienced institutional care had reduced cognitive processing speed compared to the comparison group.
- However,both the wealth of evidence from the BEIP (using a strong RCT methodology), and more piece meal evidence from other comparative studies, indicate that children and young people who are either initiallyplaced, or subsequently move to, family based environments are able to match children who were neverremoved from the home, and make up ground on disadvantages they may have experienced uponplacement


## Hodges and Tizard Study
A paper on the impact of institutionalisation on IQ covers this important study that shows that  institutionalized children were not destined for developmental compromise. They studied children who had spent the first 2 years of their lives in high-quality institutions in the United Kingdom (Tizard, 1977).
- In these institutions the child to caregiver ratios were 3:1 and the were taken on outings, and were fed well.
- The major way in which orphanage children’s lives differed from the lives of home-reared children was that caregivers were discouraged from forming intimate relationships with them (Tizard & Tizard, 1971). 
- Tizard and Joseph (1970) first assessed children in the institution when they were 2 years old and compared them to a sample of home-reared children from a working class background. 
- They found that the institution children’s [[IQ]] scores were only slightly lower than those of the working class children and that their language was only slightly delayed. 
- At age 4.5 the mean [IQ](Roll%20Ups/Education/IQ.md) of the children in an institution was in the average range and no language problems were found (Tizard & Rees, 1974). 
- Hodges and Tizard (1989) reported that children adopted from the institution had normal [IQ](Roll%20Ups/Education/IQ.md)s at 8 and 16 years of age. Tizard’s findings were more positive than the findings of the earlier search, but it is important to note that the children in Tizard’s sample had not experienced the extreme deprivation experienced by earlier samples of children  (e.g., Goldfarb, 1945a)

## Using Play to improve Cognition
- According to a paper on the relation of play and congition in institutional care[^13]
	- Play has been related to the development of both cognition and social competence
	- Play involved moving from learning schemes such as grasping or swinging an object, to new schemes involving higher levels of integration through pleasurable, spontaneous, and unorganized repetition and synthesis.
	- Studies describing play and its relationship to development have demonstrated associations with cognition, motor skills, language, sensory processing, socialization, affect, and disposition
	- Children cared for in institutions exhibited less exploratory play, less varied play, and developmentally lower levels of play than their home-reared peers. 
	- Findings suggest that cognitive development, as measured by the standardized BSID-II, is related to play behaviours. 

## Using Physical Exercise to improve Cognition
- According to a paper designed to understand if dance activities can improve cognitive performance, we find out that, 
	- Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown that the evidence for the long-term effects of structured exercise programs on children’s cognitive performance is inconclusive; some studies report positive effects, while others report no effects (see for reviews
	- Nevertheless, it can be concluded that increasing the time spent on exercise in school at the cost of academic lessons does not negatively impact children’s cognitive performance
	- The vast majority of studies that examined the long-term effects of exercise on cognitive performance of children have implemented extensive exercise interventions with durations of 30–60 min per session, mostly delivered three to five times a week. These studies are simply impractical in the context of institutions
	-  A study examined high intensity aerobic exercises or (2) high intensity combined aerobic and strength exercises were implemented three times per week in 14–16 years old adolescents. The exercise bouts were implemented once a week during recess and twice a week as part of the regular physical education (PE) classes. The authors found no significant differences in executive functioning between the intervention groups and the control group that followed the regular PE classes

## Trauma-based interventions
- Children in care are likely to have experienced a complex mix of neglect, trauma and adversity. There is an urgent need to develop tailored interventions for the difficulties faced by these children.
-  In the meantime, all children in care should be offered interventions based on the best current evidence, and that target trauma symptoms and cognitive skills.

### Targeted strategies include:
-   Trauma-Focused CBT 
		- At present, Trauma-Focused CBT is the approach that has most empirical support This trauma-specific intervention has also been shown to improve broad aspects of executive functioning such as cognitive skills and emotional regulation 
		- Therefore, until more tailored interventions are developed for the complex needs of children in care, trauma-specific therapy should be offered as part of the support plan for children who have been exposed to traumatic events
-   Dialectical Behaviour Therapy
-   interventions that focus on the development of specific cognitive skills


## Using Cognitive Therapies to improve cognitive outcomes in children
- According to a meta analysis on the Efficacy of Cognitive Training Programs in Children and Adolescents, 
	- Cognitive therapies are intended to improve basic cognitive functions, whatever the cause of the deficiency may be. Children and adolescents with various cognitive deficits are treated with behavioral therapeutic and computer-supported training programs.
	- Such training programs are used in children with the following disorders:
		-  Disturbances in mental development
		- Severe attention disorders 
		- Acquired cerebral function disorders or brain injury, also status post mild craniocerebral trauma
		-  Cognitive therapy and training programs are most frequently indicated in children with attention deficit disorders or attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADD/ADHD), where the efficacy of solely medicinal treatment has been questioned.

### Evidence-backed outcomes of cognitive therapy 
- Behaviour: The greatest effects were reported in the area of behavior/psychopathology
- Intelligence—The overall effect was slight.
- School performance—Here too, the effects were slight
- These interventions do not treat underlying diseases; rather, they train specific cognitive functions such as attention, memory, and executive functions, with the intention of improving skills at school and in daily life. 
- A meta-analysis showed no overall favorable effects of cognitive training programs on cognitive functions. Favorable effects on behavior were demonstrated but represent nonspecific effects of treatment.
- Clear-cut effects were demonstrated only for individual selected interventions and indications. This underlines the necessity of proper neuropsychological evaluation to identify the patients for whom cognitive training is indicated.


## Successful interventions in institutions include one or many of the following components: 
- According to a meta-analysis that described different interventions in instituional children, these components are seen in successful interventions that improve cognitive performance[^1],  
	- Regular visual and auditory stimulation 
	- Impersonal tactile stimulation
	- Decreased child-caregiver ratio
	- Personal relationship with one caregiver 
	- Increased caregiver stability 
	- Sensitive interaction with children
	- Personal care 
	- Pre-school attendance 
	- Impersonal stimulation of exploration 
	- Cognitive stimulation 
	- Structured play 



# Other factors that affect developmental outcomes
## Time & Timing
*Generally, the earlier and younger that children leave institutional care for stable foster care or adoption, the better it is for their outcomes and trajectory.*

 - According to a meta analysis on interventions to improve development outcomes in children[^1]
	- The timing of the intervention however made a significant difference. Interventions starting before the first birthday of the child were significantly more effective  than interventions starting at a later age. 
	- Effect of interventions decreased with increasing age of the children at the start of the intervention. 
	- Interventions with children younger than 12 months were more effective than interventions starting at a later age. Similar effects have been found for children’s physical growth
- According to a paper on the developmental effects of parental separation[^3], 
	- Length of time in an institution appears to be negatively associated with developmental outcomes.  
	- Cognitive recovery was inversely related to the length of stay in institutional care.
	- prolonged residence in orphanages led to higher neuropsychological deficits in memory, attention, and inhibitory control but similar levels to peers in auditory processing, rule acquisition, and planning
	- At 18 months of age or after, parasympathetic nervous system reactivity was negatively affected into early adolescence (age 12).
	- For children placed at or after 15 months old, expressive language and receptive language were negatively impacted into early childhood but not later.
	- When placed at or after 24 months of age, a child’s IQ, attachment organization, and security were negatively affected into early childhood. 
	- those placed before 30 months of age showed growth in their learning and visual-spatial memory such that they were indistinguishable from other children by age 16.

## Stability in Caregiving
- According to a paper that studies disruptions in caregiving and their effect on development in children[^2],  Aside from group differences in growth, the compromised height and weight growth patterns linked to individual differences in caregiver disruptions in foster care group underscore the importance of a consistent caregiving environment for child well-being.
- Thus, although we did not observe major changes in pubertal development among groups, caregiving disruptions deserve further investigation as a factor that could moderate changes in pubertal tempo in girls and boys.

## Quality of Caregiving
- According to a paper on the St. Petersburg USA Orphanage intervention research, 
	- Caregivers received little training, and most of their training pertained to routine caregiving and basic physical health
	- Caregivers rarely initiated or maintained reciprocal social interactions with children or provided physical affection. Instead, caregivers used directive language and focused on providing the necessities (feeding, changing diapers, bathing) in a business-like manner with little eye contact, talking, or playing. 
	- Thus, although the physical resources were adequate in these institutions, children had few warm, sensitive, and responsive interactions with a few consistent caregivers
- According to a paper that studied the impact of institutionalisation on child development,  In addition to the length of time in an institution, the availability of toys and having been a favorite in the institution were associated with fewer delays and higher scores on the Gesell scales, whereas being described as dirty when first met by parents was associated with more delays and lower Gesell scores

## Miscellaneous factors
*Didnt come across these factors in more detail in these readings. Might have been covered in other roll-ups*

- According to the St Petersburg USA Orphanage Intervention Research Project[^5], other moderating factors include
	- Severity of deprivation
	- Age at assessment 
	- Gender
		- However, according to a paper on the IQ of children growing up in CCIs[^6], Gender did not appear to be a significant moderator; whether the studies included only males or only females did not yield different effect sizes 
	- Nutritional status
	- Home environment
	- Physical Health
	- Disease burden
	

# Typical Developmental Milestones
- According to the Institute for Human Services and the Ohio Child Welfare Training Program[^4], these charts can be used to assess child's milestone achievement and delays. 

## School-aged children

![[School Aged (Physical, Cognitive, Social).png]]


### Warning Signs 
According to Hope Worldwide[^14], here are a few concerns of not meeting these needs at this age
- Where the child does not accomplish the tasks, he may give up hope for the future
- The child might feel inferior (less than his/her peers)
- The child may feel inadequate (not knowing, not being able)

### How active should a 6- to 12-year-old be?
Physical activity guidelines for school-age kids recommend that they get **at least 1 hour** of moderate to strong physical activity daily. In addition:
- Most of the physical activity should be aerobic, where kids use large muscles and continue for a period of time.
- Examples of aerobic activity are running, swimming, and dancing.
- School-age kids usually have brief bouts of moderate to strong physical activity alternating with light activity or rest throughout the day. Any moderate to strong activity counts toward the 60-minute goal.
- Muscle-strengthening and bone-strengthening physical activity should be included at least 3 days a week.
- Children naturally build strong muscles and bones when they run, jump and play. Formal weight programs aren’t needed. However, they are safe when properly designed and supervised.

### Role of caregiver
- According to Hope Worldwide[^14], here are a few practices to support children at this age, 
	- Praise the child’s efforts
	- Encourage the child to see himself/herself as equal to the peers
	- Encourage a sense of being able to achieve even against all problems
	- Teach them how to handle failure and solve problems
	- Caregiver must give appropriate support
- According to the American Psychological Association, these are the tips for caregivers
	- Help your children to develop a sense of competence: give them opportunities to master some skills like cooking, building models, making crafts, playing an instrument.
	- Reinforce the understanding of right and wrong and consequences.
	- Teach problem solving to your child. **Use the IDEAL model** to:
		- Identify the problem and the feelings involved (Your child is being bullied and is afraid of going to school)
		- Determine with the child possible solutions without use of violence.
		- Evaluate with the child the merits of each possible solution.
		- Act, choosing the best solution.
		- Learn from what you and your child did to solve the problem.
		- Use real-life situations (in your family or make-up a situation) and when you are on the bus, in the car or in the kitchen, play the IDEAL game with your child. A mock scenario could be: A child can’t watch TV because he or she hasn’t done homework and she/he is mad and breaks the remote control.
	- Reinforce prosocial skills such as sharing, empathy, cooperation by asking a child to do things like help care for a baby, collect food for a shelter.
	- Provide opportunities for your child to develop an understanding of rules by playing simple table games that rely on chance rather than on skills such as cards, dominoes, tic-tac-toe.
	- Teach by speaking out loud to yourself (so your child will hear) about a problem and how to resolve it. An example: We are out of milk, bread and fruit. I’m not feeling well. I will call daddy and ask him to stop by the grocery store on his way home to get them.
	- Demonstrate that behaviors and actions have consequences for everybody involved in a situation: If you do that, this will happen or when you do this, then you will get this


## Adolescents

![[Adolescents (Emotional).png]]



### Factors associated with resilience and positive outcomes in adolescents

According to child-parenting guidelines in the US, these are the factors that influence outcomes for young adults

#### Stable, positive relationship with at least one caring adult
 Numerous studies have found that the presence of an adult—a parent or someone other than a parent—with a strong positive, emotional attachment to the child is associated with resilience (Garbarino, 1999). This might be a teacher or coach, an extended family member, or a mentor, such as those found in the Big Brothers/Big Sisters Program (Roth & Brooks-Gunn, 2000).

#### Religious and spiritual anchors
A sense of meaning is one of the major pathways through which violent youth find their way to a constructive future, with religious and spiritual institutions and practices being important vehicles for developing a sense of meaning for these youth (Garbarino, 1999).

#### High, realistic academic expectations and adequate support  
Schools that provide students with a sense of shared cooperative responsibility and belonging, convey high expectations for participation, and provide high levels of individual support for students tend to enhance resilience (Siedman et al., in press).

#### Positive home environment
A warm, nurturing parenting style, with both clear limit setting and respect for the growing autonomy of adolescents, appears to be associated with resilience in adolescents 

#### Emotional intelligence and ability to cope with stress  
Although intelligence per se has been reported to be associated with resilience (Fergusson & Lynskey, 1996), the factors that may be more important, because they are more amenable to change and are also involved in resilience, are emotional intelligence and the ability to cope with stress (Garbarino, 1999).


## Role of the caregiver: 
According to Hope Worldwide[^14], here are a few practices to support children at this age, 
- Keep open communication channels
- Encourage the child to speak their mind or express their opinions
- Provide advice and guidance
- Set boundaries with child
- Give the child the opportunity to express his/her anger and other difficult feelings
- Include them in discussions about a variety of topics, issues, and current events.
- Encourage your teen to think independently and develop their own ideas.
- Help your child in setting goals.
- Challenge them to think about possibilities for the future.
- Compliment and praise your teen for well-thought-out decisions.
- Help them in reevaluating poorly made decisions.
- One important way to improve cognitive development for your kids is to regularly expose them to new environments. Don't just stick to your regular routine. Schedule field trips to new places in town, like museums, parks, zoos, aquariums, playgrounds, and more.
- Music is a great tool for helping promote the development of many important cognitive skills. Music as well as memory and word identification, sensory perception, and more.



# Assessment tools [[Assessment Tools]]
- According to a paper that looked at IQ of children growing up in CCIs, 
	- A list of such tests of IQ measurements are:
        * Raven's Matrices
        * WISC
        * Hetzer-Bühler
        * Griffiths
        * Gesell Schedules
        * Bayley Scales
        * Cattell test
        * SON
        * Stanford-Binet
        * Uzgiris-Hunt
        * Gesell/Kuhlmann Merrill-Palmer
        * Denver II test
        * Battelle
        * Minnesota
* According to a paper on assessing quality of care homes[^9], we learn about the 
	    * Family Day Care Rating Scale (FDCRS) and Infant/Toddler Environment Rating Scale (ITERS) by Harms and Clifford (1984), 
	    * the PROFILE by Abbott-Shim and Sibley (1993), the Caregiver Interaction Scale by Arnett (1989), 
	    * the Adult Involvement Scale (AIS) by Howes and Stewart (1987), and the
	    * Observational Record of the Caregiving Environment (ORCE) developed by the NICHD Early Child Care Research Network (1996) are some of the tools in use.
		    * All these tools follow a top-down approach and have a pre-defined rubric that allows to score the child care homes.
- According to a paper that studied the needs of children in institutional care, these are the folowing assessment tools used:
	- To measure sociodemographic characteristics of the children, details from the Health and Human Services Agency's data information system was obtained. It consisted of age, gender, primary language, race/ethnicity, reason for removal, and initial placement type. Seven categories were used to describe reason for removal:
		  - sexual abuse,
		  - physical abuse,
		  - emotional abuse,
		  - child neglect,
		  - caregiver absence,
		  - change of placement,
		  - other, including exploitation (e.g., using a child to beg for money) and out-of-town inquiries (e.g., a child from Mexico living in the San Diego area needing child welfare services).
	- Medical Charts at Polinsky:The physical health and mental health status data were abstracted from these charts.
		- **Physical health** : The body systems section of the medical record grouped potential health problems under the following proscribed categories: dermatologic, respiratory, digestive, ear, eye, endocrine, musculoskeletal, neurological, mental health, cardiac, hematologic, reproductive, urinary, toxic syndromes, in utero exposure, toxic screen results, nonaccidental trauma, birth history, metabolic/ nourishment, systemic infections
	  - **Mental health** : Seven types of mental health disturbances were specified on the standardized intake form in the chart: attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism/ pervasive developmental disorder, depression, oppositional defiant disorder, adjustment disorder, disruptive disorder, and others
-  Denver Developmental Screening Test II (Denver II):
The Denver-II was used to screen all children entering Polinsky for developmental delay. This tool can be used to screen children from birth to 6 years of age and includes 125 items in four sections: Personal-Social, Language, Fine Motor-Adaptive, and Gross Motor. It was used by the DSEP program for three reasons.
- Bayley Scales of Infant Development II (Bayley-II):
The Bayley-II36 was used to evaluate children ages 0 to 42 months on three scales of development: mental, motor, and behavior.
- Stanford-Binet IV (SB-IV):The SB-IV was developed to evaluate cognitive development for ages 2 years through adulthood and measures four areas: verbal reasoning, abstract/visual reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and short-term memory.
