Successful interventions in improving caregiving 
What is the importance of caregiving in influencing child outcomes? 

# Why is caregiving crucial? 
- According to Aangan[^3], The children’s answer to our first question, about the first three things they would like to change about their institution, was clear and unanimous:
	Staff – Child Interaction:
		“The staff does not understand us”, said 70% CICL, 50% CNCP.
		45% said the Probation Officer had “never called us for a discussion or explained things to us.”
		- Disciplinary Issues:
“If there is a problem in the home, caretakers and monitors handle it.
They beat us up”, said 65% CICL, 60% CNCP.
-  Structured Recreation:
 “We wish they would allow us to play more and have more fun,” said
24% CNCP and 19% CICL.

## Effects of Sub-optimal care
In a systematic review[^4]- Children may develop a low-quality attachment bond or even lack an attachment relationship altogether in the absence of adequate care

- Taken together with the experience of violence and abuse, this lack may impact the child’s stress response system, and, in this way, the development and structure of the brain as well. These changes to neurodevelopment may lead to mental health problems, such as depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and internalizing and externalizing problems

- individuals with a history of early institutional care showed more academic difficulties and deficits in social skills, such as maintaining trustful interpersonal relationships (Frank, Klass, Earls, &amp; Eisenberg, 1996; Merz, McCall, &amp; Wright, 2013).

- child maltreatment has been related to epigenetic changes in the stress response axis (Hecker, Radtke, Hermenau, Papassotiropoulos, &amp; Elbert, 2016; McGowan et al., 2009)

- Usually, the child care institutions are able to offer basic provisions of food and shelter, but they lack adequate means to offer sensitive, child-oriented care, possibly leading to the emotional and physical neglect of many children (Oliveira et al., 2012; Vashchenko et al., 2010)

- the reported worldwide rates of violence against children in institutional care were 6 times higher than those of children living in family-based foster care of interventions to improve care practices in institutions, the paper described the major negative effects of poor caregiving:
- Children may develop a low-quality attachment bond or even lack an attachment relationship altogether in the absence of adequate care
- Taken together with the experience of violence and abuse, this lack may impact the child’s stress response system, and, in this way, the development and structure of the brain as well. These changes to neurodevelopment may lead to mental health problems, such as depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and internalizing and externalizing problems

-  Playing equipment for children. (57%)
-  Motivation: Higher salaries; more holidays; acknowledgement from and
accessibility to authorities (31%)
-  Security systems (to reduce cases of running away). (31%)
-  Institutional Budget - increase and timely disbursement. (17%)
-  1 Infrastructure (building renovations, improvement etc) . (4.9%)

-  Staff motivation :

		- Ensure that innovative ideas, individuals and institutions are identified and reinforced
# Recommendation III : Operational definition of effectiveness
-  Need to define effectiveness of institutions factoring in staff, children's and governing authorities perspectives
			- Standardized Evaluation of performance,criteria &systems. 
			- Standardize monitoring tool combining criteria related to infrastructure,interaction and activity . 
			- External Evaluation through Vigilance Committees. 
			- Develop self monitoring tool.

[^1]According to a paper authored by the Duke Global Health Institute on psychosocial wellbeing of CNCP in institutional settings, the ideal outcome for the **Caregiving**  factor was for the child to have at least one adult (age 18 or over) who provides consistent care, attention, and support. 
- Caregiving was “seen as good when there is an identified adult (parent or guardian) who provides the child with a stable, nurturing, and emotionally secure environment. The relationship between the child and the caregiver should provide physical and psychological security for the child. 
- This factor captured how committed the caregiver was to the child and to his/her involvement with the child”.
