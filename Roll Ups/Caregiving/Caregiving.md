[^1]CSI factor 4: Caregiving. The goal of this factor was for the child to have at least one adult (age 18 or over) who provides consistent care, attention, and support. Caregiving was “seen as good when there is an identified adult (parent or guardian) who provides the child with a stable, nurturing, and emotionally secure environment. The relationship between the child and the caregiver should provide physical and psychological security for the child. This factor captured how committed the caregiver was to the child and to his/her involvement with the child”.
