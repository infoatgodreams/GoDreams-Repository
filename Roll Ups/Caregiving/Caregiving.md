# Why is caregiving crucial? 
## Children's perspectives
- According to Aangan[^3], The children’s answer to our first question, about the first three things they would like to change about their institution, was clear and unanimous:
	- **Staff – Child Interaction**
		- “The staff does not understand us”, said 70% CICL, 50% CNCP.
		- 45% said the Probation Officer had “never called us for a discussion or explained things to us.”
	- **Disciplinary Issues**
		- “If there is a problem in the home, caretakers and monitors handle it
		- They beat us up”, said 65% CICL, 60% CNCP.
	- **Structured Recreation:**
		 - “We wish they would allow us to play more and have more fun,” said 24% CNCP and 19% CICL.

## Effects of Sub-optimal care

### Physical and Physiological consequences
- [^4]The **psychosocial short stature hypothesis or psychosocial dwarfism syndrome** stipulates that infrequent and inadequate caregiver–child social–emotional interactions contribute to poor physical growth; and when caregiver–child interactions are improved in an institution, children’s physical development improves even without changes in nutrition 
- Also, institutionalized children’s ratios of weight-to-height are typically not nearly as low as their heights and weights, a fact suggesting that their short stature is less associated with malnutrition than quality of caregiver–child interactions. 
- Usually, the child care institutions are able to offer basic provisions of food and shelter, but they lack adequate means to offer **sensitive, child-oriented care,** possibly leading to the **emotional and physical neglect** of many children.
- the reported worldwide rates of **violence** against children in institutional care were **6 times higher** than those of children living in family-based foster care of interventions to improve care practices in institutions, the paper described the major negative effects of poor caregiving

### Behavioural consequences:
- According to a review paper on the impact of institutionalisation[^12], The lack of caregiver–child interactions, talking, and one-on-one contingent responsiveness also contribute to the child’s general behavioral and mental deficiencies.
- **Attachment issues**
	- Consistent with attachment theory, institutionalized children have much higher rates of insecure and **disorganized attachments** even to their favorite caregiver or the one who knows the child best. *Disorganized attachment is characterized by “fear without solution” in which the infant both seeks comfort from the caregiver but is also afraid of the caregiver.*
	- Across studies of institutionalized infants and toddlers, approximately 73% displayed disorganized attachment or were unscoreable, whereas this might be expected in only approximately 15% of low-risk, noninstitutionalized, parent-reared children  
	- Among parent-reared children disorganized attachment predicts a variety of behavior and psychiatric problems in childhood and adolescence. 
	- In a systematic review on institutional childcare, it was shown that[^4]Children may develop a low-quality attachment bond or even lack an attachment relationship altogether in the absence of adequate care. 
	- **Indiscriminate friendliness
		- In a review paper on the impact of institutionalization on children[^12], it was shown that **indiscriminate friendliness** as behavior is common, *that is affectionate and friendly toward all adults (including strangers) without the fear or caution that is typical in young children*. In these cases the children’s behavior toward a stranger cannot be discriminated from their behavior toward their primary caregivers. 
		- found that indiscriminate friendliness was still present in adolescents who had been institutionalized as children but who were later fostered to unstable foster care placements.
		- Researchers have  consistently found associations between orphanage children’s **indiscriminate friendliness and their behavior problems**
		- Chisholm (1998) has suggested that indiscriminate friendliness may serve an adaptive function in the context of the orphanage environment where emotional  resources are extremely limited. 


### Cognitive & mental development consequences:
- [^12]Taken together with the experience of violence and abuse, this lack may impact the **child’s stress response system**, and, in this way, the development and structure of the brain as well. These changes to neurodevelopment may lead to **mental health problems**, such as depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and internalizing and externalizing problems
- individuals with a history of early institutional care showed more **academic difficulties and deficits in social skills**, such as maintaining trustful interpersonal relationships
- Caregiver–child interactions are typically limited to routine caregiving chores (feeding, bathing, changing), conducted in a **perfunctory and business-like manner** with limited social interaction; crying is left unattended; and caregivers do not play with children or provide them with warm, sensitive, contingently responsive, and one-on-one interactions. There is limited reciprocal verbal or nonverbal caregiver– child “conversation.”

## Positive effects of good-quality care
- [^4]**Structural interventions and caregiver trainings** contribute to an improvement in children's living conditions in institutional care
- Training of caregivers and structural changes have beneficial effects on the children's development
- In a seminar on institutional care[^9], we learned that among the positive aspects, the **love and care** that the staff showed to the children was the first point mentioned, together with thefacilities available and good education
- [^4]The findings are in concordance with our hypothesis that **caregiver trainings, structural changes, and enriched caregiving environments** in child care institutions have beneficial effects on the child’s emotional, social, and cognitive development.
- Numerous studies providing institutionalized children with specific sensory and perceptual stimulation plus interventions that deliberately increase the social and educational quality of caregiver–child interactions have led to substantially improved children’s general behavioral and mental development
- Children’s improvements are greater the more comprehensive and intensive the social-emotional and caregiver– child interaction intervention. When the institutional environment was structurally **made more family like** and caregivers provided **better socialemotional interactions** with children, children’s physical and behavioral/mental development improved very substantially (including for children with disabilities), fewer children displayed disorganized attachment, and atypical behaviors were reduced


# Caregiving Interventions
In this section, we'll focus on caregiving interventions that have been tried and tested in institutional settings. 
- According to a review on caregiving interventions[^4], Many of the intervention approaches included in the studies of the present review have some important components in common: They all aim at improving the caregiver–child relationship (attachment and bonding), enriching the caregiving environment through additional stimulation and quality time, and at least some focus on preventing maltreatment and further harm

### Fairstart Global Caregiving Manual
- One promising approach that is theory based and manualized is [[FairstartGlobal]] (www.fairstartglobal.com). It is a curriculum rooted in **attachment theory that promotes appropriate caregiver–child interactions and relationships**. 
	- Its unique benefits include free availability on the Internet, implementation flexibility, administrator and staff involvement in creating its implementation, translation into 26 languages, and current implementation in numerous countries around the globe 

### The Bucharest Early Intervention Project (BEIP)
- [[The Bucharest Early Intervention Project]] ( has begun providing a foster care inter-  vention in Bucharest, Romania, in which they  are following the development of children removed from orphanage to foster care and comparing their developmental progress to both children who remain in orphanage and a community comparison group. 
- The study showed that high-quality foster care has the potential of improving children’s development relative to the typical institutional environment

#### Limitations of the BEIP
-  It is uncertain whether most developing countries could or would implement for most children such an ideal and likely costly foster care system in a reasonable period of time
- Indeed children who were transitioned to government foster care gained less developmentally than those who remained in the ideal foster care, although the number of children involved was small
- Further, no one knows how beneficial the ideal foster care would be if it were compared to an ideal institution. 

### The St. Petersburg- USA Orphanage Project
 - [[The St. Petersburg– U.S.A. Orphanage Project]] , operating in three baby homes in St. Petersburg, is providing different interventions to examine which are most effective in reducing the developmental impact of institutional rearing. 
		- In one baby home, orphanage staff are being trained in child development  and sensitive responsiveness. 
		- In a second,  both caregiver training and structural changes  that reduce the number of different caregivers  and increase their stability in the lives of the children are being implemented. 
		- A third baby  home is serving as a “no intervention” comparison group 
### Interventions implemented in this project
- Training (‘Love these children’)
		- Be engaged with children
		- Encourage warm, sensitive, contingently-responsive caregiver-child interactions
		- Follow child’s lead
		-  Engage in reciprocal verbal and non-verbal interactions and conversation
		- Display appropriate affect 
- Structural changes (More ‘family-like’ environment)
		- Reduce group size from 12–14 to 6–7 children
		- Reduce number of caregivers assigned to a group from 9–12 to 6 
		- Assign 2 ‘primary’ caregivers per group, one of whom would be present most waking hours every day; assign 4 ‘secondary’ caregivers to each specific group who worked separate days
		- Integrate groups by age and disability status of children
		- Stop periodic transitions of children to new groups of peers and caregivers
		- Institute ‘family-hours’ once each in the morning and afternoon in which children remained in their group with their caregivers without visitors or specialists
		- Implement an in-house system of monitoring and supervision to encourage caregivers to implement training principles with children
- Insights:
	- Children developed substantially better in the improved institution. This study shows that institutions can be improved with benefits to children. 
	- Further, the intervention was implemented with regular caregiving staff in a manner that could be subsequently maintained on the regular government-supplied budget with similar benefits for children, which in fact was accomplished 

### Irvington House Study
- Contrary to typical settings, - Irvington House[^6], a home for 130 children,  considered trying to imitate some sort of family life, but quickly came to realize that this was not only impractical but probably undesirable and dishonest as well. 
	- We have therefore been quite clear with ourselves and we hope with the children, that Irvington house is a house and not a home. That counselors are counselors and not parents, and that the other children in the dormitory are members of a group, not of a family. 

### Positive Outcomes for Orphanges (Duke)
- The second study (Whetten et al., 2009, 2014) found the development of children 6–12 years of age in community-created and operated residential care facilities to be as good or better than children raised in family alternatives in the community. 
- This was a study of care as currently practiced, and the countries, communities, and families were sampled in a way to be representative of these environments. 
- This study demonstrated that not every family is better than any institution, but it says nothing about what those family care environments or the residential care facilities could be if they were financially and professionally supported to improve their quality of care.

### Implications of these caregiving interventions: 
- Collectively, these and other studies suggest that in practice the quality of care may be more important for children’s outcomes than the type of care. 
- Family care inherently seems to have many structural features that would support children’s development, but the quality of the caregiver–child interactions, family social-economic status, and how the child is treated within a family can make a great deal of difference. 
- Conversely, institutions do not have to operate in the way many currently do; they could be more family like in both structure and caregiver–child interactions, although they cost more than family care

# Broad recommendations for caregiving from research
A systematic review of caregiving interventions[^4] recommended the need for
	- Broad, theory based approaches are needed and should be tested using **rigorous scientific standards**
	- More efforts are needed to focus on the improvement of **general caregiving environment, caregiver child relationship and maltreatment prevention**
	- **Responsive non-violent caregiver-child interactions** are crucial to children's physical and behavioral develpmnet
	- Beyond improving caregiver-child attachment, caregiver trainings should also focus on **prevention of violence and abuse** in institutional care
	- Improving the quality of care may be more important than the type of care (eg. institutional care vs foster care)
	- Our findings have shown that less than one third of the intervention approaches were theory based, and only three studies applied manualized interventions. Therefore, we advocate for developing theory-based and manualized training concepts for institutional caregivers that may be based on attachment and that can be tested using rigorous scientific standards. 
- Changing institutions that have operated traditionally for decades can be challenging, but it can be done. Caregivers need periodic training in behaviors known to enhance caregiver–child relationships, such as mutual engagement, following a child’s lead, displaying appropriate adult affect, and having reciprocal conversations with children
- But training alone is not sufficient; it must be accompanied by **on-the-ward coaching and structural/operational changes** that reduce group sizes and provide children with fewer and more consistent caregivers over time. 


# Who are the caregivers? 

## Caregiver Profile
- [^2]The Miracle Foundation Method requires for hiring of a qualified social worker at Anwesha.
	- The social worker engaged in counselling of the children, guiding the house parents,observing and supervising the work of the coaching teachers, following up ontraining of children and house parents and documentation-related work.
- In dealing with children who are victims of violence[^8], it's recommended that
	- The Home shall appoint staff only after adequate screening about the past record of the staff, ensuring that the staff has not shown
		-  any particular behavior in the past that could be a pot ent source of danger e .g. psychiatric disorders causing violence or self destructive behavior,
		- is not suffering from substance addiction/ habit (including tobacco and alcohol)
		- exhibits abusive behavior, offending or criminal behavior, etc. 
		- Full care shall be taken not to appoint any person habituated to dangerous drugs.
- In a seminar organized by Udayan Care on institutionalization[^9], - In general it is advisable that caregivers are not too old and the generational gap among them and the children reﬂects that between children and parents.
- At Irvington House[^9], a strict staff selection criterion was used, 
	- The child-care staff is for the most part college-trained. The average age is 24.
	- We are particularly concerned to find people interested in and responsive to professional supervision
	- The child-care workers are directly supervised by trained group workers, with individual conferences as the main supervisory tool 
	- We look for people interested in eventually undertaking graduate training in social work or a related field and who will be, consequently, professionally as well as personally motivated. 
- According to Udayan Care[^11], 
	- Those associated with CCIs should not be convicted persons or those involved in immoral act, child abuse, employment of child labour, moral turpitude or should hold any political office during his/her tenure 
	- No one should be appointed or work in CCIs without police verification. 
		

## Caregiver Strength & Roles
- At Irvington House[^9], a strict staff selection criterion was used, 
	- As a matter of policy, we always have had at least one male worker assigned to the three older groups
	- We have tried consciously to keep the number of different adults with whom a child must have a meaningful relationship to a minimum
	- A child-care worker once assigned to a given dormitory, has remained there throughout his employment at the house. 
	- Each worker has a case load of approximately 20 children. 
- According to guidelines for institutional care in Ethiopia[^5], The profile of the human-power shall be:
    * Manager / Administrator: The manager / administrator shall have at least his/her first degree in sociology, psychology, or other related fields of study with, at least, two years of relevant experience.
    * Secretary: The Secretary shall, at least, have a diploma in office management, accounting or other related fields with, at least, two years of experience in similar line of work.
    * Finance Officer: The Finance officer shall, at least, have a diploma in accounting or other related fields with a minimum experience of two years in the area.
    * Purchaser:The Purchaser shall, at least, have a diploma in material management or other related fields with a minimum experience of two years in the area.
    * Storekeeper: The Storekeeper shall, at least, complete grade twelve with a minimum experience of two years in the area.
    * Cashier: The Cashier shall, at least, have a diploma in accounting or other related fields with a minimum experience of two years in the area.
    * Sanitary and Guards: Sanitary and guards should complete at least grade six with a minimum experience of two years in the area.
    * Health assistant: A Health Assistant shall, at least, have a certificate with a minimum experience of two years in the area.
    * Counselor: A Counselor shall, at least, have his/her first degree in psychology with a minimum experience of two years in the area.
    * Home Mothers: A Home Mother should complete at least grade six and shall have at least a three months relevant training and a minimum experience of one year as an assistant home mother.
- [^11]Udayan care recommends
	- person-in-charge, 
	- probation officer/CWO/CW, 
	- counselor/psychologist/mental health expert, 
	- house mother/house father, 
	- para-medical staff/staff nurse/nursing orderly 
	- storekeeper-cum-accountant; 
	- educator/tutor, medical officer, art & craft & activity teacher and PT instructor-cum-yoga teacher psychiatrist may be hired as part-time staff. 
	- Only female person-in-charge and staff to be appointed for CCIs housing girls 
	- CCIs housing infants should hire ayahs and paramedical staff as per need. (Page 26)


## Caregiver Training
- [^2]According to Miracle Foundation's approach, Anwesha underwent a complete training in areas of supporting
	- family culture
	- rights of the child
	- attachment
	- discipline techniques
	- child development
	- health care – preventative & curative
	- gender roles
	- sexual abuse and prevention
	- communication skills
	- conflict resolution
	- stress management.
	- [^9]Cultural, social, gender and religious sensitisation should also be assured. 
- According to a seminar on mental health in institutional care, caregivers need to be trained in Participatory Action Research
	- The Participatory Action Research (PAR) was a six month study involving researchers, caretakers, administrators, and children. The aim was to deﬁne an **Appropriate Technique and an Efﬁcient Management Strategy** in the care of children with behavioural difﬁculties. 
	- PAR has three essential ingredients:
		- Developing Self-understanding
		- Paying Attention to Insights
		- Respecting the other and Reciprocity
	- To be able to do PAR effectively, basic communication skills are also important. 
	- Listening to understand is the most important communication skill that we often miss. 
	- Through PAR, caregivers find a more meaningful way to express themselves, while working with children with difficulties 


## Caregiver mindset

- There are some very helpful attitudes for a Participatory Approach that we could take from Carl Rogers, the founder of Humanistic Psychology:
	- Empathy or Accurate Understanding;
	- Non-Judgemental Attitude or Unconditional Positive Regard
	- Genuineness or truthfulness.

## Assessing efficiency of caregiving
- According to Aangan[^3], we need to define effectiveness of institutions factoring in staff, children's and governing authorities perspectives. This includes
	- Standardized Evaluation of performance,criteria & systems.
	- Standardize monitoring tool combining criteria related to infrastructure,interaction and activity
	- External Evaluation through Vigilance Committees. 
	- Develop self monitoring tool.  
	- Capacity building of staff to use tool for internal monitoring and goal setting 

## Caring for the Caregiver
- According to Aangan's manual on caregiving[^3], these were the top concerns of the staff at CCIs
	- Playing equipment for children. (57%)
	- Motivation: Higher salaries; more holidays; acknowledgement from and accessibility to authorities (31%)
	- Security systems (to reduce cases of running away). (31%)
	- Institutional Budget - increase and timely disbursement. (17%)
	- Infrastructure (building renovations, improvement etc) . (4.9%)
- [^2]At Miracle Foundation, **‘Tea time with house parents’,** the practice of Miracle staff spending informal timewith caregivers enabled them to unwind, open up, share their joys and concerns and feel acknowledged as being important.
- [^2]Miracle Staff also write regularly in the House parent Diary that served to be a readyreference of their important tasks and responsibilities.
- Prerna[^7] recommends self care tips for all caregivers:
	- Get 8 hours of sleep.
	* Drink adequate water and make sure you are eating healthy meals.
	* Be self compassionate: You are also going through a difficult time, it's okay to struggle
	* Know your limitations: In the pandemic situation, we have limited resources to help ourselves and others, acknowledging this would help caregivers to feel less exhausted and guilty.
	* Regularly engage in coping strategies: Deep Breathing, Exercising, Practicing a hobby, taking regular breaks, self-care activities, using humor in day to day life, Affirmations, Systematic Body relaxation, grounding, Mandala making etc.
	* Stay in contact with loved ones.
* [^9]Aangan recommends certain practices to focus on improving staff morale and motivation
	* **Standardized motivation and Reinforcement Program.** Develop a state level recognition award system based on identifying best practices
	* **Standardized discipline code** for offences by staff
	* Ensure that **innovative ideas, individuals and institutions** are identified and reinforced



# Working with Children

## Key principles governing interactions with children
### Individualization
- According to the study conducted at Irvington House[^6],
	- For young children a paramount need is to feel that there is someone who really cares for him or her as an individual human being, someone with whom and for whom he is special. 
	- In addition to this special one to one relationship, the child must also feel that all, or most, of the people around him like and respect him for what he is. We have called this basic concept, along with the child-care practices that have grown out of it, "**individualization**"
	- We assumed that small children need relatively small, self-contained settings for their basic physical care. They need the **opportunity for privacy, some belongings which are their very own,** some which are to be shared and the freedom to explore within boundaries that set unobtrusive but firm limits on impulse. 
	- The one-to-one relationship thus developed between counselor and child is to give the child a feeling that, despite some of the necessary impersonality and antiseptic quality of an institutional environment, someone on the staff cares for him or her as an individual human being above and beyond the requirements of the job. 

### Positive Caregiving
- A final assumption in relation to the program offered is that any positive life experience, no matter what its duration, strengthens the child in terms of meeting subsequent life experiences. 
- There is no concept of "spoiling the children" as while it is morally and professionally impossibly to not provide the maximum of what we have, our assumption is that if we offer this, a child is better equipped to meet the vicissitudes of whatever his life may be when he leaves us. 

### Lack of Bias & Discrimination
- In a seminar organized by Udayan Care on Institutionalization[^9], it was noted that
	-  especially in residential institutions funded by religious bodies or in governmental institutions of countries withlittle concern for the beliefs of minorities, children’s right to equality and non-discrimination could be seriouslyneglected. 
	- All children placed in institutions should have opportunities to express their opinions, practice theirreligion, function in their native language and participate in social activities in the community they belong to.Children’s right to equality and non-discrimination should be always upheld. 
- According to Irvington House, caregiver should act as a professional and not as a friend to the child, there by reducing the possibility of a conflict of interest or inappropriate conduct.

### Consistency in caregiving
- [^9]According to a paper that studied caregiving interventions, we need to avoid instability and inconsistency of caregiving, especially for infants and toddlers.
- If children, especially infants and toddlers, do not have a few, stable, consistent caregivers but rather many and changing staff caregivers, adding a constantly changing set of volunteers may compound this problem despite the stimulation they may provide the children.
- If the groups are small, children are cared for by a few stable caregivers, and children remain with those caregivers over long periods of their early lives, short-term volunteers may not be so detrimental, especially for older children. The latter case resembles a stable family environment with many grandparents, aunts and uncles, neighbors, and friends who visit occasionally. One study found children in the latter kind of environment were more developmentally advanced than children in more typical institutions without volunteers
- [^1]According to a paper authored by the Duke Global Health Institute on psychosocial wellbeing of CNCP in institutional settings, the ideal outcome for the **Caregiving**  factor was for the child to have at least one adult (age 18 or over) who provides consistent care, attention, and support. 
	- Caregiving was “seen as good when there is an identified adult (parent or guardian) who provides the child with a stable, nurturing, and emotionally secure environment. The relationship between the child and the caregiver should provide physical and psychological security for the child. 
	- This factor captured how committed the caregiver was to the child and to his/her involvement with the child”.
- As recommended by Aangan[^3], we need to set 
	- Standardized interaction guidelines 
	- Standardized discipline code  
	- Role definition: Interaction responsibilities assigned to key staff
	- Capacity building of staff to use reception material prepared for children to make children feel reassured, informed, safe.

## Disciplining Children
- According to Aangan[^3], Children are helped to develop socially acceptable behaviour by encouraging and reinforcing acceptable behaviour and a constructive staff response to inappropriate behaviour. 
	- Verbal reprimands and redirection- let child know what's unacceptable and why
	- Apologies and Contracts : Take responsibility for actions, assign consequences and ways to make amends
	- Detention after school/during TV/recreation time
	- Written reports and assignments- preferably connected to the incident 
	- Open Circles and Child Panchayats- to encourage peer mediation and group discussion
	- Make a note in the child's file that can later be brought up with CWC/JWB
	- Community services and restitution
	- Time out: separate the child from the group to remove any positive reinforcement/attention for poor actions
	- Withholding privileges- effective, especially for older children. Children need to learn that privileges come with responsibility and that they can be taken away 
		- For serious disciplinary issues like drug abuse, you can use a combination of different methods. 
	- Effective caregiving is a combination of setting boundaries and structures and providing autonomy.
- Children may not conform to all the rules and the staff can decide what are acceptable.
- Extreme disciplining may lead to defiance in children.
- Encourage children to ask questions about rules and have a discussion with them on why certain rules are important. By teaching children to be blindly compliant, we are discouraging critical thinking, which is a valuable characteristic. This not only hampers critical thinking but teaches them that adults are always right which is untrue.
- While working with adolescents recognize that they are developing ideas that might differ from your own. Unless these ideas place the adolescent in danger of harm to self or others, accept their beliefs as an example of their developing individuality.
- Don’t deny children participation in activities, events they were looking forward to attend as a punishment for breaking rules unless the same was announced beforehand.


## Thumb rules for working with children 
- Praise is effective- praise responsible, considerate, appropriate behaviour with attention, thanks, recognition, special privileges 
- Make the child take responsibility - ask them to think about what they could do differently that could work better and be more constructive
- Talk in private- do not humiliate the child in front of others, move to a private spot for more serious issues 
- Two way communication- Listen as well as talk; let the child explain their side 
- Stay calm and firm- never mean
- Redirect alternatives and options 
- Individualise measures- measures should take into account the age, understanding, incident and individual needs of the chilld

## Working with children sensitively
- Whenever a child is seen engaging in unacceptable behavior or is found doing something that is unacceptable, the child should be first asked what he/she was up to. Listen to children. After knowing what the child was doing, an adult can explain why a behavior is inappropriate.
- It is normal for children especially in the adolescent age group to explore their sexuality. The caregivers need to accept and deal with dignity when a child identifies himself/ herself/themselves as gay, lesbian, bisexual or other sexual orientation.
- In order to avoid shaming, embarrassing or humiliating the child, the caregivers should hold this conversation one- on-one with the child and avoid confronting the child in front of the other children.
- Talk about inappropriate behavior without demeaning their self worth or attacking their personality or character.
- When correcting behavior, provide a calm explanation for your preferences.Giving a reason helps children understand the implications of their behavior for others (e.g., if your child teases another child because they wear glasses, explain that wearing glasses helps the child to see better and remind them that teasing can hurt others feelings).
- Tell the child what you do want them to do rather than what you don’t. For example, instead of saying ‘Don’t walk so close to the road’, say ‘Come and walk next to me’. Often, we remember to reprimand children for their mistakes and correct them but forget to appreciate them for achievements and healthy behavior. A simple ‘you did a very good job today!’ can help children feel good about themselves and reinforce healthy behavior.
- Do not verbally or physically abuse children. This hurts them and teaches them that abuse is a problem-solving technique, which they are bound to use to solve their own problems.
- Take abuse between children seriously as well and teach them alternate ways to solve problems.
- Avoid impatient body language like eye rolling, foot tapping or sighing. This can discourage a child from talking.
- Hold conversations at the appropriate time and place. It is also important to address an issue in a timely manner. If one waits too long to address a situation, sometimes the child will not remember the incident or more often than not, it will not register that they did something wrong or unacceptable, thereby causing them to repeat the behavior.
- Refrain from labeling children negatively (for eg: manda, aalsi, moti, sukdi, bewakoof). All labels related to looks, intellect and behavior should be avoided.
- If you see a child lying, you can talk about the situation and address the lying instead of labeling the child as “liar” r “chor/stealer”
- Apologize to children when you make mistakes.This helps children understand that everybody makes mistakes and that mistakes can be rectified. Children often learn through modeling – by observing other individuals and imitating them.
- When children ask questions, you do not have to know all the answers. Admit it when you do not know something.
	- This helps children learn that it is okay to not know everything and that new knowledge can always be acquired through effort.Use conversation as an opportunity to keep up with adolescent activities and relationships. Stay interested, and gently ask questions and seek explanations for their behaviour.
- Praise their efforts, not just their results. A child needs to know that it is okay to fail
- When the child returns from school, college or any vocational training centre make a point to ask how was his/her day in school/college/ vocational training centre.
- Ensure that you maintain confidentiality when children trust you with their stories. This builds trust and helps them accept you as a safe space they can come to when they need adult help.

## In case the child discloses anything threatening or about an abuse:
- Acknowledge that the child is being courageous in sharing a difficult experience or information
- Validate that their decision to trust and share with you was a good, safe and responsible one
- Reassure the child that specific steps will be taken to protect them and other children or adults affected by the event/experience
- If possible identify the next steps that the caregivers will be taking to ensure the safety of the child and others affected
- Follow-up and check-in with the child with regards to feelings of fear, shame, anxiety, relief that they may be experiencing following disclosure
- Ensure that consistent messages are given to the child. Hence, it is important for caregivers to regularly communicate with each other.
- Address children with their names, even in your internal communication and not as POCSO Case, Missing child, ITPA case, Trafficking case, Suicide case, etc.


## Dealing with Emotions
- The best way to work with children is to be empathetic towards them.
- Children can quickly understand who understands them and who cannot understand them. When a child has a fight and is angry with everyone, caregiver could go near and ask permission to sit nearby. The caregiver could say that “I can understand that you are angry and do you want to talk about it?”
- As an adult living with children, express your emotions on the child’s behavior. Only being patient is not the way to deal with children experiencing emotional and behavioral challenges.
- Having conversations about others feelings is required too as it helps the child build skills for empathy and considering different perspectives. Let them know that the staff is human too and not just an authoritarian figure.
- Use the language of “anger expression” (appropriate and inappropriate) instead of anger management or “controlling anger”. Do not seek tips for “controlling” child’s anger
- Anger may have been a useful emotion for children who were abused as that emotion made them protect themselves and realize that they don’t feel safe.
- When children are distressed or aggressive, help them to calm down and then try to have a conversation.When children are triggered (having a strong emotional and physical reaction) they do not have access to the part of the brain that helps them think rationally.\
- Therefore, it is important and will be more effective if caregivers help the child stabilize emotionally by using a range of tools such as grounding or relaxation exercises before disciplining, discussing behavior corrective measures. After the child has calmed down, the staff/parent should have a conversation with the child about what made him/her angry. It is not helpful if you ask children not to be angry. Anger is an emotion and an adult can teach the child to express it healthily. Address the anger and tell the child to express it in words.
- If the child does not have a dialogue about the anger, it will lead to bottling up of the anger and resentment towards the adult causing defiance to follow anything that is told to the child.
- When a staff realizes that the child is going to be aggressive and say bad things about the staff’s character, the staff can tell her/him to think about what s/he actually feels and write it down in a letter rather than trying to hurt the staff by saying nasty things. It may help to acknowledge the impact the child’s words are having in a manner that does not place the responsibility on the child, for example, “I can see that you are angry and hurting. The words that you are saying are hurting me and making me angry/frustrated as well. I don’t think we can have a helpful conversation when we are both so upset.”
- Teach the child the difference between response and reaction. For example: child says to the staff “I don’t want to study”. 
- Reaction: You never like studying, you only want to play all the time.
	- Response: Can you tell me why you don’t want to study? It is not always fun to study especially when we have to study something we don’t enjoy or is challenging. Sometimes we have to do things that are hard so that we can keep learning and growing. What is it that is making it hard for you to study today? Let’s talk about it.
- Sexual abuse in the past may cause sexual dysfunction or excessive sexual acting out. Let the child seek help from a counselor in such cases. Finding the child while engaging in sexually reactive behavior should not be used as a reason for punishment or scolding.

## Dealing with Attachment
- Encourage parent(s)/guardian(s)to meet the children as much as they can. it helps the child to build trust and reduces the attachment issues they face which reflect on their behavior.
- In early childhood it also helps in the brain development of the child. 
- Model empathy and compassion in your engagements with children and recognize and encourage empathy and acts of kindness among children that will make them live together in harmony.



# Care Practices
- In dealing with children who are victims of violence[^8], it is recommended that the safety/risk assessment in relation to victims' known and likely activities, the potential for bullying and abuse within and outside of the Home and where applicable the impact of emergency admissions on the victims shall also be carried out, recorded in writing and regularly reviewed by the organization running the Home in consultation with subject matter experts.
- The shelter home authority shall evolve a Crisis Management Plan (CMP) to address a range of foreseeable crises (e.g. death, outbreaks of illness, fires, serious allegations or complaints, significant accidents, staff shortage, and control problems within or outside the home).

- [^9]At a seminar on mental health in institutions, Dr. Sen advise
	- d towards a major consideration of the roles of caregivers when applying certain changes to the everyday management of the institution, especially because, in terms of mental health care, a comprehensive approach, where the caregivers, the managers and the psychologists and psychiatrists work together, is needed.Hierarchy among personnel is often significant and not carefully evaluated, which seriously affects the functioning of institutions. 
	- At the sametime, it is imperative for caregivers to know how to prepare the children in case they are leaving the institution for a different job, instead of disappearing and suddenly leaving them alone. 
		- Caregivers should be as constant as possible and, when about to leave their jobs for any reason, they should know how toprepare the children to de-attach.
	- Most service providers ask the children to repeatedly narrate their stories, putting them through undeniable pain. In the worst cases, children are blamed for their negative experiences, or get further maltreated
	- practitioners, to ensure that children do not suffer additional victimisation through adverse labelling.
	- A couple of the participants mentioned that the staff  of the institutions is less aware of the talents and qualities ofthe children in comparison to a family, where every child gets special attention from his/her parents; or that inthe Homes it often happens that only children with particular capacities are cared for, while others are left behind
	- Others also explained that if they had a fight or a particular situation outside the institution, they could not always share it with the staff , because they would have made a bigdeal out of it.
	- Some of them underlined that sometimes they felt NGOs interfered too much in their lives

- According to a systematic review on caregiving interventions, The most frequently applied instruments were the Cattell Infant Intelligence Scale (Cattell, 1940) and the Denver II (Frankenburg &amp; Dodds, 1990), both measuring intelligence and developmental quotients.
