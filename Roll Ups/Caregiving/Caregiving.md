Successful interventions in improving caregiving 
What is the importance of caregiving in influencing child outcomes? 

# Why is caregiving crucial? 
- According to Aangan[^3], The children’s answer to our first question, about the first three things they would like to change about their institution, was clear and unanimous:
	Staff – Child Interaction:
		“The staff does not understand us”, said 70% CICL, 50% CNCP.
		45% said the Probation Officer had “never called us for a discussion or explained things to us.”
		- Disciplinary Issues:
“If there is a problem in the home, caretakers and monitors handle it.
They beat us up”, said 65% CICL, 60% CNCP.
-  Structured Recreation:
 “We wish they would allow us to play more and have more fun,” said
24% CNCP and 19% CICL.

## Effects of Sub-optimal care
In a systematic review[^4]
- Children may develop a low-quality attachment bond or even lack an attachment relationship altogether in the absence of adequate care
- Taken together with the experience of violence and abuse, this lack may impact the child’s stress response system, and, in this way, the development and structure of the brain as well. These changes to neurodevelopment may lead to mental health problems, such as depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and internalizing and externalizing problems
- individuals with a history of early institutional care showed more academic difficulties and deficits in social skills, such as maintaining trustful interpersonal relationships (Frank, Klass, Earls, &amp; Eisenberg, 1996; Merz, McCall, &amp; Wright, 2013).
- child maltreatment has been related to epigenetic changes in the stress response axis (Hecker, Radtke, Hermenau, Papassotiropoulos, &amp; Elbert, 2016; McGowan et al., 2009)
- Usually, the child care institutions are able to offer basic provisions of food and shelter, but they lack adequate means to offer sensitive, child-oriented care, possibly leading to the emotional and physical neglect of many children (Oliveira et al., 2012; Vashchenko et al., 2010)
- the reported worldwide rates of violence against children in institutional care were 6 times higher than those of children living in family-based foster care of interventions to improve care practices in institutions, the paper described the major negative effects of poor caregiving
- In a review paper on the impact of institutionalization on children, -  
	- indiscriminate friendliness as behavior that is affectionate and friendly toward all adults (including strangers) without the fear or caution that is typical  in young children. In these cases the children’s behavior toward a stranger cannot be discriminated from their behavior toward their primary caregivers. 
	- found that indiscriminate friendliness was still present in adolescents who had been institutionalized as children but who were later fostered to unstable foster care placements.
	- Researchers have  consistently found associations between orphanage children’s indiscriminate friendliness  and their behavior problems
	- Chisholm (1998) has suggested that indiscriminate friendliness may serve an adaptive function in the context of the orphanage environment where emotional  resources are extremely limited. 
		- Amid the passivity of the orphanage an indiscriminately friendly child may receive what little attention caregivers have to offer. 

## Positive effects of good-quality care
- [^4]Structural interventions and caregiver trainings contribute to an improvement in children's living conditions in institutional care
- Training of caregivers and structural changes have beneficial effects on the children's development
- The prevention of physical and emotional abuse in institutional care has widely been neglected
- More efforts are needed to focus on the improvement of general caregiving environment, caregiver child relationship and maltreatment prevention
- In a seminar on institutional care[^9], we learned that among the positive aspects, the love and care that the staff  showed to the children was the fi rst point mentioned, together with thefacilities available and good education

# Broad recommendations for caregiving from research
A systematic review of caregiving interventions[^4] recommended the need for
- Broad, theory based approaches are needed and should be tested using rigorous scientific standards
- Responsive non-violent caregiver-child interactions are crucial to children's physical and behavioral develpmnet
- Beyond improving caregiver-child attachment, caregiver trainings should also focus on prevention of violence and abuse in institutional care
- Improving the quality of care may be more important than the type of care (eg. institutional care vs foster care)
- Our findings have shown that less than one third of the intervention approaches were theory based, and only three studies applied manualized interventions. Therefore, we advocate for developing theory-based and manualized training concepts for institutional caregivers that may be based on attachment and that can be tested using rigorous scientific standards. [Caregiving](Roll%20Ups/Caregiving/Caregiving.md)

# Caregiving Interventions
- According to a review on caregiving interventions[^4], Many of the intervention approaches included in the studies ofthe present review have some important components in common: They all aim at improving the caregiver–child relationship (attachment and bonding), enriching the caregiving environment through additional stimulation and quality time, and at least some focus on preventing maltreatment and further harm
- One promising approach that is theory based and manualized is [[FairstartGlobal]] (www.fairstartglobal.com). It is a curriculum rooted in attachment theory that promotes appropriate caregiver–child interactions and relationships. Its unique benefits include free availability on the Internet, implementation flexibility, administrator and staff involvement in creating its implementation, translation into 26 languages, and current implementation in numerous countries around the globe 
- - [[The Bucharest Early Intervention Project]] (Koga,  Smyke, Zeanah, 2003; Zeanah, Smyke, & Koga,  2003) has begun providing a foster care inter-  vention in Bucharest, Romania, in which they  are following the development of children re-  moved from orphanage to foster care and com-  paring their developmental progress to both  children who remain in orphanage and a com-  munity comparison group. 
	- [[The St. Petersburg– U.S.A. Orphanage Project]] (McCall, Muha-  medrahimov, Groark, Palmov, & Nikiforova,  2003), operating in three baby homes in St. Petersburg, is providing different interventions to examine which are most effective in reducing the developmental impact of institutional rearing. I
		- In one baby home, orphanage staff are being trained in child development  and sensitive responsiveness. 
		- In a second,  both caregiver training and structural changes  that reduce the number of different caregivers  and increase their stability in the lives of the children are being implemented. 
		- A third baby  home is serving as a “no intervention” comparison group 
- Contrary to typical settings, - Irvington House[^6], a home for 130 children,  considered trying to imitate some sort of family life, but quickly came to realize that this was not only impractical but probably undesirable and dishonest as well. 
	- We have therefore been quite clear with ourselves and we hope with the children, that Irvington house is a house and not a home. That counselors are counselors and not parents, and that the other children in the dormitory are members of a group, not of a family. 

# Caregiver Profile
- [^2]The Miracle Foundation Method provided for hiring of a qualified social worker at Anwesha.
	- The social worker engaged in counselling of the children, guiding the house parents,observing and supervising the work of the coaching teachers, following up ontraining of children and house parents and documentation-related work. (Page 11)
- In dealing with children who are victims of violence[^8], it's recommended that
	- The Home shall appoint staff only after adequate screening about the past record of the staff, ensuring that the staff has not shown any particular behavior in the past that could be a pot ent source of danger e .g. psychiatric disorders causing violence or self destructive behavior, is not suffering from substance addiction/ habit (including tobacco and alcohol), exhibits abusive behavior, offending or criminal behavior, etc. Full care shall be taken not to appoint any person habituated to dangerous drugs.
- In a seminar organized by Udayan Care on institutionalization[^9], - In general it is advisable that caregivers are not too old and the generational gap among them and the children reﬂects that between children and parents. (Page 29)


## Caregiver Number & Types
At Irvington House, a strict staff selection criterion was used, 
- The child-care staff is for the most part college-trained. The average age is 24.
	- We are particularly concerned to find people interested in and responsive to professional supervision
	- The child-care workers are directly supervised by trained group workers, with individual conferences as the main supervisory tool 
	- We look for people interested in eventually undertaking graduate training in social work or a related field and who will be, consequently, professionally as well as personally motivated. 
	- As a matter of policy, we always have had at least one male worker assigned to the three older groups
	- We have tried consciously to keep the numebr of different adults with whom a child must have a meaningful relationship to a minimum
	- A child-care worker once assigned to a given dormitory, has remained there throughout his employment at the house. 
	- Each worker has a case load of approximately 20 children. 


According to guidelines for institutional care in Ethiopia[^5], The profile of the human-power shall be:
    * Manager / Administrator: The manager / administrator shall have at least his/her first degree in sociology, psychology, or other related fields of study with, at least, two years of relevant experience.
    * Secretary: The Secretary shall, at least, have a diploma in office management, accounting or other related fields with, at least, two years of experience in similar line of work.
    * Finance Officer: The Finance officer shall, at least, have a diploma in accounting or other related fields with a minimum experience of two years in the area.
    * Purchaser:The Purchaser shall, at least, have a diploma in material management or other related fields with a minimum experience of two years in the area.
    * Storekeeper: The Storekeeper shall, at least, complete grade twelve with a minimum experience of two years in the area.
    * Cashier: The Cashier shall, at least, have a diploma in accounting or other related fields with a minimum experience of two years in the area.
    * Sanitary and Guards: Sanitary and guards should complete at least grade six with a minimum experience of two years in the area.
    * Health assistant: A Health Assistant shall, at least, have a certificate with a minimum experience of two years in the area.

    * Home Mothers: A Home Mother should complete at least grade six and shall have at least a three months relevant training and a minimum experience of one year as an assistant home mother.
- [^11]Udayan care recommends
	- The rule deals with the basis for staffing like categories of children, capacity of CCI, nature of duties, hours of duty etc.
	- While key regular staff include
		-  person-in-charge, 
		- probation officer/CWO/CW, 
		- counselor/psychologist/mental health expert, 
		- house mother/house father, 
		- para-medical staff/staff nurse/nursing orderly 
		- storekeeper-cum-accountant; 
		- educator/tutor, medical officer, art & craft & activity teacher and PT instructor-cum-yoga teacher psychiatrist may be hired as part-time staff. 
		- The rule suggests a staffing pattern for a CCI with capacity for 100 children. Some other important conditions to be followed include the following: 
			- Only female person-in-charge and staff to be appointed for CCIs housing girls 
			- Those associated with CCIs should not be convicted persons or those 
			  involved in immoral act, child abuse, employment of child labour, moral turpitude or should hold any political office during his/her tenure 
			- No one should be appointed or work in CCIs without police verification. 
			- CCIs housing infants should hire ayahs and paramedical staff as per need. (Page 26)


## Elements of Training
- [^2]According to Miracle Foundation's approach, Anwesha underwent a complete training in areas of supporting family culture rights of the child, attachment, discipline techniques, childdevelopment, health care – preventative & curative, gender roles, sexual abuseprevention, communication skills, conflict resolution and stress management.
- [^9]Cultural, social, gender and religious sensitisation should also be assured. Training in dealing appropriately with challenging behaviour, including conflict resolution techniques and means to prevent acts of harm or self-harm, should be provided to all care staff  employed by the institutions’ management. In (Page 29)
- According to a seminar on mental health in institutional care, 
	- The Participatory Action Research (PAR) was a six month study involving researchers, caretakers, administrators, and children. The aim was to deﬁne an Appropriate Technique and an Efﬁcient Management Strategy in the care of children with behavioural difﬁculties. 
	- PAR has three essential ingredients:
		- Developing Self-understanding;
		- Paying Attention to Insights
		- Respecting the other and Reciprocity
	- To be able to do PAR effectively, basic communication skills are also important. 
	- Listening to understand is the most important communication skill that we often miss. 
	- Through PAR. we intended involving the children in ﬁnding a more meaningful way to ex-press themselves. We also wanted to involve the staff as partners in this dialogue. We attempted to evolve a self-sustaining and participatory methodology to solve the daily problems of aggression among children.


## Right attitudes: 
There are some very helpful attitudes for a Participatory Approach thatwe could take from Carl Rogers, the founder of Humanistic Psychology:
- Empathy or Accurate Understanding;
- Non-Judgemental Attitude or Unconditional Positive Regard;
- Genuineness or truthfulness.
# Caregiver support
- [^2]For Miracle Foundation. ‘Tea time with house parents’, the practice of Miracle staff spending informal timewith caregivers enabled them to unwind, open up, share their joys and concernsand feel acknowledged as being important.
- [^2]Miracle Staff, House parent Diary served to be a readyreference of their important tasks and responsibilities.
- Prerna[^7] recommends self care tips for all caregivers
	- Get 8 hours of sleep.
	* Drink adequate water and make sure you are eating healthy meals.
	* Be self compassionate: You are also going through a difficult time, it's okay to struggle
	* Know your limitations: In the pandemic situation, we have limited resources to help ourselves and others, acknowledging this would help caregivers to feel less exhausted and guilty.
	* Regularly engage in coping strategies: Deep Breathing, Exercising, Practicing a hobby, taking regular breaks, self-care activities, using humor in day to day life, Affirmations, Systematic Body relaxation, grounding, Mandala making etc.
	* Stay in contact with loved ones.

# Interactions with Children

## Key principles governing interactions
- According to the study conducted at Irvington House[^6],
	- For young children a paramount need is to feel that there is someone who really cares for him or her as an individual human being, someone with whom and for whom he is special. In addition to this special one to one relationship, the child must also feel that all, or most, of the people around him like and respect him for what he is. We have called this basic concept, along with teh child-care practices that have grown out of it, "individualization. 
	- We assumed that small children need relatively small, self-contained settings for their basic physical care. They need the opportunity for privacy, some belongings which are their very own, some which are to be shared and the freedom to explore within boundaries that set unobtrusive but firm limits on impulse. 
	- A final assumption in relation to the program offered is that any positive life experience, no matter what its duration, strengthens the child in terms of meeting subsequent life experiences. 
	- There is no concept of "spoiling the children" as while it is morally and professionally impossibly to not provide the maximum of what we have, our assumption is that if we offer this, a child is better equipped to meet the vicissitudes of whatever his life may be when he leaves us. 
	- The one-to-one relationship thus developed between counselor and child is to give the child a feeling that, despite some of the necessary impersonality and antiseptic quality of an institutional environment, someone on the staff cares for him or her as an individual human being above and beyond the requirements of the job. 
- In a seminar organized by Udayan Care on Institutionalization[^9], it was noted that
	-  especially in residential institutions funded by religious bodies or in governmental institutions of countries withlittle concern for the beliefs of minorities, children’s right to equality and non-discrimination could be seriouslyneglected. 
	- All children placed in institutions should have opportunities to express their opinions, practice theirreligion, function in their native language and participate in social activities in the community they belong to.Children’s right to equality and non-discrimination should be always upheld. 
	- caregiver should act as a professional and not as a friend to the child, there by reducing the possibility of a conflict of interest or inappropriate conduct.43 (Page 30)
- Following 5 intervention areas:
		- Accessibility of staff 
		- Quality of interaction 
		- Information 
		- Orientation 
		- Disciplinary Action

-  Positivize interaction of staff and child 
		- Standardized interaction guidelines 
		-  Focus on entry level intervention for new admissions
		-  Exit level intervention planning for children leaving 
		- Standardized discipline code  
		- Role definition: Interaction responsibilities assigned to key staff
		- Create child-friendly orientation /informative material  and reception unit model
		- Develop standardized discipline code
		-  Capacity building of staff to use thismaterial to make children feel reassured, informed, safe.
		
# Recommendation II : Staff Motivation 
The staff’s opinions differed a little. Their top concern areas were :
-  Playing equipment for children. (57%)
-  Motivation: Higher salaries; more holidays; acknowledgement from and
accessibility to authorities (31%)
-  Security systems (to reduce cases of running away). (31%)
-  Institutional Budget - increase and timely disbursement. (17%)
-  1 Infrastructure (building renovations, improvement etc) . (4.9%)

-  Staff motivation : 
		- Standardized motivation and Reinforcement Program. Develop a state level recognition award system based on identifying best practices;
		-  Standardized discipline code for offences by staff
		- Ensure that innovative ideas, individuals and institutions are identified and reinforced
# Recommendation III : Operational definition of effectiveness
-  Need to define effectiveness of institutions factoring in staff, children's and governing authorities perspectives
			- Standardized Evaluation of performance,criteria &systems. 
			- Standardize monitoring tool combining criteria related to infrastructure,interaction and activity . 
			- External Evaluation through Vigilance Committees. 
			- Develop self monitoring tool.  
			- Capacity building of staff to use tool for internal monitoring and goal setting   (Page 12)


[^1]According to a paper authored by the Duke Global Health Institute on psychosocial wellbeing of CNCP in institutional settings, the ideal outcome for the **Caregiving**  factor was for the child to have at least one adult (age 18 or over) who provides consistent care, attention, and support. 
- Caregiving was “seen as good when there is an identified adult (parent or guardian) who provides the child with a stable, nurturing, and emotionally secure environment. The relationship between the child and the caregiver should provide physical and psychological security for the child. 
- This factor captured how committed the caregiver was to the child and to his/her involvement with the child”.

# Care Practices
- In dealing with children who are victims of violence[^8], it is recommended that the safety/risk assessment in relation to victims' known and likely activities, the potential for bullying and abuse within and outside of the Home and where applicable the impact of emergency admissions on the victims shall also be carried out, recorded in writing and regularly reviewed by the organization running the Home in consultation with subject matter experts.
- The shelter home authority shall evolve a Crisis Management Plan (CMP) to address a range of foreseeable crises (e.g. death, outbreaks of illness, fires, serious allegations or complaints, significant accidents, staff shortage, and control problems within or outside the home).
- Rainbow[^10] recommends a loose schedule for all caregivers with milestones 
	- Weekly 
		-  Issuing of stationery and toiletries to children
		- Weekly Staff Meetings
		-  Facilitation of children-parent phone calls
	- Monthly
		- Parents Meetings/Staff Meeting/Bala Sabha
		- Attending monthly school meetings
		- Budget Planning for CCI
		- Birthdays/Festival celebrations
		- Health Check-ups
		- Stock taking
		- Checking of child records and registers
	- Quarterly
		- Purchasing of clothes
		- Outing for children
	- Half Yearly
		- Purchasing of Footwear
		- Purchasing of bedsheet
		- De-worming
	- Annual
		- Purchase of uniforms and school supplies
		- Sports day, annual day
		- outstation trips
		- stock taking of fixed assets
- [^9]At a seminar on mental health in institutions, Dr. Sen advise
	- d towards a major consideration of the roles of caregivers when applying certain changes to the everyday management of the institution, especially because, in terms of mental health care, a comprehensive approach, where the caregivers, the managers and the psychologists and psychiatrists work together, is needed.Hierarchy among personnel is often significant and not carefully evaluated, which seriously affects the functioning of institutions. 
	- At the sametime, it is imperative for caregivers to know how to prepare the children in case they are leaving the institution for a different job, instead of disappearing and suddenly leaving them alone. 
		- Caregivers should be as constant as possible and, when about to leave their jobs for any reason, they should know how toprepare the children to de-attach.
	- Most service providers ask the children to repeatedly narrate their stories, putting them through undeniable pain. In the worst cases, children are blamed for their negative experiences, or get further maltreated
	- practitioners, to ensure that children do not suffer additional victimisation through adverse labelling.
	- A couple of the participants mentioned that the staff  of the institutions is less aware of the talents and qualities ofthe children in comparison to a family, where every child gets special attention from his/her parents; or that inthe Homes it often happens that only children with particular capacities are cared for, while others are left behind
	- Others also explained that if they had a fight or a particular situation outside the institution, they could not always share it with the staff , because they would have made a bigdeal out of it.
	- Some of them underlined that sometimes they felt NGOs interfered too much in their lives


# Assessment Tools
- According to a systematic review on caregiving interventions, The most frequently applied instruments were the Cattell Infant Intelligence Scale (Cattell, 1940) and the Denver II (Frankenburg &amp; Dodds, 1990), both measuring intelligence and developmental quotients.
