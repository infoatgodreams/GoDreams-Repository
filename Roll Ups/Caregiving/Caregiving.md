Successful interventions in improving caregiving 



[^1]- According to a paper authored by the Duke Global Health Institute on psychosocial wellbeing of CNCP in institutional settings, the ideal outcome for the **Caregiving**  factor was for the child to have at least one adult (age 18 or over) who provides consistent care, attention, and support. 
- Caregiving was “seen as good when there is an identified adult (parent or guardian) who provides the child with a stable, nurturing, and emotionally secure environment. The relationship between the child and the caregiver should provide physical and psychological security for the child. 
- This factor captured how committed the caregiver was to the child and to his/her involvement with the child”.
