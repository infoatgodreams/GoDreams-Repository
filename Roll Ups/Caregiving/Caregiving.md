Successful interventions in improving caregiving 
What is the importance of caregiving in influencing child outcomes? 

# Why is caregiving crucial? 
- According to Aangan[^3], The children’s answer to our first question, about the first three things they would like to change about their institution, was clear and unanimous:
	Staff – Child Interaction:
		“The staff does not understand us”, said 70% CICL, 50% CNCP.
		45% said the Probation Officer had “never called us for a discussion or explained things to us.”
		- Disciplinary Issues:
“If there is a problem in the home, caretakers and monitors handle it.
They beat us up”, said 65% CICL, 60% CNCP.
-  Structured Recreation:
 “We wish they would allow us to play more and have more fun,” said
24% CNCP and 19% CICL.

## Effects of Sub-optimal care
In a systematic review[^4]
- Children may develop a low-quality attachment bond or even lack an attachment relationship altogether in the absence of adequate care
- Taken together with the experience of violence and abuse, this lack may impact the child’s stress response system, and, in this way, the development and structure of the brain as well. These changes to neurodevelopment may lead to mental health problems, such as depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and internalizing and externalizing problems
- individuals with a history of early institutional care showed more academic difficulties and deficits in social skills, such as maintaining trustful interpersonal relationships (Frank, Klass, Earls, &amp; Eisenberg, 1996; Merz, McCall, &amp; Wright, 2013).
- child maltreatment has been related to epigenetic changes in the stress response axis (Hecker, Radtke, Hermenau, Papassotiropoulos, &amp; Elbert, 2016; McGowan et al., 2009)
- Usually, the child care institutions are able to offer basic provisions of food and shelter, but they lack adequate means to offer sensitive, child-oriented care, possibly leading to the emotional and physical neglect of many children (Oliveira et al., 2012; Vashchenko et al., 2010)
- the reported worldwide rates of violence against children in institutional care were 6 times higher than those of children living in family-based foster care of interventions to improve care practices in institutions, the paper described the major negative effects of poor caregiving:

## Positive effects of good-quality care
- [^4]Structural interventions and caregiver trainings contribute to an improvement in children's living conditions in institutional care
- Training of caregivers and structural changes have beneficial effects on the children's development
- The prevention of physical and emotional abuse in institutional care has widely been neglected
- More efforts are needed to focus on the improvement of general caregiving environment, caregiver child relationship and maltreatment prevention

# Broad recommendations for caregiving from research
A systematic review of caregiving interventions[^4] recommended the need for
- Broad, theory based approaches are needed and should be tested using rigorous scientific standards
- Responsive non-violent caregiver-child interactions are crucial to children's physical and behavioral develpmnet
- Beyond improving caregiver-child attachment, caregiver trainings should also focus on prevention of violence and abuse in institutional care
- Improving the quality of care may be more important than the type of care (eg. institutional care vs foster care)
- Our findings have shown that less than one third of the intervention approaches were theory based, and only three studies applied manualized interventions. Therefore, we advocate for developing theory-based and manualized training concepts for institutional caregivers that may be based on attachment and that can be tested using rigorous scientific standards.

# Caregiving Interventions
- According to a review on caregiving interventions[^4], Many of the intervention approaches included in the studies ofthe present review have some important components in common: They all aim at improving the caregiver–child relationship (attachment and bonding), enriching the caregiving environment through additional stimulation and quality time, and at least some focus on preventing maltreatment and further harm
- One promising approach that is theory based and manualized is [[FairstartGlobal]] (www.fairstartglobal.com). It is a curriculum rooted in attachment theory that promotes appropriate caregiver–child interactions and relationships. Its unique benefits include free availability on the Internet, implementation flexibility, administrator and staff involvement in creating its implementation, translation into 26 languages, and current implementation in numerous countries around the globe

# Caregiver Profile

## Elements of Training
- [^2]According to Miracle Foundation's approach, Anwesha underwent a complete training in areas of supporting family culture rights of the child, attachment, discipline techniques, childdevelopment, health care – preventative & curative, gender roles, sexual abuseprevention, communication skills, conflict resolution and stress management. (Page 11)

# Caregiver support
- [^2]For Miracle Foundation. ‘Tea time with house parents’, the practice of Miracle staff spending informal timewith caregivers enabled them to unwind, open up, share their joys and concernsand feel acknowledged as being important.
- [^2]Miracle Staff, House parent Diary served to be a readyreference of their important tasks and responsibilities.

# Interactions with Children
- Following 5 intervention areas:
		- Accessibility of staff 
		- Quality of interaction 
		- Information 
		- Orientation 
		- Disciplinary Action

-  Positivize interaction of staff and child 
		- Standardized interaction guidelines 
		-  Focus on entry level intervention for new admissions
		-  Exit level intervention planning for children leaving 
		- Standardized discipline code  
		- Role definition: Interaction responsibilities assigned to key staff
		- Create child-friendly orientation /informative material  and reception unit model
		- Develop standardized discipline code
		-  Capacity building of staff to use thismaterial to make children feel reassured, informed, safe.
		
# Recommendation II : Staff Motivation 
The staff’s opinions differed a little. Their top concern areas were :
-  Playing equipment for children. (57%)
-  Motivation: Higher salaries; more holidays; acknowledgement from and
accessibility to authorities (31%)
-  Security systems (to reduce cases of running away). (31%)
-  Institutional Budget - increase and timely disbursement. (17%)
-  1 Infrastructure (building renovations, improvement etc) . (4.9%)

-  Staff motivation : 
		- Standardized motivation and Reinforcement Program. Develop a state level recognition award system based on identifying best practices;
		-  Standardized discipline code for offences by staff
		- Ensure that innovative ideas, individuals and institutions are identified and reinforced
# Recommendation III : Operational definition of effectiveness
-  Need to define effectiveness of institutions factoring in staff, children's and governing authorities perspectives
			- Standardized Evaluation of performance,criteria &systems. 
			- Standardize monitoring tool combining criteria related to infrastructure,interaction and activity . 
			- External Evaluation through Vigilance Committees. 
			- Develop self monitoring tool.  
			- Capacity building of staff to use tool for internal monitoring and goal setting   (Page 12)


[^1]According to a paper authored by the Duke Global Health Institute on psychosocial wellbeing of CNCP in institutional settings, the ideal outcome for the **Caregiving**  factor was for the child to have at least one adult (age 18 or over) who provides consistent care, attention, and support. 
- Caregiving was “seen as good when there is an identified adult (parent or guardian) who provides the child with a stable, nurturing, and emotionally secure environment. The relationship between the child and the caregiver should provide physical and psychological security for the child. 
- This factor captured how committed the caregiver was to the child and to his/her involvement with the child”.

# Assessment Tools
- According to a systematic review on caregiving interventions, The most frequently applied instruments were the Cattell Infant Intelligence Scale (Cattell, 1940) and the Denver II (Frankenburg &amp; Dodds, 1990), both measuring intelligence and developmental quotients.
