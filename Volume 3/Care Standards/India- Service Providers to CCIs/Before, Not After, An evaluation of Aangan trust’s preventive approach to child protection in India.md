# Brief:
* Scope & Description: This study documents and evaluates the harm prevention work carried out by the children’s rights nonprofit Aangan Trust since late 2015 in Konia, a peri-urban slum area in Varanasi, a large city in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Results show that community-level harm prevention work involves considerable challenges, especially in a context where structural factors militate against child wellbeing.

# Existing Strategies for Child Protection:

* Child protection workers remove children from places where they are being exploited and then attempt to support their recovery and social integration.
* Existing strategies most often include initiatives to deter exploiters through criminalization, or to raise awareness among at-risk groups. However, these efforts do not fully address the wide spectrum of vulnerabilities to exploitation that children experience, nor do they empower children and families to address those vulnerabilities. 
* Other efforts attempt to proactively target child harm by leveraging universal services like education and health. Yet progress through these top-down programs is slow, professional and specialist capacity for child protection in these services is often lacking, and fragmented services mean that vulnerable children often fall through the cracks.
* But the prevention of structural, physical, sexual and emotional violence against children is an emerging global policy priority, and advocates are increasingly focused on “systems strengthening” approaches that seek to improve holistic overall functioning of child protection systems. Experts agree that such approaches should include the child, family, community, and society crossing the strata of the socioecological model – and should connect different policy sectors such as health, social services, education, and justice.
* The social protection system, which accounts for 1.3 percent of public expenditure, offers families of vulnerable children additional funds through welfare programs or “schemes. They include cash transfers for pensions, education support, or poverty alleviation; food transfers; food and fuel subsidies; and nutritional supplements.
* Indian non-profit groups play a crucial role in bridging gaps between children and families and the existing child protection system.


# Aangan’s Child Protection Model:

* Aangan believes in the efficacy of grassroots organising to help people address their own problems, to take advantage of the services and structures available to them and to improve these services and structures over time.
* Aangan’s program is premised on the belief that a trained group of local women that are knowledgeable, committed and available are best placed to help their own children and communities.
* Over time, CPVs build relationships of mutual respect with officials by regularly showing up at their offices, discussing community issues and helping officials to address identified needs. 
* Aangan believes that this process improves service providers’ performance, including their accountability and responsiveness. They call this “activating” government officials
* The Aangan’s prevention model is based on a theory of change (shown in the table below) which involves program implementation (inputs and outputs) and program results (outcomes and impacts)
* Key Assumptions:
    * Aangan assumes that its model builds trust between duty bearers and community members. Such that it assumes that children and caregivers know the CPVs to be resources for child protection issues and trust them with their problems.
    * Aangan’s theory of change assumes that children regularly attend the Shakti and Chauraha groups.
    * An assumption of Aangan’s theory of change is that the stipend and other non-tangible benefits of participation are sufficient to motivate CPVs to do the work required by the model.

	 ## Key grassroot level services and structures are:
    * Child Protection Volunteers (CPVs) 
        * CPVs act as intermediaries between children, families and service providers – teachers, police, healthcare workers and political appointees. 
        * CPVs collect household-level information on risks and child wellbeing using a mobile app, information that then informs their organising approach and priorities. 
        * CPVs run programs for young girls and boys in their areas that build resilience, awareness and agency. 
        * And they strengthen relationships between local service providers and community members by helping them to do their jobs and holding them accountable to their child protection duties. 
        * The CPVs learn information on children’s rights, relevant legislation, protection issues and available welfare schemes and the importance of and procedures for obtaining identity documents. 
        * The training includes practical skills for negotiating with service providers, collecting local data and responding to situations involving at-risk children.
        * Aangan encourages the Child Protection Volunteers (CPVs) to come up with their own name for their group. To ensure local ownership and sustainability, they should not be formally affiliated with Aangan but rather be “anchored” in local communities and perceived as local resources. 
        * The CPVs gave their group the name “Udaan Mahila Sangataan,” based on a popular television show. Select residents recognized this title, calling them by “Udaan,” “Mahila Mandal,” or “Shakti.”
        * Data show CPVs have successfully initiated meetings with service providers at the ward and block levels to build trust and rapport, including with the auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM), anganwadi, ward member and police. Aangan staff explained that, “Whereas CPVs used to go to police for help, police have since started coming to CPVs for help. Now, community members go directly to the police.”
    * Community Help Desks (CHDs)
        * CHDs are established to sign people up for Aadhaar cards, birth certificates, or welfare programs (“schemes”), or to offer a platform for discussion of local issues ranging from child marriage to the lack of fencing to protect children from the railway line.
        * Community Help Desks in Konia (‘CHDs’, often referred to in Konia as ‘camps’ or ‘meetings’) and said that they found them beneficial, particularly for letting community members know what resources officials can provide.

		# Measures and Instruments used in the program [[Assessment Tools]]
    * The caregiver survey:
        * The caregiver survey included sections on: household composition and demographics; knowledge and uptake of identity documents; knowledge and uptake of welfare schemes and other government programs; social norms and beliefs; knowledge of laws; and relationships with service providers, including healthcare workers, police, ward officers (government-appointed head of the local municipal unit), teachers and Aangan. 
        * Participants in qualitative surveys were asked questions on local child labor issues, prevention strategies and social norms.
    * The child survey:
        * The child survey included sections on: demographics, education, work, relationships with service providers, safe spaces, personal sense of agency and self-confidence, plans for the future, and social norms and beliefs.
        * In this study, the ILO-SIMPOC child labor module was implemented in the child quantitative survey to assess prevalence by both Indian and international legal standards.
        * In this survey, children’s sense of agency and self-esteem were also measured using the General Self-Efficacy Scale and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, both widely used in international contexts with this age group. Averages for self-esteem were close to “neutral” (2.5 out of 5), which suggests that these particular instruments, not formally tested in the Indian context, may have not been fully comprehensible to participants.  
    * Vignettes
        * For this study, vignettes were designed for qualitative interviews with 7 caregivers and 7 children in each site. These probed empirical and normative expectations, as well as sanctions, for child labor, child marriage and school dropout
        * Caregivers and children answered questions about a vignette describing a hypothetical case of a child dropping out of school to engage in child labor


# Outcomes and Impacts of the program:

* Education:
    * This study defines “out-of-school” to include children who have never attended school, who are not currently enrolled in school and who have missed more than 30 consecutive days of school in the past year.31
    * Overall, children in the intervention site were 0.7 times as likely to be out of school as those in the comparison site. Crucial to this difference is that significantly fewer children have never been enrolled in school in Konia (5.1 percent) compared to Deendayalpur (9.1 percent).
    * The positive effects of Aangan’s model in Konia are even more impressive when considering the fact that primary schools in Konia are less physically accessible than those in Deendayalpur, where there is also a nonprofit conducting some efforts to enroll children in school.
    * Preventative Strategies for School Dropout: 
        * Enrollment drives: 
            * To prevent children from dropping out of school in Konia, CPVs first conduct school enrollment drives. They share information on individual OOSC with local schools and with the Aangan field office, who alerts district-level actors as appropriate. 
        * Raising awareness: 
            * CPVs also attempt to raise awareness in Konia among caregivers about the importance of education, through Parents’ Circles and conversations with individual households
        * Participation and monitoring in school committees: 
            * Finally, CPVs conduct monitoring of school quality and participate in school management committees (SMCs), which are forums mandated by RTE to encourage more community and parental involvement). 
            * CPVs regularly attend the SMCs and encourage other parents to come. CPVs also regularly show up at the school to get information on teacher attendance and midday meal provision
    * Reasons for dropping out:
        * Finances:
            * Parents and caregivers in both sites discussed the costs of schooling as a principal factor behind school dropout, including both the opportunity costs of not working and the actual costs of fees, books and uniforms. 
            * “Parents are unable to give education to their children because either they are poor and work as wage laborers, or the father is a drunkard,” explained the anganwadi worker, “so children have to work
        * Poor quality of infrastructure in public schools:
            * Despite these serious financial burdens, many families choose to bypass free public education in favor of low cost private schools. 
            * Among the reasons for this are acute issues with public school infrastructure, quality of instruction and teacher absenteeism
        * Safety and security of children:
            * It is equally applicable to pupils in government and private contexts, is security on the way to and at school. 
            * “The problem is harassment that girls are facing,” stated a school principal in Deendayalpur, “It has increased to such a level that parents have stopped sending their girls to school
        * Lack of identity documents. 
            * Although RTE makes it illegal to deny children entry to school on the basis of lack of documentation, caregivers and service providers described this as a serious roadblock for poor families.
* Child Labor:
    * Reasons for child labor:
        * In both places, the most commonly cited reason for work was to supplement family income and significantly more children (12 percent) in Konia said they worked in order to learn skills than did in Deendayalpur (3.5 percent)
        * Qualitative data do not show a social norm against child labor per se. Rather, there is a norm against child labor that keeps children out of school. CPVs indicated that they believe that, for some families, work is inevitable and encourage both school and part time work as a viable solution for poor families
        * Factors other than poverty are relevant to child labor’s continuing social acceptability
        * Unlike with child marriage, where the health consequences for children were widely factored into prevention efforts, the health implications of child labor were not raised by any interviewees. Yet evidence strongly suggests however that children’s work puts their physical and mental health at risk: 21.3 percent of child workers in Konia and 15.7 percent in Deendayalpur work with hazardous materials
        * Results suggest that a lack of faith in the potential of school to increase work prospects plays a significant role in attitudes towards delaying the start of work
    * Problems with child labor:
        * Participants stated that labor trafficking is a problem. “Children on the guise of laborers are taken away and trafficked,” said Deendayalpur’s anganwadi worker, “They sell off the children and they are employed for work.”
    * Preventative Strategy to address child labor:
        * Access to goverment schemes:
            * CPVs connect families and vulnerable children to schemes and skill training. According to Aangan’s data, 35 working children were “linked to” the Nayi Manzil scheme (providing education and livelihoods support for minority youths over 17 years); 17 children formerly in domestic work were linked to computer education and 15 were linked to other skill development schemes
            * One 15-year-old child from Konia said, “She can go to the ward officer and ask him to link her to some government scheme.” However, as described in more detail in the Schemes Section VI.C.vii below, it is unclear if these schemes (if they arrive at all) are sufficient to address the various factors that drive children into child labor.
* Child Marriage
    * Aangan’s registers show that there have been 33 cases of child marriage among the 300 families included in the intervention in the two years that the program has been running. 
    * Beyond child marriages facilitated by parents, participants in both study sites described the growing prevalence of “love marriages.” These involve children who willingly elope and then marry to give legitimacy to relationships that would be otherwise forbidden by their families due to social or religious factors, or that would put the boy at risk of criminal prosecution: Indian law criminalizes all sexual relationships with girls under 18. This recent change in the law poses a serious risk to consensual adolescent romances, allowing parents to press criminal charges against unapproved partners that their daughters chose.
    * Four service providers in Konia and none in the comparison site discussed “paid-bride marriages,” which appear to be instances of sex trafficking, a form of structural and sexual violence. These cases involve unknown persons from outside the community who facilitate a girl’s marriage without asking for a dowry. After a wedding ceremony that promotes the pretense of legitimate marriage to one man, girls are then taken elsewhere to serve as prostitutes for several men. “The parents get lured by money,”
    * Once they have taken place, child marriages in India are valid. In principle, they can be annulled on request, but as of June 2018, only 36 such annulments had ever been successfully filed, nationally. The same challenges of secrecy and taboo apply to combating the problem
    * Preventative Strategies to Address Child Marriage:
        * Increasing Awareness:
            * The first preventative strategy that CPVs employ is the use of community campaigns with the police and Childline to increase awareness of risks associated with early marriage, the importance of education and the dangers of sex trafficking. Shakti programs can educate young girls about their rights and build their self-confidence and agency to keep themselves safe from harm.
        * Emphasising financial gains and Law:
            * However, proposing alternatives to delay marriage is a primary way that CPVs attempt to address this problem. One CPV explained how they intervened against the child marriage of one girl and told the parents that they would arrange for the girl’s Anudaan Marriage. Anudaan is a program run by the UP government, offering cash incentive (Rs. 35,000 or ~$500) to couples from families classified as Below Poverty Line for participation in a mass marriage, if they wait till the bride is 18. 
            * Beyond emphasizing this financial incentive to parents, CPVs attempt to prevent child marriages by emphasizing that the law prohibits this practice, as well as its negative health implications and effects on a girl’s education and potential for earning
        * Help from Childline and Police:
            * Success in these situations is largely contingent on CPVs’ having the trust and respect of community members. For this reason, they try to first resolve issues among community members and do not bring in the authorities unless necessary:
            * If it is not possible to avert a child marriage through community negotiations, CPVs turn to Childline or the police. In rare difficult cases, Aangan field or national staff intervenes directly to support CPVs in their efforts. CPVs also focus on educating parents, children and service providers about preventative resources, an area where their results are particularly positive
* Child Abuse:
    * Data indicate that CPVs’ efforts have made a significant difference for select children in Konia who have suffered instances of child abuse. 
    * Nevertheless, the strength of the taboo around these instances of violence and the fact that community members do not associate CPVs’ with any outside authority (Aangan or otherwise), limits CPVs’ ability to raise awareness about these serious rights violations or prevent them before they happen.  
    * CPVs commented that they are afraid to raise the issue of child abuse in community meetings because “it is a hidden issue. In another community, a CPV shared a child abuse story that leaked out and that broke a lot of trust and hurt everyone involved because a private story became public.” 
    * Now, CPVs say that they use training videos provided by Aangan Central to discuss child abuse more abstractly.
    * There is scope for Aangan to help improve CPVs’ technical skills to address these difficult cases of child abuse, and provide support in individual cases
* Mapping Risk
    * Effective harm prevention requires real-time data on who is at risk. CPVs in Konia support service providers’ efforts to better identify children and families in need of assistance by raising awareness of Childline, and building residents’ trust in the ward officer, police, teachers and healthcare workers by increasing contact with residents
    * Second, CPVs themselves map risk by making themselves visible and available to residents as potential confidants, through the Shakti and Chauraha circles, and the Aangan-designed survey on household vulnerability conducted via mobile app. 
    * Shakti and Chauraha circles
        * Aangan’s most successful risk mapping mechanisms are the Shakti and Chauraha circles, where children feel safe to share stories, and where CPVs appear to hear of most potential cases of child harm. 
        * The children in the Shakti and Chauraha programs also create a physical map of their community, which led to identification of physical areas of high-risk where men drink and gamble, and where girls without toilets in their home experience harassment and violence while walking to the public toilet. 
        * CPVs shared this map with the police, with the result, as the teacher explains, that “the police now are patrolling around Konia – eve teasing and molestation cases are down as a result.”
    * The mobile app is used to identify households without identity documents, bank accounts or signups for schemes, out of school children and child laborers. This information seems to be useful for Aangan Central office in setting priorities and advocacy, but less so at the community level
* Access and Uptake of ID Documents:
    * Difficulties in access to ID documents:
        * Bureaucratic inefficiency and corruption:
            * Residents complained that bureaucratic inefficiency and corruption make signing up for identity documents difficult. Long delays, unexplained denials of applications and multiple visits to the office during the work day were all common stories 
            * As a result, many families turn to expensive middlemen to help facilitate the application process: for many, these unforeseen costs make identity documents prohibitively expensive 
            * This problem was described in particular in reference to enrollment in Aadhaar, India’s national biometric ID system, and in the process required to secure birth certificates. 
        * Technical glitches:
            * Participants reported that Aadhaar’s biometric technology does not always work. More than one quarter of all caregivers and children interviewed shared stories of the system’s fingerprint technology malfunctioning
    * Issues with Aadhar:
        * Double enrollment:
            * Research has described this widespread problem of “double enrollment” as artificially inflating enrollment statistics and hiding deficiencies in the educational system 
        * Child trafficking:
            * Aadhaar cards can also more directly put children at risk. The Varanasi representative of the Anti Human-Trafficking Unit described cases where traffickers had falsified Aadhaar cards of children to avoid detection by law enforcement, something confirmed by the Childline District coordinator: “If the person wants to employ the child then he will put 18 years as their age in Aadhaar card … We have rescued children from people like this.”
        * Impact on birth certificates:
            * The government’s public drive to sign people up for Aadhaar and promote its benefits appears to have influenced residents’ assessment of the utility of birth certificates. 
            * Low rates of birth certificate ownership mean that children who have not yet signed up for (or are systematically excluded from) Aadhaar cards are denied their basic rights and access to services.
* Enrollment in Government Social Protection Programs:
    * Welfare programs are the most common social protection measures used by the Indian government. 
    * Aangan’s model considers uptake of these schemes as an essential means to building resilience to harm among families and children. 
    * Results indicate that Aangan is a useful resource that makes information about schemes more accessible to residents.
    * CPVs are a useful resource that raised general appreciation in Konia for the importance of schemes among community members and streamlined the enrollment process.  
    * This did not lead to significantly higher receipt of individual social protection programs. In both sites, overall rates of uptake were startlingly low. 
    * Less than three percent of primary caregivers reported being enrolled in a pension program or skill development scheme, in the National Livelihoods Mission, or in UP’s scheme to delay child marriage.
    * Barriers to accessing schemes included: 
        * corruption among government officials
        * lack of transparency around eligibility
        * lack of access to documentation needed to apply 
        * Illiteracy
        * failure to disperse benefits once enrolled
* Improved Service Provider, Performance and Trust:
    * Results showed that service providers in Konia have a positive view of the CPVs. The ward officer, school officials and healthcare workers all remarked that Aangan’s presence better informed them about local children’s issues and helped them effectively meet their responsibilities.
    * CPVs Address key issues with performance:
        * Reducing overwork:
            * For many providers, CPVs addressed their problem of overwork, a particular issue for local health and education professionals serving huge populations with acute needs, with low levels of training and support. These are significant and positive results, especially given how frequently people rotate through these positions
        * Access to healthcare:
            * Another caregiver reported that CPVs help families to access healthcare: “They escort and help us in getting medicines for those who cannot afford or they take us to the hospital if someone is ill.”
        * Raising Awareness about child protection:
            * Several examples showed how providers formerly unaware of or indifferent to particular child protection issues, are now taking concrete action to keep children safe
            * The principal of the government primary school also believes that Aangan has helped her do a better job of supporting students. “The benefit is that along with the children we, the teachers, also come to know about the government policies or programs and how these are going to benefit the children
        * Addressing corruption:
            * Corruption is pervasive in law enforcement and in political administration (fees for obtaining documents or benefits being the most commonly cited example). These factors contribute to low levels of trust towards officials among residents, who then do not seek out available services or ask for help in a time of crisis.
            * However, CPVs do not address the lack of collaboration between different providers, a problem evident across both sites, without difference, that significantly contributes to weak child protection services. 
            * CPVs engage individual service providers by connecting them to residents and their issues, for example, CHDs typically bring one service provider into the community. The ICPS mandated Village Level Child Protection Committees are not currently operational
* Transformation of Social Norms and Beliefs about Child Protection
    * CPVs contribute towards social “sanctions” for families that arrange marriages for their children or allow them to drop out of school. Their public events that prioritize children’s issues encourage both empirical and normative expectations around children’s rights.  
    * Efforts to transform social norms would benefit by greater engagement of male members of the household and elders.
    * An assumption of Aangan’s program is that CPV activities are reaching and positively influencing the people that are most relevant to upholding social norms that are harmful for children. Yet, no specific efforts were discussed to engage fathers or male members of the household. 
    * Family elders, who CPVs did not discuss engaging and are less likely to attend Parents’ Circles or CHDs, hold significant decision-making power within the household regarding children’s trajectories. These individuals often have a bias in favor of child marriage and child labor.
* Self-Efficacy and Self-Esteem Among Children 
    * Results suggest that Shakti and Chauraha programs have considerable short-term benefits for the self-esteem and self-worth of some children in Konia. This is particularly true for Shakti girls that go on to become CPVs. 
    * Girls feel aware and empowered. The key assumption behind increased self-efficacy and self-esteem is that children regularly attended Shakti or Chauraha, but data show those who are enrolled reported attending on average 5.4 times (the program is made up of 12 sessions). 
    * This is enough time to learn basic techniques for safety and knowledge of risks, but insufficient time for most children to have a transformational impact on their self-efficacy and self-worth. 
    * There are also no follow-up activities after the completion of these courses to encourage mentorship and continued learning. There are exceptions to this, for example, those Shakti girls that go on to become CPVs
    * For long term impact on self-esteem and self-efficacy, Aangan needs to emphasize improved attendance and continued long term mentorship opportunities.  Low attendance rates and the lack of any follow up mentorship become CPVs.


# Limitations of the program:

* With respect to CPWorking to transform social norms and practices relating to children’s rights among neighbours can carry significant costs for CPVs, including social ostracization and harassment from family and community members (“Many people taunt us as we visit the police station”). 
* Most significantly, many CPVs cannot afford the time spent away from caring for their own families and wage-earning work. As a result, these women are often unable to invest the requisite time in the community vigilance and household visits that are key to Aangan’s risk mapping. Several CPVs stated that the stipend they receive is insufficient
* In the results, the Bengali-speaking Muslims population is not represented due to bias in CPVs and the villagers.
* The results of Aangan’s model on individual outcome/input metrics may vary across the different areas, cities and states where it is implemented.


# Important Acts, Articles and Schemes:

* Article 39 of the Constitution: 
    * It directs that these children under the age of 18 should be given opportunities and facilities to develop in a healthy manner, in conditions of freedom and dignity and that they be protected against exploitation and against moral and material abandonment.
* Right to Education RTE):
    * Protection begins at school: the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, guarantees free primary education to all children ages 6-14 and funds are dedicated for free mid-day meals to incentivize attendance
* Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS):
    * The Government’s Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) provides critical health and nutritional programs (including food, education and primary healthcare) to pregnant women and nursing mothers, infants, preschool children and adolescent girls.
* Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS):
    * In 2009, the Ministry of Women and Child Development launched the Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS) to coordinate and strengthen the various structures, services and staff relevant to child wellbeing – from the grass roots level through the central government entities – and to raise public awareness of child rights and available services. 
    * ICPS provides care, support and rehabilitation services, including: emergency response to urgent cases through Childline, a toll-free 24/7 hotline; drop-in and long-term shelters for children in need; and family based non-residential care (foster care and adoption). 
    * ICPS also provides legally mandated support services through Child Welfare Committees, Juvenile Justice Boards and Special Juvenile Police Units
    * ICPS is implemented by state-level governments – through a State Child Protection Society and network of District Child Protection Units in each state – with financial and technical support from central government. 
    * ICPS also mandates the creation of village/ward, panchayat and block level child protection committees (CPCs). They are intended to raise awareness about child protection issues, facilitate local solutions to cases of harm or refer to appropriate authorities, disseminate information from the formal child protection system and improve performance by duty bearers
* International laws regarding child labour:
    * International law puts limits on the age at which a person can engage in work and the type of work that young people can do. Children under 18 cannot engage in work that is hazardous or categorized as “another worst form” of child labor. 
    * ILO Convention No. 138 sets the minimum age for work when compulsory schooling is no longer required, no lower than 15. There are also forms of “permissible light work” for children between 12 and 14 years, defined as any non-hazardous work that does not prejudice school attendance or exceed 14 hours per week. 
* The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act 2016
    * It prohibits work in any occupation or process for all children under 14 years. Nevertheless, several exceptions to this blanket ban allow activities that would be considered unacceptable by international standards. Under 14s can work in any “family or family enterprise…after school hours or during vacations,” provided the work is not hazardous and does not “affect their school education.” 
* Factory Act:
    * Indian law defines hazardous work, also banned for children 14-17 years of age, more narrowly than international law: anything involving mining, explosives and occupations mentioned in the Factory Act
* Aadhaar Act 2016:
    * In March 2016, Parliament passed the Aadhaar Act, requiring any individual receiving any subsidy, benefit or service from the Consolidated Fund of India to either provide proof of Aadhaar enrollment or, if not assigned a unique identification number, to make an application.
    * In September 2018, India’s Supreme Court ordered that Aadhaar registration is required for filing income tax returns and for access to government subsidies and welfare schemes. However, the court banned mandatory Aadhaar for nearly all other uses, including as a condition for education access, bank accounts, mobile phones or use of private services.
