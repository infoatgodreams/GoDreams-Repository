# Restoration Care Model:


* The process of reuniting a child with their family is known as restoration. 
* The right of children to not be separated from one’s family and, if separated from one’s family for whatever reasons, then their right to be restored to their family has been articulated explicitly in recent laws and instruments. 
* Unfortunately, there may be situations where the natural or extended families, and more appropriately natural parents and close natural relatives get separated from their child, or become incompetent, disinclined to provide care and protection to their child or become a source of harm to the child. In such cases, the responsibility to provide care and protection may fall on the State. This corrective measure is also called deinstitutionalization but the term describes only a part of the larger process of restoration.
* In India, the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children Act, 2015) has been guiding the rehabilitation of vulnerable children. It upholds the significance and need for children to grow up within a family environment.
* In cases of children rescued from Commercial Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking (CSE&T), after the rescue and the immediate post rescue legal protocols, the victims are temporarily sheltered in institutions or Children’s Homes (CH) as per the Orders of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) constituted under the Juvenile Justice Act 2015. 
* A child victim of commercial sexual exploitation and trafficking (CSE) can be declared a child in need of care and protection (CNCP)2 who 
    * has been or is being or is likely to be abused, tortured or exploited for the purpose of sexual abuse or illegal acts; or 
    * is being or is likely to be abused for unconscionable gains. 
* The legislation in India that primarily lays out the procedures for children in need of care and protection rudimentarily describes the responsibilities of CCI staff and CSOs towards the strengthening of the family pre and post-restoration. 
* There is a lack of knowledge on the preparation of the family for restoration and on the extent and scope of follow-up with the child post restoration. These tasks are thus often handled as per established social work practices.


# Needs Identified in the Restoration Model:

It is to be noted that sometimes, families might not be ready or equipped to identify some of the complex needs of children in need of care and protection (CNCP) such as health concerns, social protection, and economic self-reliance, etc. Thus, a lot of work is required on strengthening a family and preparing them when a care leaver or child exits the JJ system and is restored.

The needs are evolving and not meant to be exhaustive. Primarily, these focus on:
Shelter: 
    * Safety:
    * Ensuring the safety of a child victim is a challenging job in non-institutional settings like families. It is much easier to adhere to the legal guidelines of safety in formal institutional set-ups because they are well-funded, either run or monitored by the state authorities. 
    * Families on the other hand are independent units that may need assistance and support from time to time. As per the UN Guidelines for Alternative Care of Children, 2010, efforts need to focus on directing the child to remain or return to their parents, families, or guardians, when appropriate
    * A measure to assess and ensure the safety of CNCP is:
        * Social Investigation Report (SIR):
            * Typically, ‘found but untraced’ children or those whose rights seem to have been violated are produced before the CWC either by the Childline officials (a national child helpline service), police officials, or any ordinary citizen. 
            * Post the initial assessment, if the parents of the child are found, the CWC decides to place the child with the parents or guardians, until the inquiry is completed. If the parents or guardians cannot be traced, then, the child is temporarily placed in a CH, until the inquiry is completed. 
            * Often, during the period of inquiry, close relatives including the parents of the victim approach the CWC seeking the custody of the child. 
            * In such situations, it is critical to conduct a thorough assessment of the family, especially the parents, before restoring the child to them. This procedure of inquiry is called the Social Investigation and its report is called Social Investigation Report (SIR). 
            * The SIR needs to be completed within the 15 days of the CWC passing the Order, so that the CWC can pass a Final Order within four months of the first production of the child. 
            * The Social Investigation includes interacting with the child, the case worker (the CCI staff) assigned to the child, as well as the Investigating Officer (the police) and any other significant individuals such as the family and school in the case as the Committee deems relevant.
            * While the information collected and presented in the SIR is based on facts observed or recorded, there is some scope to add suggestions, recommendations, or pressing observations from the case workers
    * Care and Protection 
    * While safety has a more physical connotation of keeping the child safe, care and protection entails the socio-cultural elements of a child’s well-being.
    * Multiple aspects are covered under the care and protection, these are:
        * Immunity against re-trafficking
            * When victims are trafficked by known persons (known as acquaintances) into the sex trade, there is a possibility of the victim being sexually maltreated, intimidated, threatened, or trafficked yet again. 
            * In cases where the trafficker (or their family) is in close physical proximity to the child victim and their family, their vulnerability increases. Thus, restoring a child victim in such environments may not be safe. 
            * The child victim’s physical proximity to the trafficker needs to be assessed and considered while conducting the inquiry and making a decision for restoration
            * Case workers make the following assessments pre-restoration: 
                * Identifying the location and residence of the trafficker. 
                * Finding the current status of the trafficker or exploiter: If an offense has been registered and the trafficker is in jail, social workers follow up on the bail applications and keep the family apprised of the legal status of the case. 
                * Assessing the trafficker’s (if they have been released on bail) or their family’s (if the trafficker is in jail) behavior: There may be a possibility that the trafficker or their family may try to intimidate the victim’s family. All such relevant information is shared with the CWC to enable them to make an informed decision about the child’s care and protection. 
                * Assess the family’s capacity to manage and respond to a precipitating incident concerning the victim’s protection
            * Besides proximity to the trafficker, sometimes (especially in urban slum settlements), there might be disrupting instances and elements in the immediate social environment of the victim that might make them vulnerable to exploitation. 
            * These can include peer pressure to use or sell drugs, high incidences of sexual violence against women, poor or disintegrated social protection systems, or low vigilance by local administrators and law enforcement, etc. 
            * It is critical that a child is prepared for such social vulnerabilities during restoration.
        * Access to society and opportunities:
            * When the family is unaware of the crimes committed against their child and are made aware of the same, they might feel violated. 
            * The parents might question and re-examine their parenting style and yearn to provide a safe environment for their child. 
            * Thus, it is likely for the families to become vigilant of the child victim’s mobility and restrict their movement beyond the house and the immediate community. 
            * The stigma associated with sexual violence might also make the family overly cautious of the victim’s social interaction, including their presence online. 
            * This stigma can also make the family and victim feel distanced from their immediate social environment. These factors can adversely affect the child’s development.
            * It has been observed that a family’s over-cautious behavior can lead a child victim to internalize restrictions and confinement. To avoid the same, case workers interact with the child regularly and refer them to counselors to help them deal with their emotions.
            * Thus, following measures can be taken up by a caseworker as follow up conversations after the child is restored with the family:
                * Determine parents’ attitude towards the child’s routine movements in the community.
                * Understand the challenges of the child while moving outside their home
                * Family or parental counseling: In certain cases, the case workers may refer parents or the family for professional counseling to better equip them for creating a trustworthy environment for their child.
        * Adult supervision
            * The quality and presence of adult supervision, either parents or guardians, is critical to a child’s well-being. The absence of this supervision and guidance might result in an offense being (re)committed against the children. 
            * Thus, when a child is restored, it is essential to assess the nature of supervision available for them post-restoration.

* Health
    * Nutrition
    * Nutrition is a primary requirement for development. Children should have access to healthy, sumptuous, and nutritious food 3 to 4 times a day. The quantity of the meals depends on the child’s age and developmental stages of growth. 
    * When a child victim is in a CCI, the food and nutrition requirements are taken care of and monitored regularly as per the prescribed guidelines. 
    * However, once the child is restored to their family, the victim’s access to healthy and nutritious food needs to be assessed by the case workers through interaction and follow-ups with the family and the victim.
    * Follow-ups after restoration should focus on understanding the relevant family practices, gender, and other social biases about food and nutrition and its impact on the child’s overall growth and development.
    * Some of the good field practices post-restoration include: 
        * Assessment of the family's perception of nutritious and healthy food. 
        * Assessment of the family’s financial capacity: Case workers also assess if the family can afford healthy, nutritious meals, and help the family access free or subsidized groceries. 
        * Assessment of the family’s preferences and cultural context: Socio-cultural contexts also impact eating habits in a child.
    * **Special Nutrition**: Special nutrition might be required in cases where the child is being treated for an illness, especially deficiencies like iron, malnourishment or communicable diseases that affect immunity. In more serious infections like tuberculosis, a well-balanced, nutritious diet is a must for recovery.
    * In such cases nutrition plans are usually designed when the child victim is still at the CCI. After restoration, such plans are to be integrated by the family in the child's daily routine food intake. 
    * Hygiene:
    * This includes both external and internal (personal) hygiene practices. They are:
        * Home and Surrounding-External:
            * Cleanliness and sanitation, both within the residence and in the child victim’s immediate external environment, need to be assessed. 
            * This includes, and is not limited to, waste disposal mechanisms, usage and disposal of wastewater, access to bathrooms and toilets, and water for drinking and household purposes. 
            * Some activities for improving these hygiene conditions are:
                * Assess the challenges in accessing sanitation facilities: Sometimes, families may have to walk or wait long or odd hours to relieve themselves—which is likely to increase the possibility of sexual harassment or eve-teasing when women approach such secluded areas. 
                * Although the access to toilets and bathrooms does not determine the decision to restore a child with their family, it is an essential part of the post-restoration follow-up.
                * Discuss the challenges with relevant authorities (local CSOs, community leaders, other civic authorities) and draw up possible measures in overcoming these challenges.
        * Personal Hygiene:
            * When the victim is in the CCI, the staff helps them maintain their hygiene like cutting nails, taking a bath every day, combing hair, dressing well, and looking after their menstrual hygiene. 
            * However, these practices need to be continued once the child is restored to their family, especially in low-income, urban communities with space and resource constraints.
    * Physical health care
        * Physical health of a child is critical during post-restoration follow-up. Sometimes, medical conditions can arise once the child is restored with their family. 
        * Before a child is restored to their family, a detailed physical assessment is conducted by the CCI. If the child is undergoing treatment, the continuation of that treatment post restoration becomes an integral part of the child’s rehabilitation plan. 
        * Certified medical systems, or qualified, state authorized services recognized by the competent authorities, including super-specialized services are essential for diagnosis and treatment of the child
        * Thus, following up on a child’s health is a critical component of post restoration follow-up. Some of the best practices are: 
            * **Assess the nature of the child’s illness**: When symptoms of cold, flu, or other viral infections are observed for over a fortnight or consistently over 2 to 3 follow-up visits, case workers suggest medical intervention to the family. They also follow up on the same with the child and the family while discussing the importance of seeking medical assistance. 
            * **Connect the family with public health facilities**: If a family has had limited experience dealing with the health system, case workers provide hands-on orientation to the child and family to public health facilities like government hospitals and local health clinics. They also educate the families (may accompany to orient them in certain cases) on availing Out-Patient Department (OPD) services in government hospitals, approaching the social work department in a hospital for financial assistance, etc. 
            * **Conduct regular follow-ups**: Case workers also actively follow up with family and/or with the health facility on the treatment that is being provided to the child after restoration. 
            * **Provide financial assistance**: Sometimes, case workers also link families to medical sponsorships or referral to a private hospital or clinic pro bono depending on the family’s financial capacities
    * Mental health
        * Public awareness of mental health is extremely low, especially within low-income communities, and there is a general reluctance to approach mental health services. 
        * When a child victim is living in a CCI, they interact with a counselor. The first few months are spent on stabilizing the victim and helping them cope with unresolved thoughts and feelings. 
        * Often, a child victim may also need counseling and emotional support post-restoration to adapt to the family and society.
        * The counseling sessions focus on dealing with trauma and post-traumatic symptoms including anxiety, self -harm, psychosomatic symptoms, building resilience, dealing with society, commitment to re-integration, and developing healthy parenting techniques
* Legal 
* The socio-legal need of children is two-fold:
    * Firstly, a child rescued from commercial sexual exploitation and trafficking is a CNCP under the JJA10 and has the right to rehabilitation under the law. 
    * Secondly, under other criminal laws, there is an ongoing effort to get the offender punished for the offense of trafficking a child for commercial sexual exploitation. 
    * The child victim is entitled to assistance under both these circumstances. 
* Along with providing a child victim with relevant recovery and rehabilitation services, making victim-witness protection services available to the child is also essential and enforceable by law. 
* This section addresses two broad sub-needs: prosecution, the process in which a victim participates as the witness of the State to the crime; and care and protection, where the victim is offered the necessary rehabilitative services for eventual social reintegration.
    * Prosecution
        * In the Indian criminal justice system, heinous crimes of serious nature such as trafficking of persons for sexual exploitation are also treated as crimes against the State and not just against an individual
        * The testimony of the child victim plays an important role in establishing the narrative of the trial. The prosecution is complex and long drawn and requires the assistance of victims as witnesses to make an effective case. Thus, it is important that victims are also aided to ensure that the trial does not re-victimize and re-traumatize them. Such victim-witness protection services are especially critical for child victims of CSE.
        * Awareness and orientation of the Victim in the stages of investigation and prosecution.
            * A provision from the POCSO Act 2020 suggests the appointment of a Support Person to assist the child through the investigation and trial. The Rules further lay down the functions of the Support Person including orienting the child and explaining the role they may play in the process. 
            * POCSO Rules, 2020 also include provisions to make the child and their family aware of the services available to them, the procedural steps involved in a criminal prosecution, the status of the investigation of the crime, information on arrest and bail of the suspected offender, verdict of the trial, etc
        * Victim Assistance provided during trial:
            * The victim plays an important role in the stage of evidence during trial u/s 231 and 233 of Code of Criminal Procedures (CrPC). 
            * The victim-witness may be summoned to the court to present oral testimony to corroborate their initial statement. Generally, the victim is a prosecution witness and is subjected to cross-examination by the defense counsel.
            * To ensure that the procedures are child-friendly, the POCSOA and its Rules have also made the provisions for the trial process. 
            * These include provision of a support person assisting the child throughout the process of trial, designated Special Courts to adjudicate cases of sexual offenses against children, availability of translators and interpreters, frequent breaks for the child, and in-camera trials.
    * Care and Protection
    * The JJA 2015 aims to cater to the basic needs of CNCP by adopting a child-friendly approach to ensure proper care, protection, development, and treatment of the victims. 
    * The JJA and Rules enlist procedures to be implemented by institutions and bodies established for the same.
        * Social Investigation:
            * As previously mentioned during the need for safety. The CWC often makes use of the Social Investigation Report (SIR) to assess the situation of the child on economic, social, psychosocial and other fronts. 
            * Among other things, social investigation considers the socio-economic background of the family, understands cultural practices, if any, that could make the child vulnerable to exploitation, seeks information about the family’s financial ability to look after the child, and tries to understand if the family, in any way, benefited from the child’s exploitation. 
            * During the visit, case workers also observe the family dynamics and the parents’ understanding of the victim’s vulnerability. 
            * These observations are documented in the Social Investigation Report (SIR) as these are valuable sources of information to assess whether the family is equipped to address the child’s need for care and protection. 
            * The facts in the Social Investigation Report (SIR) along with the case workers’ observations, enable the CWC to make an informed decision about the child’s rehabilitation and restoration. 
            * The social investigation is supposed to take place immediately post the rescue, ideally within 15 days of the first production of the child before the CWC. Hence, this process is mostly completed when the child is temporarily residing at a CCI
        * Final Order: Restoration and Follow-up:
            * After the inquiry, the CWC makes an informed decision if the child should continue being rehabilitated through institutional care for a specific time period or be restored to the family. 
            * This is known as the Final Order, and the CWC is expected to pass this Order within the first four months of the first production of the child. 
            * The JJA considers restoration to be a long-term objective. The CWC may pass an Order for restoration in the longer run even though they may pass an Order for institutional care during the final order stage. 
            * The CWC may also pass an Order for CSOs/NGOs or the District Child Protection Unit (DCPU) to follow-up with the child post-restoration.
* Social Protection/Welfare Schemes
*  Social protection services are offered to the underprivileged population through identity and eligibility documents, such as a passport, ration card, or a voter ID.
    * Personal Identification & Entitlement documents
    * Personal Identification documents help in establishing one’s identity through a photograph and valid personal credentials such as an Aadhar card, a PAN card, voter ID, ration card, and Caste Certificate. 
    * They help establish an individual’s social identity and background. These documents are important for the victims of CSE as described below:
        * Aadhar Card:
            * An Aadhar card, a 12-digit number assigned to every Indian citizen, entitles an individual to many government facilities and benefits. 
            * The ID is valid across the country and is generated by collecting biometric data, including the fingerprints and retina scan, and is issued to the applicant after receiving approval from the UIDAI (Unique Identification Authority of India). 
            * The card also holds other data like the address of the cardholder and contact information. 
            * However, as per the JJA 2015, only two documents are accepted as evidence for age, and an Aadhar card is not one of these documents.
            *  However, the Aadhar Card is essential for other purposes such as opening bank accounts in case there are compensations to be paid to the victim by the state.
        * Birth Certificate:
            * The Birth Certificate is issued soon after the birth of an individual by the local panchayat or the municipal corporation. 
            * It declares the date, time, and place of birth along with the name of the individual and their parents. Registration of birth and death is mandated in India under the Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969. 
            * This is one of the essential documents treated as evidence to declare and determine the age of the victim.
            * In cases where the victim’s age cannot be determined during the rescue, the CWC orders for an age-determination test to be conducted immediately post the rescue. Once the family of a victim is traced, case workers coordinate with them to procure the birth certificate document, if possible
        * School leaving certificate/school transfer certificate (SLC/STC) or Matriculation or equivalent certificate from the concerned examination board:
            * The SLC/STC is a document generally issued by the school as and when the child is leaving or getting transferred from the said school. 
            * This certificate provides information like the date of birth, date of admission, issue date, brief conduct of the child and reason for transfer or leaving the school. 
            * It is used to determine and establish the age of the victim. 
            * Matriculation or an equivalent certificate might be accessible and available if the child has appeared for such an examination in the past. 
            * Besides this, if the victim is keen on pursuing further education, these certificates are required to follow up on the admission procedure.
        * Ration Card:
            * Ration card is an official document issued in India that makes households eligible to purchase subsidized food grains from the Public Distribution System (PDS). Besides, this document also serves as an important proof of identity and residence for the families and individuals. 
            * **Tricolor Ration Cards Scheme** with a view to curb the diversion of food grains and provide more food grains to the needy families, the State Govt. introduced Tricolour ration card scheme w.e.f. 1st May’ 99. 
            * Accordingly, three different colored ration cards are issued by states: 
                * **Yellow Ration cards** – For people living below the poverty line with an annual income up to INR 15,000. These ration cards are for obtaining various subsidies on food, fuel, and other goods. 
                * **Saffron Ration cards** – For families having annual income above INR 15,000 and below 1 lakh. 
                * **White Ration cards** – For people living above the poverty line with an annual income of above 1 lakh.
            * In order to get a ration card for a household, the individuals need one or more of the following documents: 
                * Aadhar card 
                * PAN card 
                * Income Certificate 
                * Electricity/Telephone bills 
                * Gas connection details 
                * Bank Passbook 
                * Residential proof like house-rent receipt 
                * Photographs.
* Development
    * Education
        * Education is a critical need for a child and is essential for the long-term growth and socio-economic development of individuals and family units. 
        * Article 21-A in the Constitution of India provides free and compulsory education to all children in the age group of six to fourteen years as a fundamental right. 
        * The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 (RTE), represents the consequential legislation envisaged under Article 21-A. It means that every child has a right to free and compulsory elementary education (I std to VIII std) in a neighborhood school till the completion of their elementary education. 
        * This is inclusive of children belonging to the disadvantaged group as well as children belonging to the weaker sections 
        * Individual Care Plan:
            * When a child victim is rescued and temporarily sheltered in a CCI, a preliminary assessment of the victim’s needs and skills is carried out and an Individual Rehabilitation Care Plan (ICP) is prepared to be implemented
            * If a victim expresses an interest in pursuing further formal education, the probation officer or case worker assesses the possibility of connecting the child with an educational institute (for regular schooling), distance learning programs, or open schools such as the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS), and follow-up with the child post restoration. 
            * The case worker further secures relevant documents for the enrollment process as well as engages in regular counselling with the child.
    * Skill development for employability 
        * Once victims are rescued and temporarily placed in CCIs, the duty bearers interact with the child victim to understand their case and initiate the process of preparing an ICP for their rehabilitation. 
        * An assessment is conducted to understand the basic skill sets and interests of the child victim. If the victim strongly believes that they might not be able to cope with formal education, they are assisted in taking up basic literacy programs at the CCI. 
        * An assessment of the child victim’s skills and interests is conducted, and they are enrolled in a suitable vocational training program while at the CCI. 
        * This plan needs to be integrated into the ICP and should be discussed with the family pre-restoration.
        * The most common training programs in Prerana’s experience have been associated with beauty care, stitching and advanced tailoring, computer, and language skills. 
        * The interest of the child in these vocations and trainings needs to be assessed along with the availability of a service provider. 
        * Over the last decade, the hospitality sector has emerged to be a career choice for many victims.
    * Job placement:
        * One of the most important steps to rehabilitation and reintegration is to help young adults become economically self-reliant through long-term career prospects. 
        * Vocational and livelihood training opportunities designed and provided to the victims should be aligned to the market demand. The educational qualification and aptitude of the victim should result in job placement.
        * The objective of providing vocational training is to create employability, build capacities and skills in young adults so they can secure a job and build a career. 
        * Once a young adult completes vocational training and turns 18, case workers assist them extensively in getting a job. 
            * **Networking with vocation training centers and service providers**: Case workers network with service providers for job prospects. In Prerana’s experience, this service is sometimes also extended to other individuals in the child/ young adult’s family who might be looking for job opportunities. 
            * **Networking with verified recruitment agencies**: Prerana also develops linkages with verified recruitment agencies and other retail chains or corporates to provide job opportunities for the child. Sometimes these are taken up as formal partnerships that help place the young adult in the job market on a rolling basis.
            * **Building a portfolio:** Case workers assist children in building and maintaining an online resume or profile to help them find job opportunities through verified online portals like Naukri.com. Case workers also help children send job applications and prepare for interviews. 
            * **Assisting in the process of adapting to a job**: Case workers follow up with victims even after they receive a job offer to join an organization. They help them adapt to the new environment and discuss their successes and challenges on a regular basis. They may also be linked to a peer for support especially when they are new to the job market. 
            * **Assisting victims in starting their ventures**: If victims have acquired certain skill sets and are self-driven and independent, case workers put them in touch with service providers for enterprise-building activities. This involves financial assistance as well as mentorship to ensure that they can kickstart and run their enterprise.
    * Independent living skills 
        * Independent living skills such as basic financial skills, negotiating and purchasing, cooking and managing household activities, undertaking minor repair works at home, traveling independently by using public and private transport, personal care, conflict resolutions, personal safety (offline and online), crisis management, building general awareness about social and global issues, and seeking help are essential for children and young adults for their successful reintegration into the society. It is also important that these skills are imparted to all young adults, without gender biases or patriarchal norms.
* Social Integration
    * Support Mechanisms
        * Social reintegration is the last link in the rehabilitation of child victims. The aim of social reintegration is to help a child overcome the stigma and discrimination of being a “victim”. 
        * While legal measures, social awareness and education are important, victims of CSE must also have access to counseling and training to deal with adverse and hostile social environments.
        * The assessment of the needs and sub-needs as mentioned in this document can be managed and executed through professional follow-up services for the child once they are restored to their family.
        * Currently, the JJ Act 2015 and State Rules 2018 have limited provisions for undertaking professional follow-up of child victims once they are restored to their families.
    * Stakeholder engagement
        * The scope for interaction and professional follow-up services is limited when a child victim is restored to their family due to limited access. 
        * Since these visits and calls are made over time, it becomes essential to mobilize the child victim’s immediate social environment to assist them in time of need. 
        * The immediate community involves CBOs, Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) centers or Anganwadis, community leaders, and community health centers. Sensitizing these stakeholders while maintaining confidentiality about the child’s background is critical to reach the objective of social reintegration


# Challenges of the Restoration Model:

The implementation of this restoration model faced a number challenges, such as:



* Resistance from the family post-restoration: 
    * The biggest challenge for case workers following up with child victims who’ve been restored to their families is tracing them and continuing to maintain contact over time. 
    * Court Orders or Orders from the CWC are used to inform the child victim’s family about the importance of staying in touch with the JJ system for a period of one to two years, or until the child turns 18. 
    * In Prerana’s experience, families may be willing to stay in touch with the organization only when they see the short-term benefits of the same.
* Access to unqualified, traditional health service providers: 
    * Food, nutrition, and health practices differ based on a child’s socio-cultural context and might be hard to monitor regularly. 
    * Some communities may depend on unauthorized or unlicensed medical practitioners as compared to authorized professionals even while dealing with deficiencies, diseases, or infections. 
    * It can be challenging to convince and sensitize families about the significance of seeking and continuing medical treatment
* Resistance to victim and family counseling: 
    * The stigma associated with seeking mental health assistance often keeps children and their families from approaching professionals. Even when they do participate, as mandated by the CWC, most don’t show eager participation or feedback. 
    * The counseling process is gradual and slow. Professionals take time to build rapport. The absence of quick results may demotivate a child and their family from continuing the sessions.
* Restoration directly through Court Orders: 
    * Restoration of child victims of CSE generally takes place through the CWC only after the initial due diligence. However, sometimes, families of the child victims directly approach the higher courts of law, like the Court of Sessions or move a writ of Habeas Corpus in the High Court, seeking the custody of the victims. 
    * During such times, when the courts make these decisions of restoring child victims without considering the say of the CWCs who have conducted the on-ground inquiry, restoration might prove counterproductive to the rehabilitation and eventual reintegration of the victim.
* Lack of sustainable economic rehabilitation: 
    * In some cases, child victims find it very difficult to stay in a job beyond a couple of weeks. They may find it hard to adjust to strict rules, feel exhausted from over-working, end up in hostile work environments with strict supervision, or suffer from health issues. Sometimes perpetrators can also reach out to them at their workplaces.
* Reduced contact of the case worker with the child once they are restored: 
    * When a child is in a CCI, their regular contact with the case worker helps them stay motivated. When they are restored into society, their contact with the case worker may be limited. 
    * Case workers also have significantly reduced access to the child and their day-to-day engagements. Hence, the scope and impact of enabling a positive environment for the child is limited.


# Important Acts mentioned in the model:



* The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children Act, 2015): 
    * The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children Act, 2015 has been guiding the rehabilitation of vulnerable children. It upholds the significance and need for children to grow up within a family environment.
* The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2020 (POCSOA): 
    * Given the sensitive nature of sexual offenses against children and keeping in mind the traumatized mental state of children, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2020 (POCSOA) has mandated child-friendly procedures in law. These provisions are also extended to Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Rules, 2020 (POCSO Rules, 2020). 
* The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 (RTE): 
    * It represents the consequential legislation envisaged under Article 21-A. It means that every child has a right to free and compulsory elementary education (I std to VIII std) in a neighborhood school till the completion of their elementary education. 
* Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969:
    * Registration of birth and death is mandated in India under the Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969.
