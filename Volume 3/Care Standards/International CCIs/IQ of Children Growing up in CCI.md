# Brief:

* Scope & Description: In this meta-analysis of 75 studies on more than 3,888 children in 19 different countries, the intellectual development of children living in children’s homes (orphanages) was compared with that of children living with their (foster) families. Children growing up in children’s homes showed lower IQ’s than did children growing up in a family (trimmed d = 0.74). The age at placement in the children’s home, the age of the child at the time of assessment, and the developmental level of the country of residence were associated with the size of the delays.

# Intellectual Development of children in orphanages: 

* Intellectual development of children growing up in orphanages is thought to be at risk.
* ## Probable reasons for delayed brain development in orphanages:
    * A few reasons for such a risk and the possibility of delayed brain development during the formative period after birth (Chugani et al., 2001; Gunnar, Bruce, & Grotevant, 2000; Johnson, 2000; Miller, 2005; Van IJzendoorn & Juffer, 2006) are:
    * ### Care in large groups:
        * In a groundbreaking intervention study, Groark, Muhamedrahimov, Palmov, Nikiforova, and McCall (2005) demonstrated that promoting caregiver sensitivity leads to better socioemotional and cognitive development of the children involved and a better atmosphere in the groups consisting of children of differing ages. 
        * Caregiver-child ratio might also be important. Groark and colleagues (2005) managed to decrease the number of children per caregiver, which promoted children’s development significantly.
        * Children with the most favorable caregiver-child ratio (maximally three children per caregiver) did not significantly lag behind their peers reared in families. This means that in residential care with small groups intellectual development of the pupils may not lag behind substantially.
    * ### Poor environments: 
        * In less-developed countries the discrepancies between the IQ of residential and family-reared children was indeed largest. 
        * In the latter countries the IQ delays were negligible, perhaps because of the extreme poor living conditions for both categories of children (family reared and orphanage-reared) in those African countries. 
        * Wolff (1995) even suggested that in Eritrea children living in orphanages were better off than children reared by their parents. 
        * Similarly, Kodero (2001) found that AIDS/HIV orphans in Kenya received better care in children’s homes than in other forms of care, including care by the extended family.
    * ### Lack of challenging stimuli:
        * The stimulus deprivation theory (Casler, 1961) suggests that the lack of physical and social stimuli of any kind may be the most important cause of intellectual delays, and enriching the orphanage environment would result in better intellectual development. 
        * Cognitive stimulation may be another important factor in children’s homes. Morison, Chisholm, and Ames (1995) showed that with an increasing amount of play materials, developmental delays decreased in children adopted from orphanages (see also Kaler & Freeman, 1994).
    * ### Lack of stable attachments
        * The maternal deprivation concept (Bowlby, 1951) states that a stable and continuous attachment relationship with a sensitive caregiver is essential for socioemotional as well as for intellectual development. 
        * If this is true, children’s homes with more sensitive caregivers and smaller groups might be less damaging to intellectual development.
    * ### Age of children and duration of stay:
        * Age of the children and the duration of their stay in the orphanage may also play a role in the degree to which group care affects children’s intellectual development. One would expect that younger entry into the orphanage (Sloutsky, 1997) and a longer stay (Sloutsky, 1997; Spitz, 1945) would be more detrimental, but the evidence is equivocal

## Impact of Institutionalisation on Child Development
- Dennis found that at age 11, the average IQ of the adopted children was within the range of normally developing children, whereas the nonadopted orphans were diagnosed as mentally retarded. 
- In a meta-analysis on six studies, including 253 participants, we found strong evidence for Dennis’s finding, as the adopted children outperformed their siblings or peers left behind in terms of their performance on an IQ test with more than one standard deviation across studies (Van IJzendoorn & Juffer, 2005; Van IJzendoorn, Juffer, & Klein Poelhuis, 2005).
* Between 1930 and 1950 the first wave of studies documented that children in orphanages often showed a low IQ and severe language delays (Crissey, 1937; Durfee & Wolf, 1933). 
* In later studies similar delays were observed in the intellectual as well as the socio emotional domains of development (Ainsworth, 1962; Bowlby, 1952; Ferguson, 1966; Freud & Burlingham, 1944; Provence & Lipton, 1962; Rheingold, 1956; Schaffer, 1965; Skeels, 1966; Spitz, 1945; Yarrow, 1961).
* Recent research keeps showing the continuing negative influence of residential care on children’s development (Ahmad & Mohamad, 1996; Harden, 2002; Sloutsky, 1997; Sparling, Dragomir, Ramey, & Florescu, 2005; St. Petersburg-USA Orphanage Research Team, 2005; Vorria et al., 2003; Yagmurlu, Berument, & Celimli, 2005; Zeanah, Smyke, Koga, & Carlson, 2005).
* Adoption may recover the IQ delays and increase the IQ of children who lived in institutions before being adopted. In the same vein, Zeanah and his colleagues (2003) found in a randomized intervention study that foster care increases developmental prospects of children from institutional care substantially. 
* Most importantly, environmental interventions within children’s homes (e.g., Hakimi-Manesh et al., 1984; Groark et al., 2005; Spira et al., 2000) have shown large positive effects on children’s IQ as well, thus indicating that regular orphanages provide suboptimal care 


# Intellectual development of children raised in orphanages vs. in families:

* In the current study when they compared the absolute IQs and DQs of the two groups, the children reared in orphanages showed on average an IQ/DQ of 84.40 (SD = 16.79, N = 2,311, k = 47); the average IQ/DQ of children raised in families was 104.20 (SD = 12.88, N = 456, k = 16). 
* This difference of almost 20 IQ points was significant (t = 3.58, p &lt; .01). Children growing up in children’s homes showed a substantial delay in intellectual development, amounting to more than one standard deviation.
* Possible moderating factors for substantial delay in intellectual development for children reared in orphanages are:
    * ### Gender:
        * Gender did not appear to be a significant moderator; whether the studies included only males or only females did not yield different effect sizes (Q[df= 1] = 0.07, p = .80).
    * ### Age of children:
        * At the time of assessment:
            * Children from orphanages assessed before 4 years of age performed less well compared with children assessed after their fourth birthday. 
        * At the time of entry to the orphanage:
            * Age at entry into the children’s home was also a relevant moderator. Children placed into the orphanage before 12 months of age did less well than their peers reared in families, and this delay was significantly larger than with children who entered the orphanage after 12 months ([d = 1.10, k = 24, and d = –0.01, k = 9], Q[df = 1] = 13.00, p = &lt; .001).
        * Children who were younger at assessment and those who were younger at placement in the orphanage appeared to lag behind more than did their older peers. 
        * This may be due to the pre-placement experiences with a more stimulating family life of those children who entered orphanages at a later stage. 
        * One or two years of family life in infancy may provide a (relatively) firm basis for further intellectual development, even when children have to grow up in a poor environment of group care later on. But longer stay in the orphanage was not always most detrimental
        * An explanation may be that:
            * The children who had stayed for more than four years in an orphanage consisted of a group of stronger (and maybe more intelligent) children who had survived institutional care. 
            * Several authors (e.g., Dennis et al., 1957; Johnson, 2004; Miller, 2005, p. 27) documented that children suffer alarmingly high death rates in their first year of institutionalisation and that for a long time high mortality rates in orphanages were not at all exceptional. 
            * Another explanation may be that older children in children’s homes start attending playgroups or school, which may boost their IQs (Aboud et al., 1991).
    * ### Caregiver-child ratio:
        *  Characteristics of the children’s homes. Differences in caregiver-child ratio between the orphanages were not significantly related to differences in effect sizes.
    * ### Socioeconomic level of development of the country of origin:
        * Socioeconomic level of development of the country of origin made a difference. The HDI showed a significant overall contrast. 
        * More specifically, contrasting the countries with a high HDI versus countries with a lower HDI, we found that the test for a difference in combined effect sizes related to the studies conducted in those two sets of countries became significant as well (Q[df= 1] = 5.08, p = .02).
        * It should be noted that the three lowest-scoring countries (Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Kenya) showed no discrepancy between family-reared and institutionalised children


# Limitations of this research:

* Heterogeneous effect size:
    * The collected empirical studies appear to have produced rather heterogeneous effect sizes, and we were obliged to apply the more conservative approach of the random effects model that takes this heterogeneity into statistical account. 
    * We argue that this heterogeneity is not caused by the domain of study: 
        * We selected only research on intellectual development in the strict sense, as defined by the use of IQ tests such as Raven’s Matrices (Raven, 1958) or similar instruments such as the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (Bayley, 1993). 
        * We also left out studies on other dimensions of cognitive development (language, school achievement, meta-cognition) because too few studies were done to include them in a meta-analysis. 
    * Research on children in orphanages is difficult to conduct, which is the reason why we found relatively many missing data (on age of entry, duration of stay, caregiver-child ratio) that limited the use of (multivariate) analyses.
* Use of Western IQ tests:
    * Another limitation is the use of Western IQ tests (A list of these tests is in the Table 1 below)  in a non-Western setting in many of the studies included in the current meta-analyses. MacLean (2003) suggested that the measures developed in another culture might have a poor fit with the new populations in which they are used and might lead to underachievement in these groups
    * Thus, comparing the institutionalised children’s IQ with an average IQ of a measure that has not been updated during the last 10 or even 20 years may underestimate their intellectual delays (O’Connor et al., 2000). 
    * A list of such tests of IQ measurements are: [[Assessment Tools]]
        * Raven's Matrices
        * WISC
        * Hetzer-Bühler
        * Griffiths
        * Gesell Schedules
        * Bayley Scales
        * Cattell test
        * SON
        * Stanford-Binet
        * Uzgiris-Hunt
        * Gesell/Kuhlmann Merrill-Palmer
        * Denver II test
        * Battelle
        * Minnesota
    * A last limitation is the correlational nature of the primary studies as well as the current meta-analysis that precludes causal inferences. 
    * We are inclined to attribute the IQ delays between children in orphanages and children reared at home to the detrimental effects of the institutional group care setting. 
    * However, we cannot exclude the alternative hypothesis that children with lower IQ scores might be sent to orphanages more often as they may require more resources and special care than is available in their extended family. 
    * The absence of an effect for length of stay in the children’s home on IQ delays might be interpreted as an argument against the detrimental (dose-response) effects of orphanages.
