# Brief:

* Scope & Description: The study aims to explore the experiences of Ghanaian care leavers to discern the factors that promote and impede their educational attainment. Data was collected from 23 care leavers using semi-structured interviews. The findings suggest that the personal motivation of the care leavers and encouragement from significant adults and peers facilitated their academic success. However, the participants identified stigma, lack of academic support, and the inability to participate in decisions as barriers to their education.

# Understanding Academic Attainment in Children in care: 

* According to Sandberg (2018), a key responsibility of States to children in the formal alternative care system is to ensure that they have access to quality education. 
* The United Nations Guidelines for Alternative Care stipulates that children in care have a right to educational and vocational training as part of their preparation for adulthood (United Nations General Assembly, 2010). 
* Extant research has shown that there is a positive association between care leaver’s educational attainment, notably higher education qualifications, and their outcomes in health, employment, income, and housing.
* ## According to Mendes et al. (2014), certain pre-care, in-care, and aftercare factors facilitate or hinder care leavers’ educational attainment. 
    * Pre-care:
        * Many children, before they enter care, lag behind their peers academically because they have special educational needs due to their experiences of abuse, mental health issues, or disability. 
        * In many African countries such as Cote D’Ivoire, many vulnerable children who enter care, including orphans and those living with a disability, are often excluded from education because of poverty, the need for labor or parental sickness or death
    * In-care:
        * Many young people in care experience frequent placement moves, affecting their school attendance and performance. 
        * Also, carers and school teachers often have low expectations for young people in care and thus do not encourage them to pursue higher education 
        * In developing countries, a significant obstacle to the education of children and young people in care is the financing arrangements of residential care facilities. Most facilities depend heavily on funding from donors and volunteers (Keshavarzian & Borgstr€om, 2020). While funds from donors allow the facilities to educate the children, it has its challenges 
        * In India, young people in care often have to opt for vocational courses because the institutions have difficulty finding donors to fund expensive courses like medicine (Azam et al., 2019). 
        * In addition, a growing phenomenon in Africa and Asia is orphanage tourism, where tourists and volunteers are allowed to visit and stay in care facilities for a fee or donation (Richter & Norman, 2010). However, some activities of the visitors disrupt the children’s education. For instance, the children sometimes miss school to rehearse and undertake performances to entertain donors visiting the residential facility (Islam, 2013). 
        * In countries such as Bangladesh, Botswana and India, young people in or from residential care indicate facing stigma from school teachers and schoolmates because of their care or orphan background
    * Aftercare: 
        * Many young people have difficulty persisting with their education after leaving care. 
        * Most African countries lack statutory after-care services and support for care leavers. 
        * Without support, many care leavers in India, Zimbabwe, and Philippines face financial difficulties and the pressure to earn an income which forces them to postpone their education


# Facilitators of Academic success:

* The factors identified in various studies as contributing to the educational success of care leavers include:
    * resourcefulness and motivation, 
    * having key adults who provide guidance and encouragement, 
    * financial and practical support, 
    * and participation in extracurricular activities.
* In several developed countries, policies such as the UK’s Children’s and Families Act, 2014, have emerged over the years to address the academic needs of children in care and care leavers (Geiger & Beltran, 2017). These policies have put in place academic (e.g., virtual school) and financial support (e.g., tuition waivers) that seek to improve the educational outcomes of care leavers
* Care leavers in many developing countries highlight the access to education as a positive feature of care. Islam (2013) argues that the positive experience is because, in Bangladesh and other developing countries, education is often viewed as a primary function of residential care as it is a vehicle for the social improvement of children who are in care mainly because of poverty. 
* Thus, compared to their pre-care lives often characterised by poverty and homelessness, the well-run facilities provide the stability for the young people to attend school
* Key factors that facilitate academic success are:
    * ## Personal Motivation
        * According to the participants, having personal motivation is an important part of academic success. Their narrations suggest that despite the challenges they experienced pre-care and in-care, they had the conviction to succeed academically to make their future better 
        * A deeper analysis of the data revealed that Hilda and the other participants who progressed to higher education mostly entered care after 5 years and because of poverty. 
        * Having experienced disruptions to their schooling, they saw care as an opportunity to get an education and a “better life”, something that they would not have gotten if they had stayed with their parents or extended families
        * However, after leaving care, some of them realized the value of education after they struggled to find employment. Instead of giving in to the challenges they were facing, they devised strategies to enable them continue their education. They saved to raise the money that they needed for school or found support from informal sources such as their intimate partners.
    * ## Encouragement from Adults and Peers
        * Aside from the personal resources, the young people in the study also suggest that support from carers and other significant adults facilitated their academic progress
        * It is therefore probable that those who had poor educational experiences and who were having difficulties after leaving care are underrepresented in this study.
        * The findings seem to suggest a link between the care leaver’s educational achievement and staff members’ expectations and attitudes. From the accounts of the young people, having a significant adult who took an interest in their academic work boosted their confidence and determination to succeed, echoing the findings in other studies. 
        * Several participants mentioned that the encouragement and support from adults and their peers served as an important facilitator to their academic success. 
        * The adults, often their immediate carers and teachers, pushed them to do well in school and believed in their potential, which showed through their actions. According to the participants, the encouragement and advice from these adults helped them realize the importance of education
        * Aside from the encouragement and motivation, the adults provided practical support that helped many of the care leavers with their education. 
        * The adults attended school events, contacted their teachers regularly to enquire about their progress, and used their own money to pay the school fees for some of the participants after they had left care
        * Others received support and motivation from informal sources such as their biological relatives
        * Another youth also explained that he was motivated to study harder and stay in school because his peers in care who attended university became his role models


# Barriers to Academic Achievement

* Evidence from Ghanaian care-leaving research suggests that many young people who leave care experience challenges with employment, housing, and social integration (Frimpong-Manso, 2018). 
* The care leavers who have good outcomes are often those who have the opportunity to stay longer in care to finish their education and also have financial and material support from the residential facility after leaving care (Frimpong-Manso, 2018).
* Key factors that act as barriers to Academic Achievement are:
    * ## Lack of Educational Support and Guidance:
        * Staff’s low expectations and lack of belief in their academic potential had negative consequences for the young people’s educational outcomes, as they did little to promote their aspiration for higher education. 
        * An interesting finding from this study is that for some of the young people, the extremely high expectations of the staff members also had a negative influence on their education. 
        * Because, as revealed by other research (e.g., Murayama et al., 2016), the unrealistic expectations of adults put undue pressure on young people. This contributed to them experiencing low self-esteem and eventual disengagement from school
        * Many of the young people who took part in the study suggested that an impediment to their education was the lack of support to compensate for their pre-care losses. 
        * Many of them had never or hardly attended school before entering care. However, despite this disadvantage, they felt that they did not get enough guidance and mentoring from their carers and teachers. 
        * Most of the staff paid little attention to their studies or had difficulty helping with subjects such as maths or science
        * Several of the participants also reiterated that adults in the children’s homes often had low expectations and aspirations for those who were academically weak. 
        * The staff gave them little motivation and encouragement to excel. According to the young people, these attitudes undermined their self-belief and contributed to their underachievement in school.
        * The participants reiterated that those considered academically weak, especially the females, were advised by the staff of the children’s homes to shelve their higher educational aspirations in favor of lower courses such as vocational training, even if that was not what they wanted to do
        * The participants from one of the residential facilities revealed that the overly high expectations of the staff affected their academic progress negatively. 
        * They pointed out that the staff pushed them to attend the international college owned by the residential facility, even when they did not satisfy the admission criteria. 
        * However, some young people struggled to cope with the academic work and failed several of their courses, leading to their dismissal from the college and ending their schooling
        * Previous Ghanaian research (Darkwah et al., 2016) shows that staff in residential facilities generally have low academic qualifications and minimal on-the-job training, which probably contributed to their failure to assess the young people’s academic competence or give them academic support outside school hours.
    * ## Non-participation in Educational Decisions
        * Children in care are not consulted or given opportunities to communicate their views on decisions. Without their participation, the young people end up in courses that they have little interest in or ability to pursue, leading to many dropping out or struggling to attain good qualifications. 
        * Like other existing research (Berridge, 2017; Wilson et al., 2019), care leavers in this study have the desire to have some control over their education. 
        * The inability to do so is a denial of their rights that are enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child and recommended by the Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children. 
        * Enabling children to take part in decisions helps professionals to identify their needs and improves their self-esteem and confidence
        * From the accounts of almost all the young people, the staff in the orphanages mostly decided on their education and career, including making choices about schools and courses, without consulting them or explaining the reasons. 
        * The young people then felt pressured to accept the decisions with little consideration given to their wishes
        * Many of the participants felt that the decisions and advice given by some staff were poor and not always in their best interest. The young people felt disempowered and disoriented by the decisions they disagreed with but forced to accept. This included not being allowed to attend their preferred school or doing the course that they wanted. 
        * Those who did not do well in school and those who did not continue with their education blamed it on not having an interest in what they were forced to study
        * The youth felt that while the staff might have had good intentions when they made choices about their education, it would have been better if they had consulted them, given them reasons behind the decisions made, or opportunities to share their opinions
        * As far as personal decision-making was concerned, the young people display agency in identifying personal challenges, and then planning and implementing solutions.
    * ## Stigma
        * Stigma emerged from the study as a barrier to academic progress. Negative comments from teachers and schoolmates because of their care background made school unlikable for many of the young people in the study. These experiences of stigma resulted in some even dropping out, disrupting their education 
        * However, similar to studies from Wales (Mannay et al., 2017), the practices of some residential care facilities and schools intended to aid their academic work rather generated some of the stigma the young people experienced in school
        * Some of the interviewees mentioned that they experienced stigma in school, which impeded their academic progress. According to them, certain organizational policies intended to assist them rather became a source of stigma. 
        * For example, though they did not want people to find out they were living in a children’s home, being taken to school in the institution’s bus revealed their care status
        * The young people who attended school in their children’s home suggested that the activities of their instructors led to feeling stigmatized. 
        * Dora said, “The teachers referred to children from the children’s home as ‘our children,’ and they also separated our exam results from those of the other students.” 
        * Many of the participants indicated that once their mates found out they were from the children’s home, they experienced different forms of stigma, discrimination and social exclusion


# Recommendations for Improving Academic Attainment in Children in Care:

* Obtaining a representative sample:
    * It is therefore probable that those who had poor educational experiences and who were having difficulties after leaving care are under-represented in this study
* Training for staff in the residential care facilities:
    * The training should guide staff on the best ways to ensure child participation based on their age and maturity, such as having a suggestions box, a panel with representatives elected by the children, and regular house meetings through which the children can express their opinions. 
    * As much as possible, in every decision involving the choice of schools and courses, the young person involved must be consulted, informed and made to express their wishes and be given appropriate information that they understand. 
* Having on-site educational psychologists:
    * The residential facilities should have an educational psychologist or trained educationist present who can assist the staff to assess the educational capabilities and needs of the children when they are placed in care. The assessment should then form the basis of an educational plan.
* Have on-site trained teachers:
    * As suggested by the young people, the residential facilities should acquire the services of a trained teacher who would provide remedial classes for those whose pre-care education is disrupted, and also assist the children with their homework, especially courses such as maths and science
* Encouraging and supporting children in car by the staff:
    * Through participation in such activities, the children can meet adults outside of the care system who can become mentors who could stimulate their desire to learn and aspire for higher education. 
* Having role models:
    * Care leavers who are successful academically can be encouraged to become role models for the children and youth still in care. 
* Reducing changes of stigma:
    * Lastly, teachers and residential care staff should make a conscious effort to ensure that strategies they put in place to help the education of children and young people in care must not highlight the differences between them and other children in the general population to curb the labeling and stigma they experience in school.
