# Brief:

- Scope & Description: This study with 1551 children from ages 3 months to 5 years 11 months entering Polinksy Children's Center addresses gaps in the literature concerning the physical, developmental, and mental health needs of young children placed in different care settings, namely out-of-home care with nonrelative foster parents, out-of-home kinship care with relatives, and in-home care with biological parents. It also illustrates a need for standardised assessment criteria, particularly for developmental and mental health status, and for collaborative care models for all young children entering the child welfare system, regardless of their placement following investigation.

# Conditions of children entering out-of-home care:

- Overall, the largest age group in child welfare (30%) is composed of children younger than 5 years of age. Infants and toddlers, who are dependent on the care of others during a critical phase of brain development, are especially vulnerable to both the experience and consequences of maltreatment and are the most rapidly expanding age group entering child welfare.
- **Physical Health:** Most research examining the needs of children in child welfare has focused on children placed in out-of-home care with nonrelative caregivers. Studies assessing the physical health of these children suggest that nearly all (87 to 95%) enter out-of-home care with at least one physical health problem and that a majority (50 to 60%) enter with multiple physical needs.
- **Developmental Delay** : Studies indicate that developmental delays are also extremely common among children younger than the age of 5 years in out-of-home care, with estimated rates of children exhibiting some developmental delay ranging from 13 to 62%, compared with the prevalence of delay in the general pediatric population (4â€“10%).
- **Mental Health** : Mental health problems among children in out-of-home care are similarly pervasive, having been detected in 48 to 80% of these children, compared with the 10% community based rate; these problems include high rates of comorbidity (up to 50%) with other psychological disturbances.

# Conditions of children after entering out of home care setting

## Physical health:

  - 86.7% of all children studied demonstrated needs, with more than half of the children displaying two or more problems such as:
    - **Dermatological Infections** : The body system problem with the highest occurrence of diagnoses was dermatologic, with 66.5% (1026 children) of the sample exhibiting atopic or infectious dermatitis.
    - **The respiratory system:** It had the next highest occurrence of diagnoses, with 22.6% (348) of the sample demonstrating a respiratory problem, primarily asthma.
    - **Dental** : Dental caries were found in 13.2% (204) of the sample.
    - **Haematological problems** were also prevalent, with 7.4% (114) receiving a diagnosis of anaemia. Both neurological findings and anaemia were documented more commonly in children returning to biological parents or placed in nonrelative foster care as compared with children placed in kinship care.

## Developmental delay:

  - High risk of developmental delay was observed across all initial placement types. More than half of the children had a supect score on the Denver Developmental Screening Test II (Denver-II); 
  - 70.3% of children with suspect scores were found to have mild or severe delay on more thorough developmental evaluations. Chi-square analysis indicated that children placed in nonrelative foster care were more likely to have suspect scores than children placed in other settings. As with the Denver-II, results of the Bayley-II demonstrated a high risk of developmental delay across all initial placement settings.
  - As with the results of the Denver-II and the Bayley-II, rates of delay as measured by the Stanford-Binet IV (SB-IV) were high, suggesting a high risk of developmental delay across all initial placement settings.

## Mental Health:

  - 8.7% of the sample were diagnosed with one or more mental health conditions. Rates of mental health problems reported were more comparable with reports in community samples than rates in children in foster care
  - The most common diagnoses were adjustment disorder (1.2%, n = 19), ADHD (1.1%, n = 17), and other disruptive disorders (1.1%, n = 17). Another 7.8% (120) were recommended for a more indepth mental health consult.

# Tools used to measure these conditions: [[Assessment Tools]]

## Health and Human Services Agency's Data Information system:

- To measure sociodemographic characteristics of the children, details from the Health and Human Services Agency's data information system was obtained. It consisted of age, gender, primary language, race/ethnicity, reason for removal, and initial placement type. Seven categories were used to describe reason for removal:
	  - sexual abuse,
	  - physical abuse,
	  - emotional abuse,
	  - child neglect,
	  - caregiver absence,
	  - change of placement,
	  - other, including exploitation (e.g., using a child to beg for money) and out-of-town inquiries (e.g., a child from Mexico living in the San Diego area needing child welfare services).

## Medical Charts at Polinsky:

The physical health and mental health status data were abstracted from these charts.

  - **Physical health** : The body systems section of the medical record grouped potential health problems under the following proscribed categories: dermatologic, respiratory, digestive, ear, eye, endocrine, musculoskeletal, neurological, mental health, cardiac, hematologic, reproductive, urinary, toxic syndromes, in utero exposure, toxic screen results, nonaccidental trauma, birth history, metabolic/ nourishment, systemic infections
  - **Mental health** : Seven types of mental health disturbances were specified on the standardized intake form in the chart: attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism/ pervasive developmental disorder, depression, oppositional defiant disorder, adjustment disorder, disruptive disorder, and others
-
## Denver Developmental Screening Test II (Denver II):

The Denver-II was used to screen all children entering Polinsky for developmental delay. This tool can be used to screen children from birth to 6 years of age and includes 125 items in four sections: Personal-Social, Language, Fine Motor-Adaptive, and Gross Motor. It was used by the DSEP program for three reasons.

  - First, it is primarily observatory and includes few parent/caregiver report items, which is important in a setting like Polinsky where parental report is not available.
  - Second, it spans the age range of interest, allowing for use of a single screening tool for all children under age 6 years.
  - Last, it is often used by health care clinicians, including those conducting the physical examination at Polinsky before the implementation of the DSEP program. (Note: All screeners were formally trained to administer the Denver-II in 1998 or during their first week of employment at Polinsky and attended periodic retraining workshops to ensure standard test administration).
-
## Bayley Scales of Infant Development II (Bayley-II):

The Bayley-II36 was used to evaluate children ages 0 to 42 months on three scales of development: mental, motor, and behavior.

-
## Stanford-Binet IV (SB-IV):

The SB-IV was developed to evaluate cognitive development for ages 2 years through adulthood and measures four areas: verbal reasoning, abstract/visual reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and short-term memory.


# Gaps in out-of-home care settings:

## Comprehensive physical, developmental, and mental health evaluations:

  - Young children removed from their homes are at high risk of physical health and developmental problems. One recent study documented that fewer than half of child welfare agencies provide comprehensive physical, developmental, and mental health evaluations for children entering out-of-home care.
  - This type of endeavor requires a revision of current child welfare practices, with a specific focus on health, developmental, and mental health needs added to the mandate to protect the safety and emotional well-being of children investigated for possible abuse and neglect.
-
## Need for Screening and Assessment programs:

  - The screening and assessment programs must target all young children removed from their homes on allegations of abuse or neglect, regardless of the initial placement that a child experiences.
  - Mechanisms need to be put into place to ensure that these children are assessed, information is shared with responsible adults in their lives (biological parents, kin, nonrelative caregivers, social workers, health care professionals, intervention services), and children with need are linked to all appropriate services, including early intervention services.
-
## Role of Primary care clinicians:

  - The current American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines recommend that clinicians be aware of the unique health-related needs of children entering the child welfare system.
  - Pediatric clinicians caring for high risk populations will need to display vigilance in tracking the developmental and mental health of these children. Particularly concerning are children returned to their home of origin who may receive little if any ongoing monitoring from child welfare.
-
## Public policyâ€“related research questions:

  - Child welfare systems have begun to partner with community agencies and professional organizations to develop assessment programs for children placed in nonrelative foster care; some of these approaches have been described in a recent study commissioned by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau
-
## Lack of available literature:

  - Although studies of research-based intervention programs have been shown to be effective in addressing the needs of young children with histories of alleged abuse and neglect, there have been limited studies conducted examining the effectiveness of available community-based early intervention and mental health services.

# Important Acts for child welfare:

- ## Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA)
Recent federal amendments to the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) in 2003 recommend that states enhance collaboration among public health agencies, child welfare, and community programs to address the comprehensive health and developmental needs of young children who are victims of alleged abuse and neglect and are active to the child welfare system
-
- ## The Adoption and Safe Families Act (1997):
It stressed the importance of placing children in their home of origin while receiving child welfare services, and family preservation has become the preferred placement option within the child welfare system.
