# Brief:

## Scope & Description: 
The paper reviews the development of children residing in institutions in the Russian Federation or placed with families in the USA and the Russian Federation. The paper focuses on the role of early caregiver-child interactions and how inadequate interactions could hamper social skills, cognitive development, and physical growth in children’s development.

##  General Research Approaches and Themes

Studies of children who have experienced early institutionalization represent four general research approaches: 

* assessments of infants and young children residing in institutions; 
* assessments of children who resided in institutions and were subsequently placed into families** (i.e., post-institutionalized PI children)
* assessments of infants and young children who experienced interventions designed to improve institutional care or provide high-quality family care
* follow-up assessments of children who experienced these interventions after having been placed into families.


## Children’s Experiences Prior to Placement in an Institution


* Children in the three targeted institutions arrived at the institutions   between 1 and 39 months of age.
* The children brought to the institutions had higher rates of perinatal complications (e.g., preterm birth, low birth weight) and were smaller physically than is typical of Russian births. The prevalence of evidence suggests that these perinatal factors can influence the development of children in residence in an institution, but they have not been demonstrated to be consistent major contributors to PI children’s development. 


## Care in the institutions


* These institutions had large group sizes (11–13 children per group), high children-to-caregiver ratios (6–8:1 during waking hours), homogeneous ages and disability status within a group, and periodic transitions of children from one group of peers and caregivers to another. A single child would have about 12 caregivers per week and 60–100 over the course of 2 years; caregivers worked for 24 hours and then were off for 72 h so a child did not see the same caregivers 2 days in a row. 
* Caregivers received little training, and most of their training pertained to routine caregiving and basic physical health. Caregivers rarely initiated or maintained reciprocal social interactions with children or provided physical affection. Instead, caregivers used directive language and focused on providing the necessities (feeding, changing diapers, bathing) in a business-like manner with little eye contact, talking, or playing. Thus, although the physical resources were adequate in these institutions, children had few warm, sensitive, and responsive interactions with a few consistent caregivers


## Institutionalized Children’s Development


* The infants and young children in these institutions were markedly delayed in their physical growth and cognitive/ behavioral development .
* Specifically, more than one-third of children fell below the 10th percentile of Russian standards for height, weight, and head circumference. 
* However, weight-relative-to-height was less deficient, consistent with the adequate nutrition provided, suggesting that a large part of the delayed physical growth was not obviously related to malnutrition. According to the psychosocial short stature hypothesis, children reared in inadequate social and emotional environments will have poor physical growth.
* In terms of general cognitive and behavioral development, 68% of resident children scored below the 10th percentile on a USA standardized developmental assessment. Poor performance occurred on all subscales including cognitive, language, adaptive, motor development, and especially pronounced on the personal-social behavior subscale.
* In addition, 85% of a sub-sample of children 11.5–18 months of age were classified as having disorganized attachment to their caregiver. In general, 9 out of 10 children reared from birth in families would be more advanced developmentally than the average institution-reared child. 

## The Development of Post‑institutionalized Children Adopted into Families in the USA


### Method of Data Collection:

* In 2001, 2003, 2008, and 2010, questionnaires were mailed to all the adoptive parents on the mailing list of a USA-based adoption agency specializing in placing Russian children primarily. 
*  This represents one of the largest samples of PI children in the literature (total N=1473 children), especially adopted from one country.
*  Parent reports on these questionnaires were the primary means of data collection.
*  A sub-sample of children completed direct assessments of cognitive development and executive function. 


### Emotional and Behavioral Problems



* Results indicated that PI children adopted before 18 months did not have higher than expected rates or levels of emotional or behavioral problems.
* However, PI children adopted after 18 months had significantly higher rates and levels of such problems, and the rate of longer-term problems increased rather precipitously at an age-at-adoption of 18 months.
* PI children assessed in adolescence had the highest levels of problems. This was true across all subscales of the CBCL [Child Behavior Checklist], with the highest rates for attention and externalizing problems. 
* The rates of borderline and clinical scores for older-adopted children ranged from approximately 25–50%. 
* Further, older-adopted PI children tended to display extreme scores simultaneously on several CBCL subscales and a factor analysis revealed that most CBCL subscales (except Attention Problems) loaded on one factor. This suggests the possibility of a single mechanism underlying the development of persistent behavior problems, perhaps the neurobiological consequences of chronic stress in the institution. 


### Social Skills and Perceived Relationship Quality



* Parents also reported on the social skills of 341, 5- to 19-year-old PI children using the Social Skills Rating System. Similar to the results for behavior problems, social skills were worse for later-adopted children, and the relation was again a step-like increase at an age-at-adoption of 18 months.
* Further, social skills were quite good among elementary-school-aged PI children relative to USA never-institutionalized children; but secondary school-aged PI females had significantly poorer social skills than non-PI children. 
* Again, problems seemed to occur more frequently during adolescence for later-adopted PI children. 
* Ten to seventeen-year-old PI children (N=91) rated the quality of their relationships with their mothers, siblings, and best friends. Again, children adopted after 18 months of age had poorer perceived relationship quality and more negative interactions with siblings and friends than those adopted before 18 months. Interestingly, this was not true if the PI child had an older sibling of the same gender. This latter result suggests that it may be helpful for the adoptive family to have older same-sexed children, adopted or biological, presumably to help socialize the adopted child into the family. 


### Executive Function



* Parents of 418, 2- to 18-year-old PI Russian children reported on their children’s executive functioning using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning (BRIEF).
* PI children who were younger than 11 years at assessment were rated similarly to non-PI comparison children, but 12- to 18-year-old PI children who were adopted after 18 months had more executive function difficulties compared to PI children adopted at younger ages and non-PI children. Again, the risk of longer-term executive function difficulties increased sharply after an age-at-adoption of 18 months.
* Direct assessments of working memory and inhibitory control were administered to 75 children, 8- to 17-year old PI Russian children adopted before 9 months or after 14 months . Older-adopted children displayed lower inhibitory control and poorer working memory than children adopted at younger ages, but the groups did not differ significantly on a spatial self-ordered search task, which measures spatial working memory. 

### Language Development

* Parents of 104, 15 - to 48 month-old PI Russian children reported on their children’s language development using the Child Development Inventory. Children adopted before 12 months of age displayed levels of expressive and receptive language skills at least through 4 years of age that were no different than those of USA non-PI comparison children. In contrast, language proficiency was lower for children adopted after 12 months of age in both the expressive and receptive domains. 
* Similarly, in another study, a sub-sample of 73, 8- to 17-year-old PI Russian children completed the Vocabulary subtest of the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-Fourth Edition. Children adopted after 14 months of age had lower vocabulary compared to children adopted before 9 months of age. 

### Academic Performance

* PI Russian children adopted after 14 months of age had higher rates of using learning support services compared to those adopted before 9 months of age.


## Moderators of the Effects of Early Institutionalization on Children’s Development

Moderating factors may explain differences in results across studies of PI children in the wider literature. PI children’s outcomes were found to vary based on:
- age at adoption
- severity of deprivation
- age at assessment
- gender


## Focus of the intervention:


The intervention focused on the improvement of the institutional environment by increasing the quality of caregiver–child interactions—without changes in nutrition, medical care, sanitation, and safety. Leading to substantial increases in the physical, cognitive, and social-emotional development of resident children with and without disabilities. 


## Research Team Intervention:

* Each institution was assigned to a different condition: Training plus Structural Changes** (T+SC), **training but no structural changes or Training Only **(TO), **no Intervention or care-as-usual** (NoI). **

                ■ **Training: **Training consisted of 12–14 sessions (approximately 60 h total) teaching caregivers to interact with children in a more “parent-like” manner by providing more warm, sensitive, and contingently responsive care to children.** **


                ■ **Structural changes: **Were designed to create a more “family-like” environment within the institution. These changes were designed to support caregiver–child interactions and relationships, and included reducing the number of caregivers per group, appointing primary caregivers who worked more consistently during the week, reducing group sizes, integrating groups by age and disability status, stopping periodic “graduations” of children to new rooms with new caregivers and peers, appointing a few consistent substitute caregivers for each group, and establishing “family hour” twice daily in which visitors were prohibited and children spent time with their caregivers.



## Key findings from Training and Structural Changes: 



* Children in the T+SC group showed the largest developmental gains, followed by those in the TO group, which in turn improved more than the NoI group. 
* Specific areas of improvement included physical growth, cognitive and social-emotional development, and attachment quality to caregivers. 
* Children improved more the longer they resided in the intervention institutions, and this was true for children with and without disabilities.
* Children exposed to 9+ months of the T+SC intervention improved from an average Battelle Developmental Quotient (DQ) of 57 to 92 
* Children with disabilities (T+SC) increased from a DQ of 23 to 42. 
* Children in the intervention institutions also gained more than those in NoI in height, weight, and chest circumference, and they progressively displayed fewer functional limitations; again gains were greater the longer children were in the intervention. 
* Transition to new groups of peers and caregivers disrupted emerging relationships. These developmental profiles showed that children who did not experience a transition (i.e., T+SC) made steady linear developmental improvement across age, but the scores of those children who did transition (i.e., TO) increased before and after but not during the age period when they were transitioned to a new group. Scores for children in NoI did not change before, during, or after a ward transition.

## 
    Scaled-Up Intervention:

* The intervention and its benefits for children were sustained on the institution’s regular government budget for at least 10 years after it was completed. 
* Similar interventions have been implemented in 15 institutions and more than 300 caregivers have been trained elsewhere in the Russian Federation with positive results.
