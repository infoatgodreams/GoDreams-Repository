# Brief:

* Scope & Description: The main argument of the article is that although social-emotional interventions in the child care institutions are required, maintaining those interventions is also crucial. This article reports the maintenance of one of the largest interventions conducted in St. Petersburg (Russian Federation) orphanages for children birth to 4 years using regular caregiving staff. The orphanages varied according to the interventions they received i.e. either training plus structural changes or training only.

# Sustainability of Socio-Emotional Intervention


## Meaning of Sustainability

* Sustainability refers to maintaining the effectiveness of interventions and transferring them to community agencies to be operated after the demonstration funding and researchers are no longer involved. The inability of researchers and practitioners to sustain successful interventions in the community has been lamented for decades.
* Of course, some interventions have been sustained (e.g., Eckenroade et al., 2010), but it is still often the case that intervention effects commonly fade after initial funding terminates, the intervention is transferred from researchers to practitioners, and attempts to implement the original program in new sites and new communities are made (e.g., Gomez et al., 2005; Hallfors, Cho, Livert, & Kadushin, 2002; Hallfors & Godette, 2002; Mancini & Marek, 2004)
* Across various disciplines, “sustainability” refers to a set of functions, typically conducted in sequence, including (a) demonstrating that the original intervention was effective, (b) maintaining the intervention effects in the original setting after initial research funding ends, (c) transferring responsibility for the intervention to practitioners and community agencies, (d) getting the same or similar evidenced-based interventions used in new communities by nonresearchers, and (e) demonstrating over long periods of time the effectiveness of such evidence-based interventions in communities.
* This article focuses on the second of the above sustainability components, which is called “maintenance” of effectiveness.
* Generally, such interventions produced developmental improvements or they prevented the developmental decline that was observed in untreated infants. These were “demonstrations” that benefits could be produced, there were no attempts to continue the intervention, and thus the developmental benefits diminished or disappeared (Bakermans-Kranenburg, van IJzendoorn, & Juffer, 2008; Rosas & McCall, in press).
* Even more comprehensive and longer term demonstration interventions may produce fading benefits if nothing is done to deliberately maintain them. For example, Sparling, Dragomir, Ramey, and Florescu (2005) provided young Romanian institutionalized children with newly hired and trained caregivers, one for each of four children, who conducted a variety of educational activities over a 12-month intervention period
* The children improved on the Denver Developmental Screening Test, but Carlson and Earls (1997) reported that the benefits to these children and to the institution faded in the years following the end of the intervention.
* Although most international child welfare professionals advocate for family alternatives to institutions, it is likely to take many years, if not decades, for most low-resource countries to place all children without permanent parents in families. Consequently, institutions potentially could be improved for the many children who are likely to reside there while alternatives are being developed (Groark & McCall, 2011; McCall, 2011).


## About the study 

* This study is a follow-up of the most comprehensive intervention reported in an institution for infants and young children using regular staff.It was conducted between 2000 and 2005, with follow-up assessments extending 6 years after the end of the original intervention project. Three institutions, called Baby Homes (BHs), in St. Petersburg (Russian Federation) were involved.
* In one BH, caregivers received training designed to promote more warm, sensitive, contingently responsive, and child-directed caregiver–child interactions, and a variety of structural changes were implemented to support the training and promote social-emotional relationships between caregivers and children in a more family-like context. A second BH received training but no structural changes, and a third continued with business as usual. The intervention produced the intended changes in caregiver behavior and the BH environment as measured by the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) Inventory, and children’s physical, cognitive, and social-emotional development improved substantially in the double-intervention BH (The St. Petersburg-USA Orphanage Research Team, 2008).
* It was hypothesized that these maintenance activities would preserve the intervention in two ways, first by maintaining the improved caregiver behavior and BH environment as reflected on the HOME Inventory, and second, as a result, maintaining the benefits to children’s behavioral development as measured by the Battelle Developmental Inventory.
* A follow-up project was funded approximately 2 years after the intervention project had terminated.
* Children departing the three BHs for these family destinations were given some of the same measurements as during the intervention. This study uses this reduced set of measurements on both the intervention and follow-up samples of children transitioning to the above destinations
* Children who remained in their randomly assigned conditions through 8 years of age have continued to demonstrate physical and cognitive benefits of foster care.
* Presumably, the quality of foster care remained high following placement, so the “treatment” condition persisted, but limited assessments of its continuing quality have been published. Some children were transferred to government organized foster care, which tended to be somewhat less effective (Fox et al., 2011)


# Method

## Participants

### Baby Home

* This study was conducted in three BHs caring for children birth to 4 years of age in St. Petersburg (Russian Federation) which had been involved in a major intervention project from 2000 to 2005.
* Briefly, caregivers in one BH received training in infant-toddler development and in warm, sensitive, contingently responsive, child-directed caregiverchild interactions. In addition, numerous structural and employment changes were made in this institution that promoted better caregiver–child inter-actions from fewer caregivers. This condition was called Training   Structural Changes (T   SC).
* Training + Structural Changes was implemented first, and it took approximately 1 year to complete the training and structural changes. Then training started in TO, and assessments were begun in NoI shortly thereafter.


### Maintenance activities.

* Attempts to maintain the intervention were of two types—creating an intervention that had features that would promote maintenance after the original demonstration project ended and procedures implemented during the intervention and the time following the intervention that might contribute to program maintenance.
* The original intervention involved several components thought to promote maintenance. First, the double intervention was implemented in a BH in which the director was thoroughly committed to implementing and maintaining the intervention and insisted that her staff do so.
* Second, although the intervention project provided substantial resources to this BH including some funds to hire additional caregivers, the intervention was designed to reduce the number of different caregivers in children’s lives but not to increase the number of caregiver hours available to children.
* Third, a train-the-trainer strategy was adopted so that training personnel were continually available to prepare new caregivers who replaced those who left during and after the intervention
* Fourth, an in-house monitoring and supervision system was established in which specialists (e.g., staff professionals in children with disabilities, early education) were responsible for monitoring the caregivers and encouraging them to implement the training on the wards on a continuing basis.
* Furthermore, following the end of the intervention project, additional coaching and technical assistance were provided by author Palmov and two other professionals to both Training + Structural Changes and TO, which consisted of weekly or bimonthly visitations, supervision, and periodic refresher training.


### Caregivers

* The primary and secondary caregivers in T+SC and the medical nurses and assistant teachers (i.e., main regular caregivers) up to approximately 50 in each BH were individually assessed periodically with the HOME Inventory (24-month group version; Bradley & Caldwell, 1995; Caldwell & Bradley, 1984)


### Departing children

* The sample for the current analyses was dictated by the sampling criteria for the follow-up project that focused on assessing the development of children who transitioned from these three BHs to families, either in the St. Petersburg region or to the United States.
* Only adopted children who spent at least 3 months in residence in one of the three BHs described above after the interventions had been completely implemented were included, a residency requirement deemed the minimum time necessary for the BH interventions to have an effect on children.
* Their average length of residency was 12.8 months (SD = 8.9). Therefore, this sample does not include children who “passed through” a BH in less than 3 months. Consequently, this sample included fewer children with disabilities or other developmental problems than the total BH population.
* Departing children fell into three time periods: Those who departed (a) during the intervention project, (b) during the first 2 years of the follow-up project (Follow-up Time 1), and (c) during the third and fourth years of the follow-up project (Follow-up Time 2). Ns varied with time period, BH, and assessment and are reported with the results


## Assessments [[Assessment Tools]]


### HOME Inventory

* The 24-month institutional version of the HOME Inventory (Bradley & Caldwell, 1995; Caldwell & Bradley, 1984) was selected because this age was approximately in the middle of the age range of children residing in these BHs.
* It consists of 5–11 items in each of six subscales (responsivity, acceptance, organization, learning materials, involvement, and variety) that are scored yes or no.
* In addition, a special sociability subscale was created by the authors consisting of the number of yes answers to all items on the HOME that pertained to the social behavior of caregivers and children.
* The HOME Inventory was conducted focusing on an individual caregiver attending to 5–14 children, typically with other caregivers present.


### Battelle Developmental Inventory.

* The Battelle Developmental Inventory (LINC Associates, 1988) was used to assess children’s general behavioral development. It was selected because the items were more relevant (“authentic”) to the BH context and it was better suited to children with mild disabilities than many other tests of general behavioral development.


## Procedure and Reliability

### HOME
* The HOME was administered in an entire BH before any training or structural changes were begun (i.e., preintervention), approximately a year after the interventions were completely implemented in a BH, and every year thereafter until the end of the intervention project (2005).
* A team of four assessors was trained by two experts in the HOME. After practicing, formal reliability was determined before the intervention project and approximately 2 years later. Correlations between assessors were .90  for the six subscales and .98 for the total score.


### Battelle Developmental Inventory

* Battelles were administered within the BH approximately 1 month before children’s departure (M = 4.6 weeks, SD = 7.1). During the intervention project, children were comprehensively assessed periodically, but only data from the Battelle personal-social and communication subscales from their departure assessment are reported here (i.e., Intervention). Four Battelle assessors were trained in the administration of the Battelle, and 2 years into the intervention project two additional assessors were trained. Formal reliabilities were obtained for all assessors.


# Effects of the intervention

## Estimates of Staff Turnover

* The first time period is approximately 2003–2005, which represents the last 18 months of the intervention project. The second time period is approximately 2005–2008 representing the 3 years between the final HOME assessment of the intervention project and the first assessment of the follow-up project. The third time period is approximately 2008–2011 representing the 3 years between the two assessments conducted during the follow-up project.
* First, the marginal annualized turnover rates for the two estimates were very similar within BHs and within time periods. Second, the weighted average annual turnover rates for T+SC and TO were very similar (14%–16%), but the rate for NoI was somewhat lower (7%–8%)
* Third, turnover rates averaged 13% per year and generally were not persistently different for the three BHs, minimizing the potential confounding role of turnover. However, rates were somewhat variable across time period and for BHs within time periods, especially 2005–2008 and 2008–2011. Intervention and administrative circumstances and changes in society may have contributed to this variability.
* The TO BH had higher turnover rates during the last two time periods, because they let go part-time staff in favor of keeping staff who would work more days per week. NoI was threatened by the local government with being closed entirely during the middle time period, but ultimately remained open with approximately half the number of children and caregivers.


## Maintenance of BH Differences in HOME Inventory Scores

* A major question was whether the differences between BHs in HOME Inventory scores produced by the intervention conditions would be maintained after the intervention project ended and through the follow-up project.
* Of primary interest in this study are the data from the four time periods following the intervention; the preintervention means indicate the status of the three BHs prior to the intervention to illustrate the amount of change subsequently produced by the intervention.
* During intervention Time 1 and Time 2, only the scores for T+SC were significantly higher than their preintervention scores. An analysis of variance of Intervention Condition (T+SC, TO, NoI) 9 Time (1–4) produced a significant difference among the three intervention conditions, F(2, 548) = 84.39, p &lt; .001, g2 = .24, and no BH 9 Time interaction, F &lt; 1. 
* This indicates that the interventions produced differences between the BHs, especially T+SC versus the other two BHs, and these differences between BHs remained over a period of at least 8 years, 6 years after the intervention project ended.
* This analysis also produced a significant time effect, F(3, 548) = 36.34, p &lt; .001, g2 = .17, consisting of an increase in total HOME scores between the end of the intervention (Time 2) and the beginning of the follow-up period (Time 3).
* Scheffe tests comparing each pair of time points indicated that Intervention Times 1 and 2 and Follow-up Times 3 and 4 were not significantly different (p > .62) but each of the two intervention times were significantly different from each of the two follow-up times (p &lt; .001).
* Results were similar when the Sociability score and the six conventional subscales of the HOME were analyzed. For the Sociability score, there was a BH effect, F(2, 548) = 69.44, p &lt; .001, g2 = .20, but no BH 9 Time interaction, F(6, 548) = 1.47. A time effect, F(3,548) = 36.99, p &lt; .001, g2 = .17, was accompanied by the same pairwise results as for total score (i.e., Intervention &lt; Follow-up).


### Overlapping longitudinal analyses


* The analyses of variance conducted within each of these three time periods were very uniform in their main results, specifically that there was an intervention condition effect in each time period accounting for partial g2 of .21–.37, and at the same time in each case the Intervention Condition 9 Time interaction had an F   1. A significant time effect occurred between the end of intervention and the beginning of follow-up (2005– 2008), consistent with the quasi-cross-sectional analysis reported above.
* Therefore, both quasi-cross-sectional and overlapping longitudinal analyses show that the intervention-produced differences in HOME scores among the three BHs were maintained throughout the intervention project as well as for 6 years afterward during the follow-up project.


### Old versus new caregivers.


* It was of some interest to note whether replacement caregivers (“new”), who received a mini training course, quickly adapted to the caregiving environment of their particular intervention condition relative to caregivers who had been in that BH for at least 2–3 years.
* The statistical analysis consisted of Intervention Condition 9 Old versus New Caregivers for the HOME assessment at a particular time point. Again, the results were quite uniform in showing that BH differences were highly significant at each of the three time points, and simple effects tests showed that in each case all three BHs were pairwise significantly different from one another.
* At one time point (2005–2008), there was a significant difference between old and new caregivers, but ironically this was a case in which new caregivers scored higher on the HOME than the older caregivers, but again without interaction with intervention condition.


## Children’s Battelle Subscale Departure Scores

* These data were analyzed with an Intervention Condition (T+SC, TO, NoI) 9 Time (Intervention, Follow-up Time 1, Follow-up Time 2) independent groups MANOVA. The main results of interest were a significant multivariate intervention condition effect, F(4, 694) = 7.58, p   .001, g2 = .04, and no interaction with time, F(8, 694) = 1.57, p = .13.
* The intervention condition effect was significant in univariate tests for personal-social, F(2, 348) = 5.50, p = .004, g2 = .03, and for communication, F(2, 348) = 15.45, p   .001, g2 = .08
* Scores tended to increase between the intervention and Follow-up Time 1. The multivariate interaction was not significant. While T   SC maintained much higher scores than NoI throughout the follow-up period, TO’s scores during the follow-up period were as high as those from T   SC.
* Consistent with the HOME results, there was also a time effect, F(4, 694) = 3.30, p = .011, g2 = .02, and this was significant in univariate tests for both personal-social, F(2, 348) = 5.74, p = .004, g2 = .03, and communication, F(2, 348) = 3.78, p = .024, g2 = .02


# Discussion


## Main Results

* This article demonstrates that a comprehensive intervention in a St. Petersburg BH was maintained and continued to be associated with better developmental scores for children through the intervention project period as well as for approximately 6 years after the intervention project ended compared to two comparison BHs.
* The interventions consisted of T+SC, which included training caregivers in warm, sensitive, contingently responsive, and child directed caregiver–child interactions plus a variety of structural changes that reduced group sizes, assigned primary and secondary caregivers, eliminated periodic graduations to wards, integrated groups by age and disability status, and promoted more consistent relationships with fewer caregivers. Another BH received TO without the structural changes, and a third had NoI
* The results were quite uniform for the HOME Inventory total scores, a sociability index made up of 21 items reflecting caregiver–child social interactions, and the HOME subscales. They demonstrated that the intervention produced an increase in scores in T+SC, but not TO and NoI, from preintervention levels to Intervention Times 1 and 2 (approximately the last 1–2 years of the intervention project).
* In addition, HOME scores remained steady over the two time points during the intervention and the two time points during follow-up, but they rose unexpectedly over the 3 years between the end of the intervention project and the beginning of the follow-up (Times 2 and 3, 2005–2008).
* The Battelle Developmental Inventory’s personalsocial and communication subscales essentially mirrored the trend in HOME scores. Specifically, the multivariate differences in children’s behavioral development scores produced by intervention conditions were maintained during the last years of the intervention project and for 6 years thereafter with no multivariate interaction with time.


## Maintenance of Intervention Effects

* Several factors might have contributed to the maintenance of intervention effects on caregivers, the environment, and children’s development.
* First, the nature of the intervention may be a factor. In contrast to interventions consisting of supplementary stimulation often provided by research assistants or special supplementary staff in which effects typically diminish after the intervention is terminated, the current intervention was aimed at changing the behavior of all regular staff members in an entire institution. 
* More speculatively, it is possible that the children themselves helped to maintain the caregiver– child interactions. During the intervention, children’s development in T+SC improved in noticeable ways; children were more active and responsive to caregivers, and they expected caregivers to talk and interact with them
* Thus, it is possible that the reciprocal nature of caregiver–child interactions helps to maintain those sensitive and responsive engagements.
* A second contributor was the deliberate attempts during the planning of the intervention to help it persist (Altman, 1995). A train-the-trainer strategy had been employed so that trainers would be available to train replacement (“new”) caregivers. 
* Such a strategy may have contributed to the finding that new caregivers scored the same on the HOME as old caregivers at each time point within each BH.
* Third, the importance of having a director committed to the intervention should not be minimized. In the authors’ experience in this and studies of interventions in other institutions, a committed director is imperative; without it, staff remain unmotivated to change.
* Fourth, certain activities during the follow-up period probably helped. For example, the monitoring and supervision system that was established in T+SC as part of the intervention and continued thereafter was designed to continuously encourage caregivers to implement on the wards the training they had received.


## Staff Turnover Rates

* Staff turnover has the potential to corrode the maintenance of the intervention. Turnover rates in these BHs averaged approximately 13% per year, which was relatively consistent across the three BHs and across time, with a few exceptions.
* A turnover rate of 13% per year could mean that one in four caregivers is replaced in 2 years and more than one in three in 3 years—a span of time that characterizes the residential term of some infants and young children.
* Indeed, turnover rate plus other factors contributing to many and changing caregivers meant that in these BHs during the intervention years (2003–2005), children experienced 60–100 different caregivers in TO and NoI by 19 months of age (the intervention in T+SC reduced this figure by approximately half; The St. Petersburg-USA Orphanage Research Team, 2008)
* The generalizability of these St. Petersburg (RF) staff-turnover rates to other institutions around the world is not certain.
* On the one hand, the three BHs were relatively consistent in their turnover rates across the 8-year period. Caregiving in St. Petersburg is a relatively low-status, low-paying job, although contributions are made by the government toward caregiver pensions. This may not be the case in every country.
* This speculation prompts a possible suggestion of increasing the salaries, pension contribution, or job security of caregivers as a policy change that might promote less staff turnover and more consistent caregivers in the lives of institutionalized children


## Societal Improvements

* An unexpected finding was that not only were caregiver behaviors and children’s development maintained after the intervention, but they actually improved.
* It is unlikely that the factors designed to maintain the intervention produced this subsequent increase in HOME and Battelle scores, because the improvement occurred in each BH and only between the end of the intervention and the beginning of the follow-up; maintenance factors existed within the intervention period and within the follow-up period, but no such improvement occurred during these intervals.
* We can only speculate about events that occurred in St. Petersburg predominantly between 2005 and 2008 that might have influenced caregiver behavior and the caregiving environment and presumably its effects on children’s development (Rosas et al., 2011).
* While the number of children being sent to BHs in St. Petersburg declined substantially (e.g., BH populations declined approximately 10%–15%), BH directors attempted to maintain their staffs. The net result was smaller groups of children cared for by nearly the same number of caregivers, which produced lower children–caregiver ratios.
* Thus, smaller children–caregiver ratios may be a major contributor to institutionalized children’s development, a proposition consistent with differences between institutions in this regard and children’s development (Groark et al., 2012) and the literature on nonresidential child care (e.g., Kontos & Fiene, 1987; NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 2000)
* Thus, the number of different caregivers experienced by a child likely did not change greatly during the intervention in T+SC, but this factor was not found to mediate intervention effects (Rosas et al., 2011); however, the number of children per caregiver did decrease.
* But dramatic improvement over time in HOME scales may be associated with the HOME scale itself and its application to group settings.
* Items on the HOME are scored yes or no as a function of whether the caregiver performed the indicated action at least once with at least one child during the 1-hr observation period.
* Intervention differences in children’s personalsocial and communication development were also maintained during and after the intervention, and these scores also tended to improve between the end of intervention and follow-up but not as dramatically as the HOME scale.
* Thus, we believe that reducing group size and the number of children per caregiver likely improved caregiver behavior with children and children’s development in otherwise deficient environments, but its effects were not as strong as those produced by a comprehensive intervention.
* The most unexpected finding was the substantial apparent improvement in Battelle scores for TO children between the intervention and followup periods to levels equal to or exceeding those for T+SC children (although the interaction was not statistically significant). One possible explanation is that TO was encouraged to implement the same structural changes as T+SC during this time period; although this was only partly accomplished, it may have produced some or all of this improvement
* A second explanation pertains to changes in placement practices, partly in response to the decline in the number of children being sent to BHs generally.
* The TO BH tried to keep the number of children in residence as high as possible so they could justify retaining staff.
* These children tended to be transferred to adoptive and foster families, but the total number of children transitioned nevertheless declined in part because some of the transitions occurred before the 3-month residency requirement of this study.


## Assets and Limitations

* The St. Petersburg study is the most comprehensive intervention in institutions for infants and toddlers using regular institutional staff caregivers (Bakermans-Kranenburg et al., 2008), and it is the most comprehensively evaluated institutional intervention.
* Furthermore, this is the only report of a successful attempt to maintain an intervention in an institution for infants and toddlers over the years of the intervention project itself as well as for 6 years after its termination
* A major limitation would appear to be the lack in this report of preintervention data to demonstrate that the differences between BHs that were maintained during and following the intervention were not associated with preexisting developmental differences in the children.
* A related concern is the possibility that BHs were assigned different types of children over the years and that children destined for different types of families were developmentally different.
* A recently completed study of the same children represented in this report shows that children who were transitioned to U.S. adoptive families and St. Petersburg adoptive, foster, and biological families from these three BHs were not different in birth weight, length, and head circumference; departure height, weight, and Battelle scores; and length of residence in the BH.
* Thus, although some shifting in allocations and departure destinations between BHs did occur during follow-up, the lack of overall developmental differences associated with these factors minimizes the likelihood that they played a major role in the maintenance effect.
* Another limitation is that this study used only those BH children who transitioned to U.S. families through one adoption agency and to Russian families. The children studied are indeed selected (by parents), but by far the largest group in the BHs who were not studied are also selected for adoption to the United States and Western Europe but through other agencies.
* Finally, the literature reviewed above emphasizes that intervention effects are more likely to be maintained if the intervention itself is created in a way to support maintenance and if various activities aimed at maintenance are conducted after the intervention project is terminated, and we believe the steps taken in these regards contributed to the maintenance we observed.
* Nevertheless, this study does not provide direct support for this speculation, because no control condition was conducted that omitted those activities. Furthermore, this study only reports the “maintenance” of an intervention after the intervention project terminated in the same institutions and with some of the original researchers still involved with these institutions.
