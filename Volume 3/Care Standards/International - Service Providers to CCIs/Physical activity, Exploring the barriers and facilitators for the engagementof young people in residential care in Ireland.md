# Brief:

* Scope & Description: The current research was designed to explore  Physical Activity (PA) engagement of Young people (YP) living in residential care settings in Ireland. Twenty-five staff working with YP within residential care were interviewed with the help of an interview guide designed to explore their perceptions of the barriers and facilitators for PA engagement for this group of young people. The results are discussed in the context of identifying strategies for the development of opportunities for PA en­gagement, in order to enhance positive outcomes for this population of vulnerable YP, within the residential care setting and the-beyond.

# Young People in Alternative Care:

* Young people living in care are among the most vulnerable groups in our society, in terms of their risk of a range of poor outcomes, including overall mental health, educational attainments and social wellbeing (Pinto & Woolgar, 2015; Bruce et al., 2019b).
* International research has indicated that YP are in alternative care for a wide variety of reasons, and a large proportion have suffered physical, sexual or emotional abuse (Gonzalez-Garcia et al., 2017; Pinto & Woolgar, 2015; Villodas, Litrownik, Newton, & Davis, 2016).
* Referrals to mental health services within this group of YP has been consistently found to range from between 40 and 88% (Burns et al., 2004; Blower et al., 2004; Ford et al., 2007; Golding, 2010; Gonzalez-Garcia et al., 2017; Jozefiak et al., 2016) compared to ten percent in the general public (Green, McGinnity, Meltzer, Ford & Goodman, 2004).
* Previous research has suggested that many YP in residential care settings often do not have access to extra-curricular learning and activity opportunities which could help deal with their physical, social and emotional needs (Vacca, 2008). 
* Research conducted directly with YP in care has indicated the significant value they place on relationships with care staff and peers, whilst highlighting the difficulty they can experience in developing these connections and relationships (Steckley, 2011; Berridge, 2017; Sandu, 2020; Virat & Dubreil, 2020). 
* Due to their lived experiences and the need for numerous changes in care and home en­vironments, school attendance can be problematic for this group of YP (Murray, 2012; Hollingworth, 2012; Quarmby, 2014; Brady & Gilligan, 2020). A consequence of this can often be that Young People in care miss out on school-based activities and therefore are more dependent on out-of-school activities. 
* There was a further belief that due to previous experiences and life events these YP may be more susceptible to influence by others, but not to be influenced by the adults around them as easily as their peers. Mary outlined how she believed that “kids in care are easily led by others also so get even more groupthink”.


# Potential of Physical Activity for Young People: 

* The WHO physical activity guidelines for young people aged 5–17 years state that they should accumulate at least 60 min of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity daily along with muscle-strengthening, flexibility and bone strengthening exercises three times each week. 
* Engagement in physical activity (PA) has consistently been found to be associated with positive outcomes for young people (YP), including improved physical, mental and emotional well- being (for a recent review see Zhang & Chen, 2019).
* There is significant evidence of the positive impact of participation in PA on psychological well being of YP (Bruce et al., 2019a; Conn et al., 2013; Eime et al., 2013; Conn, Calais, Szilagyi, Baldwin, & Jee, 2014), associated with reported happiness (Straatmann et al., 2016), self-esteem (Gomes et al., 2015; Quarmby, Sandford & Pickering, 2019), social relationships (Cox, et al., 2018). 
* Engagement in PA has also been reported to have negative associations with depression (Norris et al., 1992; Carter et al., 2016; Parker et al., 2016), negative affect (Straatmann et al., 2016) and emotional problems (Ussher et al., 2007) in YP.
* Previous research has highlighted the potential of engagement in activities for providing consistency and a sense of stability for YP who have experienced significant changes in their lives (Hollingworth, 2012) and this was also apparent in the current research findings, as staff recognised the stabilising impact of engagement in PA.


# Engagement in Physical Activity for Young People in care settings:
* Improves Social relationships:
    * Participation in structured activities, including PA, has been argued to be associated with better social relationships and mental health, but such engagement is lower for children in care than YP living in their homes (Conn, et al., 2013).
    * PA engagement has been found to facilitate the building of social networks and connections for this population of YP (Quarmby, 2014; Quarmby et al., 2019). 
* Build resilience
    * In order to improve long term outcomes, there is a need to build resilience with these vulnerable young people (Gilligan, 2000, 2008), and engagement in PA is argued to allow for the development of such resilient behaviours (White & Bennie, 2015).
    * Berridge (2017) study of 26 YP in care in England further identified the importance of stable and secure adult relationships within the care setting to help build resilience.
* Minimise disruptive effects of changes in care setting:
    * Fong, Schwab & Armour (2006) have proposed that in the face of placement changes, continuity of activities should be a priority for this group. They argue this would allow YP to maintain regular, familiar and/or normalising activities, which might minimise the disruptive effect of changes in care. In this respect, engagement in PA and sporting activities could be a stabilising factor during a period of change.
    * Gay et al. (2011) reported similar findings with significant correlations between PA and the opportunities and characteristics of the care settings. YP in settings with a recreation director and those in rural locations reported greater PA engagement, than those in urban locations. 
* Build confidence:
    * In more recent research, YP in residential care identified that engagement in sport and PA developed their confidence, competence, character and connections, with positive peer and adult relationships viewed as central to securing positive outcomes from such engagement (Quarmby et al., 2019).
* Better manage emotions and stressful life events:
    *  In terms of other outcomes, all of the participants discussed how engagement in PA provided a way for the YP to develop active strategies to deal with stressful life events. They talked about the potential of using PA as a way to vent and burn energy and for YP to manage their emotions
    * A number of the participants described how PA was identified within YP’s care plans as an intervention for reducing anxiety and how successful it could be. Maria discussed this in relation to the important emphasis placed on PA for an individual YP she worked with, stating that PA was “the last thing to be taken away from YP because it was an actual intervention that directly worked for her anxiety and anger and was part of her overall plan”.
* Develop their identity:
    * Participants frequently highlighted PA as an opportunity for YP to develop an identity based on a new hobby or activity and based on success and positive experiences in this activity.
    * Adolescence is recognised as significant time of identity development for YP in care (Gilligan, 2008) and PA was identified in the current research as offering the opportunity for the development of a positive sense of identity, similar to previous research (Lakey et al., 2017; White & Benny, 2015). The staff viewed engagement in PA as a way of helping YP to reshape their identity and build hope, providing opportunities for experiencing success, recognition and praise


# Barriers for Young People’s engagement in Physical Activity in care settings:

* Experience of Trauma:
    * Adversity in life and in particular the experience of trauma and disruption was identified as the most significant barriers for YP’s limited engagement in PA. 
    * The impact of previous chaotic lifestyles on current choices and behaviours, was highlighted as one of the main reasons PA was not viewed as a priority for these YP.
    * There were numerous reports of how these adverse events continued to impact the YP in the care setting, and to affect their ability to engage in activities or to develop necessary skills for engagement. Lauren talked about the priorities that these young people had in their early lives and the significant impact of this on them later in life “From infancy a lot of these YP have been anxious about being safe and this was much more important than the ability to have fun, and learn how to be with others” 
    * Due to adverse life experiences these YP can often have lower in­trapersonal skills than their peers (Fratto, 2016) along with reduced levels of self efficacy (Quarmby & Pickering, 2016a,b) which can directly impact their willingness and motivation to engage in PA
* Routine in care settings:
    * There was a belief that as YP had limited choices in their daily lives in the setting, this often led to a reluctance to engage when offered a choice to participate in an activity. This was further impacted by the fact that YP often did not recognise the benefits engagement may provide
    * There was a common sub-theme in discussions of the routine acting as a barrier for the YP engaging in spontaneous activities. This was recognised as a significant barrier for unprompted engagement in PA as Jane, for example, talked about how at times it can be like “groundhog Day, for the YP, every day is the same”.
    * Quarmby (2014) has similarly suggested that the organisational structure of the care settings and the policies that govern activities can impact the ability of YP to engage in PA. The authors argue that the need to plan all activities in advance may reduce the sense of control that YP develop in activities, thus acting as a barrier to engagement and their sense of enjoyment 
    * Consistent with other research in the area, the staff in the current study felt that YP whilst living in residential care may prioritise other areas of their life due to the serious nature of their life, which prevent them engaging in behaviours that may lead to long term positive outcomes, (Berridge, 2017).
* Being under the radar in care settings:
    * Several participants discussed how the YP in care settings feel that they are being constantly analysed by the professionals, which prevented the YP entering a further situation where they were being judged.
    * A significant sub theme in the interviews was the impact of the environment within the residential care setting on the YP, which often meant that typical activities YP engage in were not appealing to the YP. In particular, there was a recognition of the types of interactions within the settings, where YP were constantly accompanied by staff and the impact this had on engagement in PA
* Stigma related to their identity as a child in care:
    * The expectation that YP would engage with people outside of the care setting, or reveal their identity as a child in care, could lead to fear and act as a barrier to engagement in community based activities.
    * This fear of being judged was felt to extend to outside of the care setting for YP, and acted as a significant barrier to engagement in community activities. Participants identified that YP do not want to appear different to others, and often expressed fear of engaging in PA activities outside of the care setting for this reason.
    * There was a common sub-theme in the data of YP expressing a need to hide their identity from others, as they did not wish their living circumstances to be apparent 
    * The identity attached to being a child in care was believed to be a negative one for YP and linked to lack of acceptance by others. Paul outlined the reluctance YP often feel “different people going out with the young person all the time, and they think people will know I’m in care because they’ll know I’m different, I’m not with my family like others”. 
    * Greater restraint such as having friends over or being able to be on their own with friends after the events was argued to prevent YP engaging in PA outside of the residential unit. The participants suggested that YP were often fearful of the stigma of being a child in care leading to rejection and so they chose not to engage with others.
    * In addition, these YP can experience ongoing stigma related to their identity as a child in care, which can lead to fear and anxiety in social interactions (Gilligan, 2008).
* Low motivation and lack of hope in future:
    * Within this sub-theme a lack of hope was prominent as being observed in YP and a belief that this explained YP’s lack of engagement in PA. This lack of hope in the future was also linked directly to YP’s recognition of the importance of making positive changes in their lives to improve their overall wellbeing
    * The motivation to engage in activities was perceived to represent a significant obstacle to YP engaging, whilst previously it was suggested that physical access to PA may have prevented engagement.
* Technology:
    * Similarly, a number of the discussions identified the role of technology in YP’s lives leading to more sedentary behaviour and acting as a direct obstacle to engaging in PA.
    * There were some concerns during discussion of the use of technology that these YP, due to higher levels of anxiety, were more likely to be impacted by long term engagement with technology, and the potential for engagement in PA to overcome this.
* Low social skills:
    * The participants frequently identified this as one of the major obstacles for the YP’s engagement, as they lacked the necessary social skills to join activities with others.
    * They talked about how the YP were sometimes aware of their lack of social skills and this prevented them from engaging, despite a desire to become involved
    * The staff frequently identified the role of previous life experiences on the difficulty YP had in developing the necessary social skills, such as lack of engagement in PA and play as young children. This was illustrated by Stephen’s point that for these YP PA “wasn’t a priority for these kids, so they never learnt how so now don’t know how to start”. “Ability to play, the spontaneous ability, is often missing in YPs lives, they just didn’t learn this and had the opportunity when they were younger”. 


# Strategies to increase engagement in Physical activity for Young people in care settings:

* Recognising and understanding trauma:
    * In terms of strategies to increase engagement in PA, there was a common theme of the importance of recognising and understanding adversity and trauma and incorporating this into all work with YP.
    * Based on these unique and individual experiences of this group of YP Bruce et al. (2019a) argue that an understanding of trauma informed practice is imperative when working with these YP, and that PA can be important to help the YP to reach their full potential, in the face of these challenges
* Shared experiences:
    * Attachment to significant others within the residential setting and outside was a dominant theme that was identified as presenting an obstacle and a facilitating factor for engagement, in relation to family and peers.
    * Similar to this, the importance of shared experiences between YP and staff was identified as linked to both motivation, further relationship building and as an overall positive outcome from PA engagement.
    * PA was viewed as a way of the YP developing these connections, and offering a non-threatening or safe way of developing these.
    * PA and sharing the experience of the activity was further identified as a potential way of helping YP to reconnect and extend their relationships with families. This was also discussed as non-directive way of the family engaging with the YP and the staff within the care setting
    * Similar to this point, PA was highlighted as an opportunity for staff and YP to develop relationships in a non-directive way, and as a powerful strategy for ongoing work with YP, as trust developed within the relationship. This sharing of positive achievements through PA was frequently discussed as creating a significant impact on the YP but required a joint engagement and sharing of the experience of PA.
* Informal activities:
    * While there was a clear recognition of structured PA within the residential setting, the participants also talked about the importance of non-formal physical activities as a way of working with YP, and the perception of choice this afforded the YP. 
    * Brain suggested that the organic nature of informal activities could be very effective “sometimes if planned the YP won't do it but if natural can happen easier, simple as being outside kicking a ball and it can develop into a match. But if you organised a match they wouldn’t engage”.
    * Whilst structured PA was identified as important in the current study, the role of informal or unstructured activities was seen as providing control and sense of agency to the YP. Informal PA also overcame the issue of YP rebelling against structured activities and facilitated the development of skills for spontaneous play and games, which it was felt some YP had limited experience of engaging in. The findings in the current study also indicated that informal activities would allow for the development of skills that YP could use to further develop relationships with peers
