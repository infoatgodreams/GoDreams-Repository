# Brief:
* Scope & Description: In this paper a replication of the Helsingborg study (Tideman et al, 2011), was staged in the municipality of Norrköping 2008 to 2011. Results confirm the conclusions from the original study, that children in foster care can benefit from a working model aimed to improve school performance. Furthermore, a possible way to address poor numeracy skills by computerized working memory training was found

# Educational attainment in children in care:
* Children in long term foster care tend to have substantially lower school achievements and educational attainments than peers growing up in their own families, even after controlling for socioeconomic and other relevant confounders (eg. Vinnerljung, Öhman & Gunnarson, 2005; Vinnerljung, Berlin & Hjern, 2010). 
* Results from a host of national cohort studies have also shown that this group has radically higher risks (RR 6-10) for unfavourable outcomes in early adulthood, such as:
    * suicidal behaviour and other health problems, 
    * substance abuse, 
    * severe criminality, 
    * and welfare dependency 
* After adjustment for school failure (no or very poor grades from the end of primary school), the size of these excessive risks were in recent population studies reduced by 40-50 percent for care leavers from long term foster care (Berlin, Vinnerljung & Hjern, 2011), confirming the hypothesis of the distinguished UK scholar Sonia Jackson that poor educational performance is a determinant for young care leavers’ life prospects (Jackson, 1994).
* Factors promoting good school results for children care:
    * Teachers’ positive expectations:
        * As stated by authors as Mitchell (2006), and shown in meta analysis by Hattie (2009), teachers’ positive expectations of academic performance have a substantial impact on children’s school achievements. 
    * Feedback on students’ performance:
        * Another important factor promoting good school results is feedback on students’ performance. Hattie clarifies that effective feedback should cover three aspects: 
            * What direction am I heading? 
            * How am I doing? 
            * What is my next step forward? 
    * Formal assessment of performance:
        * A third strong factor in Hattie’s syntheses is formal assessment of performance (effect size 0.90). In the Skolfam model these three factors are applied
* Environmental Factors affecting school performance of children in care:
    * Environmental factors in the past or present that could influence the child's academic school performance. 
    * Factors we assumed could have influenced the school performance were for example:
        * severe neglect before placement
        * nutritional deprivation before placement. 
    * Other factors were more related to present conditions, such as:
        * the foster parent´s willingness and abilities to support the child’s academic activities.


# A case example: The replication of the program used in the Helsingborg study

* Here we report on results from a replication of the program used in the Helsingborg study. The approach is known in the Nordic counties as the Skolfam model (School-Family care). 
* The first Skolfam trial was staged 2005 to 2008 in Helsingborg, involving 25 foster children aged 7-11. Results showed improved cognitive performance, spelling, word comprehension, and reading speed in a two year follow-up. Strengthened relations between teacher and child, as well as improved pro-social behaviour were also noted
* Results indicate a significant growth in intellectual capacity, self-concept, literacy and numeracy skills. 
    * Intellectual capacity:
        * Intellectual capacity, assessed by WISC-IV, increased in all four indexes and in the Full Scale index. 
        * Verbal comprehension index increased by 6.5 percent (p &lt; 0.001). 
        * Perceptual Reasoning index increased by 5.1 percent (p = 0.02). 
        * Working memory index increased by 8.5 percent (p = 0.02). 
        * Processing speed index increased by 6.4 percent (p = 0.04). 
        * The increase in Full Scale IQ was 8.4 percent (p &lt; 0.001).
    * Working Memory Index:
        * Mean increase in working memory index in this subgroup was 13.0 points (  16.6 %, SD = 12.1) in the Wechsler scale. 
        * In comparison, the 10 children who did not receive such an intervention, increased in mean 1.5 points (  1.5 %, SD = 12.1) in the same scale. 
        * The increase in each subgroup respectively was not significant, but the difference between subgroups was significant (p &lt; 0.05). 
        * Correlation analysis suggested a tendency towards a spill-over effect of working memory training outside the primary cognitive domain (WISC-IV, working memory scale), to the mathematical diagnostic test. 
        * However, this tendency was not statistically significant, due to low statistical power
    * Self-concept:
        * Self-concept, as measured in the Beck Youth Inventories, increased by 18.2 percent (SD = 17.7; p = 0.02) 
        * No significant changes over time were found in the other subscales: anxiety, depression, anger or disruptive behaviour
    * Literacy and language skills:
        * In the domain of literacy and language skills, there were consistent tendencies toward positive results in DLS word comprehension, reading speed, content comprehension, and spelling
        * When we estimated crude effect sizes, all results on the literacy and language tests were on par with, or even better than the results from the Helsingborg study (Tideman et al, 2011). 
    * Numeracy skills:
        * Numeracy skills increased by 61.1 percent for the whole group (N = 20; SD = 2.2; p = 0.004). Mean score at the baseline assessment was 2.65 in the stanine (1-9) scale, revealing substantial knowledge gaps
        * Thirteen children showed improved numeracy skill
        * We would like to stress that there were probably at least two different factors contributing to the positive outcomes for enhanced numeracy skills. 
            * One was the computerized training of working memory for children. 
            * The other was an approach in numeracy assessment, where we started from a “zero skills level”, regardless of the child’s age or school grade. This enabled us to detect early knowledge gaps that could be properly addressed by the teacher.
* The perhaps most salient conclusion is that the results reinforce Forsman’s and Vinnerljung’s scoping review (2011): poor school performance in out-of-home care can be improved, if children are given reasonably adequate support.
* Tools used to make the psychological assessment for children in care:
    * Instruments used in the psychological assessment were:
        * WISC-IV for intellectual ability (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children – fourth edition; Wechsler, 2003), 
        * Beck Youth scales for emotional status (Beck, Beck & Jolly 2004), ABAS-II (Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-II) for adaptive behaviour, 
        * SDQ parent and SDQ teacher for general strengths and difficulties (Goodman, 1997; Smedje et al, 1999), 
        * Visual analogue scale (Badia et al, 1999) to assess pupil-teacher relation. 
        * DLS (Järpsten, 1999, 2002, 2004) (Järpsten and Taube, 1997) for assessing reading and writing skills, DLSM for reading comprehension,
        *  “Reading chains” for assessment of verbal and reading fluency (Jacobsson, 2001) 
        * The Olof Magne mathematical diagnostic tests to assess numeracy performance (Engström and Magne, 2006).
* Limitations of the trial:
    * Power related limitation 
        * A power related limitation concerns the pedagogical assessment of literacy. Because of age related sectioning of tests, longitudinal comparisons become difficult. 
        * A test measuring digit processing at age 8 cannot be compared to reading comprehension for the same child at age 10. 
        * This is why data from reading speed, letter-chains and sentence-chains comes from only 12 individuals
    * Lack of guidance by strict manual:
        * The actual interventions were not guided by a strict manual as in some evidence-based programs. 
        * This left room for local resources and references to influence what support the children got. 
        * One example is that the children in Helsingborg received more computerized literacy training than in Norrköping. 
    * Generalisation: 
        * Two important factors limit generalisations from our study. 
            * Firstly, it is a small study in local settings. 
            * Secondly, comparing pre and post interventions scores without a comparison group or – as in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) – a control group does not enable us to infer any firm causal conclusions.
    * Hawthorne effect: 
        * Henceforth, we also do not know if the positive results are effects of the individualized educational interventions or of the attention given to each child, the latter a form of Hawthorne effect (Rosenthal & Jacobson, 1992). 
        * But we have seen clearly, both in the Helsingborg and the Norrköping project, that the pre-intervention assessments usually resulted in more positive expectations on the child’s ability to succeed in school among foster parents, teachers and case workers. 
        * If this is a Hawthorne effect, so be it. There is strong qualitative evidence from both trials that this benefited many children
