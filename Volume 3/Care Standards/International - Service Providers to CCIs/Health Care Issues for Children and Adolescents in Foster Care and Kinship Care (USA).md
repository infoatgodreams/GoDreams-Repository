# Children in Foster Care:

## Socioeconomic conditions of children before entering foster care:

- The majority of children entering foster care have lived in deprived and chaotic environments for a significant period of time until removal for imminent safety concerns secondary to maltreatment.
- More than 70% of children in foster care have a documented history of child abuse and/or neglect, and more than 80% have been exposed to significan levels of violence, including domestic violence.
- Before entering foster care, many children have experienced multiple caregivers, limiting their ability to form a stable attachment to a nurturing caregiver.

## Issues in foster care:

### Medical:

- Overall, 30% to 80% of children come into foster care with at least 1 medical problem,and one-third have a chronic medical condition.
- Early childhood trauma/toxic stress, especially if frequent or unremitting and not tempered by responsive, nurturing care giving, adversely affects the neurobiology of the developing brain.
- Up to 80% of children and adolescents enter with a significant mental health need, and almost 40% have significant oral health issues.
- Approximately 60% of children younger than 5 years have developmental health issues.

### Educational:

- It is observed that more than 40% of school-aged children have educational difficulties.
- Children in foster care are more likely to change schools during the school year, be in special education, and have a history of grade retention.
- Adolescents in foster care have poor educational outcomes: high school dropout rates are nearly 3 times higher than those among other low-income children, and just over 50% graduate from high school, many with an equivalency diploma.

### Psychosocial:

- Essentially all children in foster care have psychosocial issues related to family dysfunction.
- National data suggest that young adults who were in foster care as adolescents experience high rates of mental health problems, unemployment, homelessness, low educational attainment, and posttraumatic stress disorder.
- Early childhood trauma has been correlated with poor emotional regulation, aggression, hyperactivity, impulsivity, attention and attachment problems, and the inability to associate thought and mood.
- Chaotic, unresponsive caregiving before foster care is associated with insecure attachment disorders that may present as indiscriminate friendliness, hypervigilance, or social withdrawal.

## Curative Care:

### Screening:

- Ideally, children receive a full mental health evaluation, including a trauma assessment, shortly after entering foster care. A mental health screening to assess for suicide risk and acute mental health needs is important at entry to care, but a full evaluation is probably best conducted after the child has had some time to adjust to his or her new living situation and visitation with family.
- The AAP recommends an initial health screening within 72 hours of placement. However, younger or preverbal children, any child who is a suspected victim of abuse, or any child with a chronic medical or developmental condition should be seen within 24 hours.
- Ideally, children should have at least 3 health encounters over the first 3 months of foster care, as they adjust to their new circumstances. This schedule allows the pediatrician to monitor the child&#39;s adjustment to placement, to identify emerging needs, and to support the caregiver in helping the child.
- It is important to assess the child&#39;s overall health status, with a focus on developmental, educational, and emotional needs as well as the abilities of the child&#39;s caregiving environment to meet those needs at each and every health visit.

### Permanency plan:

- In addition to the initial health screen, experts recommend a comprehensive evaluation of each child&#39;s medical, dental, mental health, developmental, and educational needs within 30 days, resulting in a health plan that is shared with caregivers and child welfare professionals and integrated into the child&#39;s permanency plan.
- Continued communication with the child&#39;s caseworker is essential to ensure implementation of the child&#39;s health plan and its integration into the child welfare permanency plan.
- In a system abundant with transitions and psychosocial stressors, it is recommended that children in foster care be seen monthly during the first 6 months of life, every 3 months from 6 to 24 months of age, and then at a minimum of every 6 months to monitor their health, emotional wellbeing, development, psychosocial stressors, continued adjustment to their foster family, and visitation with birth parents or other relatives.

### Information Accessibility & Sharing:

- Information sharing is crucial to health care coordination. Several states have developed electronic data-sharing systems to improve communication among the child welfare and health care systems.
- Some states have adopted an abbreviated paper or computerized medical record, often referred to as a &quot;health passport.&quot; For the child in foster care, the health passport should include the child&#39;s chronic health problems, allergies, medications, psychosocial and family histories, trauma history, and developmental and immunization information.
- Electronic health records, regional health information systems, and immunization registries offer new tools for improving communication.
- Ideally, there is a healthcare manager who can contact schools, child care providers, former health care providers, health departments, immunization programs, or early intervention and/or Head Start programs to obtain and share health information on immunizations, newborn health screening results, hospitalizations, surgeries, allergies, chronic illnesses, medications, vision or hearing loss, family history, and developmental or educational evaluations when a child enters foster care.

### Suggested treatment plans:

- Optimal care for mental health concerns in a traumatized population includes a thorough mental health evaluation, including trauma assessment and assessment for comorbidities.
- Treatment, if indicated after evaluation, should incorporate appropriate therapy, including trauma-informed care, with appropriate education and support of the child&#39;s caregivers and caseworker.
- Treatment should be diagnosis specific and, ideally, evidence-based. Psychotropic medications, if indicated, should be initiated at low doses and titrated slowly, with close monitoring for efficacy and adverse effects. Polypharmacy should be avoided if possible. No patient should receive therapy with more than 1 psychotropic medication from any given class.
- Parent–child interaction therapy, child–parent psychotherapy, trauma focused cognitive behavioral therapy, and the attachment, self-regulation, and competency model are some recommended evidence-based trauma therapies that are unfortunately still not widely available

## Service providers for Foster homes:

### Pediatricians

#### Role:

- Assessing each child's unique health needs at entry into foster care is critical, and pediatricians must be prepared to provide necessary care even when little or no specific information about the child's health history is available at the time of the visit.
- Pediatricians caring for children in foster care will often be asked to prescribe psychotropic medications for children with behavioral problems and/or they will encounter children on psychotropic medication.
- Pediatricians can be advocates for children in their care to ensure that each child's health needs are met, screen for signs of abuse and neglect at every health encounter, remain alert to the quality of the caregiver–child relationship, and share any concerns with the child's caseworker.
- Pediatricians can welcome foster and kinship caregivers, caseworkers, and birth parents, when appropriate, to health visits and educate them about the effects of childhood trauma and adversity on a child's emotional and developmental health.
- Focusing all caregivers on working together on behalf of the child is an important role for pediatricians.
- Pediatricians may also want to check immunization registries and regional health information organizations for information about individual children.
- An encounter that includes the birth parent(s) is an opportunity to obtain a more detailed health history.
- In addition, pediatricians can encourage foster care agencies to send the foster parent, or at least a knowledgeable case manager, to a youth's appointment to facilitate the collection of health information.
- Pediatricians have a role in educating foster caregivers, caseworkers, birth parents, and adoptive parents about a child's health issues, the treatment plan, and the importance of providing predictable nurturance, normalizing activities, and the maintenance of similar routines and expectations across environments.

#### Challenges:

- Incomplete or unavailable health information, including: information about immunizations; newborn health screening results; medications; allergies; chronic illnesses; hospitalizations; surgeries; vision or hearing loss; family history; dental history; psychosocial history, including childhood trauma history; and developmental or educational problems. The child is frequently accompanied by individuals (caseworkers, transporters, and new foster parents) who have little to no knowledge of the child&#39;s current medical or social situation.
- Difficulty identifying who has the authority to consent for health care on behalf of the child.
- Inadequate resources for evaluation and treatment. This limitation is a combination of workforce, systems, and funding issues. Medicaid (either fee-for-service or managed care) is the primary health care coverage for children in foster care but may impose limits on certain health services, especially subspecialty, dental, and mental health care.

#### Advocating for Policies:

- Pediatricians can play an important role in advocating for policies that would improve the delivery of effective and integrated health services within their communities and states for children in foster care
- Pediatricians choosing to do this work must understand regional and state laws and guidelines regarding health information, confidentiality, and consent for children in foster care.
- The following list contains some policy goals for discussion with policy makers:
  - Pediatricians and mental health professionals should be included in interdisciplinary team meetings with state and local child welfare in developing the health care coordination and oversight plans mandated by federal law and in promoting the connection of children in foster care to pediatric medical homes.
  - State and local child welfare systems should ideally appoint a medical director, preferably a pediatrician, responsible for the oversight and coordination of health care systems for children in foster care.
  - Pediatricians can advocate for enhanced education about childhood trauma, its impact on child development and behavior, and appropriate treatment, including evidence-based parenting education for foster parents and other caregivers, caseworkers and all professionals involved with children in foster care.
  - Pediatricians can advocate for realigning financial resources with evidence-based and promising treatments and interventions.
  - Pediatricians can help ensure that children who are moved by the state into a foster care program are tracked and immediately enrolled in and covered by Medicaid until age 21 years by using the Chafee option. Since 2014, youth aging out of foster care have the option to elect Medicaid coverage under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act until 26 years of age.
  - Dedicated planning and oversight can be implemented when managed care organizations contract for care delivery for children with special health care needs (including children with complex and/or rare diseases, children with behavioral/mental health conditions, and children in foster care.

### Child welfare professional/case workers

- The child welfare professional is ultimately responsible for obtaining and making the child's health information available.
- Child welfare professionals can assist with determining who has the authority to consent for health care services on behalf of a child and familiarize pediatricians with specific consent guidelines, including those regarding the prescription of psychotropic medications, when applicable.
- The child welfare caseworker is also responsible for ensuring that the pediatrician has all needed health information.
- Child welfare caseworkers are also ultimately responsible for ensuring that children in foster care receive all appropriate and recommended healthcare.
- Child welfare professionals should incorporate the results and recommendations of comprehensive assessments into the child's court approved social service case plan (often called the permanency plan) to ensure that the multiple health needs of children and adolescents in foster care are addressed.

### Foster parents:

- Foster parents remain the major therapeutic intervention of the foster care system. Stable placement with a warm, nurturing, empathic, attuned caregiver is ideal.
- The foster/kinship home environment, stability in a placement, kinship placement, an empathic relationship among foster caregivers and birth parents, and consistent quality visitation have been shown to improve (or are recommended by experts to improve) child outcomes.
- Evidence indicates that foster parents and caseworkers may not fully appreciate all of a child's health conditions and lack the expertise to access and negotiate a complex health care system on behalf of children with significant needs.

### Medical Home:

- For children entering foster care, enrollment in a medical home is imperative to ensure the receipt of high-quality, comprehensive, coordinated health care that is continuous over time, compassionate, culturally competent, family centered, and child focused.
- The medical home can create a foster care–friendly environment by obtaining a copy of signed consents from the foster care agency and maintaining them as a part of the child's health record, having contact information for the child's caseworker in the child's chart, and sending a summary of the health visit that includes immunizations and other recommendations to the child's caseworker after each health care encounter.
- A way to create a foster care–friendly office is to familiarize staff with the effects of childhood trauma so that all staff members provide trauma informed care and use trauma informed language.
- The pediatric medical home can schedule more frequent health visits for children and adolescents in foster care to monitor the child's ongoing health needs and treatment, given the complexity of their health issues

## Recommendations by AAP:

### For pediatricians:

- Advocate for children and adolescents in foster care to receive health care in a medical home.
- Become educated on the special health care needs of children and adolescents in foster care and assist other professionals in addressing these needs.
- Become educated on the unique microculture of foster care, particularly the effects of previous trauma/toxic stress, especially abuse and neglect, and the effects of ongoing uncertainty, transitions, and losses on children, teenagers, and families.
- Develop office systems for communicating with caseworkers, foster caregivers, and other professionals during or after each health encounter. Collaboration with the caseworker or the health care manager for the child is fundamental to ensuring that health needs are addressed.
- Become educated on state privacy, consent, and confidentiality laws affecting children and adolescents in foster care, including specific consent issues related to the administration of psychotropic medication.
- Incorporate the results of a child's comprehensive evaluation into a health care summary that is shared with the child welfare professional. Make a special effort to educate children and adolescents about their own health needs and care.
- Pediatricians should immunize children in foster care per AAP recommendations. In the absence of this signed consent, the pediatrician is advised to obtain permission for immunization administration through the child welfare agency administration according to its protocols.

### Measurement tools [[impact assessment]]

- All children and adolescents should have a comprehensive evaluation of their medical, mental health, developmental, educational, and oral health status within 30 days of placement.
  - Ideally, all children should receive developmental, educational, and/or mental health evaluations, but priority should be given to children with needs identified through screening when resources are limited.
  - The importance of good dental care should be communicated to foster parent(s) and older children and adolescents in foster care.
- All children and adolescents should have a follow-up health assessment (Table 5 in the accompanying technical report3) within 60 to 90 days of placement.
- Every health encounter, especially periodic preventive health visits, presents opportunities for pediatricians to screen for signs of abuse or neglect, including poor weight gain, lack of warmth between the child and foster parent, frequent missed or canceled appointments, and failure to comply with health recommendations.
  - Height and weight (and head circumference for children aged ,3 years) should be measured and plotted on the growth curve, and BMI should be calculated beginning at age 2 years.
  - All body surfaces should be examined for burns, bruises, scars, deformities, and limitation of joint movement.
  - A genital and anal examination should be performed by the most experienced provider available (ideally an expert in child sexual abuse), especially for preverbal children.
    - Clinical judgment should be used regarding the timing of the examination. Ideally, it would be done at the initial visit but in cases in which the child is distressed and/or there is little concern regarding sexual abuse, the examination can be delayed until the comprehensive visit.
    - If concerned about sexual abuse, testing for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections should be performed.
    - Physical signs of abuse or neglect should be documented in writing and with photography of affected areas.

## Important Acts and Guidelines related to children's health and safety:

- Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act of 2011: involves a report in November 2011 by the US Government Accountability Office calling for increased oversight of these medications by states and subsequent federal legislation mandating greater oversight by states
- The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010) supports the expansion of the medical home model to meet the health needs of all patients, particularly those with complex health problems.
- Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act (2008), requires that states, in consultation with pediatricians and other health experts, develop systems for health oversight and coordination for children in foster care. This act outlines the important pieces of coordinated care: periodic health assessments, shared health information, provision of care in the context of a medical home, and oversight of prescription medications (particularly psychotropic drugs).
- The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act (2011) built on the well-being provisions of the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act to support children's emotional and developmental health and to ensure the oversight of psychotropic medications.
- The Standards of Excellence for Health Care Services for Children in Out-of-Home Care (updated in 2007): In 1988, the Child Welfare League of America, in consultation with the AAP, published guidelines for developing and organizing medical and mental health services for children in foster care.
- Fostering Health: Health Care for Children and Adolescents in Foster Care (2005) by the AAP involves detailed practice parameters for primary health care, developmental and mental health assessments, child abuse and neglect screening, and health care management.
