* How to measure VC and Orphan’s Performances 
    * Vulnerable children (VC) and orphaned children fall in the category of the disadvantaged group
    * Access to food, shelter and education remains a key challenge for the VC. This is due to the fact that their vulnerability has greatly been aggravated by lack of supportive socioeconomic factors such as quality health, income, and demographic changes
    * A manager is the person who is vested with formal authority over an organization or one of the organization’s subunits. 
    * Orphans and vulnerable children programme performance has been measured through:
        * project cost
        * quality, customer
        * stakeholder’s satisfaction
        * timeliness and achieving of the project objective 
    * Lekunze, Antwi and Oladele established that the institutions that used a stakeholder participatory approach while involving the youth had greater chances of success than others that did not consider such an approach
    * The study found that the interests and roles of the key stakeholders were very critical to the operations, however, stakeholder management was found to be characterized by casual and ad-hoc actions and predominantly not institutionalized
    * Same research indicated that similar studies carried out in India showed that 56% of projects had failed
* ## Role of Stakeholders and Consultation in the Programme 
    * There are three main types of stakeholders: 
        * Primary stakeholders are the people or groups that stand to be directly affected, either positively or negatively, by an effort or the actions of an agency, institution, or organization. 
        * Secondary stakeholders are people or groups that are indirectly affected, either positively or negatively, by an effort or the actions of an agency, institution, or organization. 
        * Key stakeholders, who might belong to either or neither of the first two groups, are those who can have a positive or negative effect on an effort, or who are important within an organization, agency, or institution engaged in an effort.
    * It was found that stakeholder consultation is more influential in service-oriented projects such as information technology and marketing based projects
    * In addition, to stakeholder consultation at an earlier stage in the project implementation process; it remains of ultimate importance to determine whether the stakeholders for whom the project has been initiated will accept it
    * Stakeholder acceptance refers to the final stage in the implementation process, at which point the ultimate efficacy of the project is determined
    * As an implementation strategy, Rossman discusses the importance of user involvement in the early stages of system development as a way of improving the likelihood of later acceptance
    * Bean and Radnor examine the use of intermediaries to act as a liaison between the designer, or implementation team, and the project’s potential users as a method to aid in stakeholder acceptance
    * Naidoo found out that user involvement refers to the psychological state of the individual and is defined as the importance and personal relevance of a system to a user. It is also defined as the user’s participation in the implementation process
    * There are two areas for user involvement when the company decides to implement a system: 
        * user involvement in the stage of definition of the company’s system needs
        * user participation in the implementation of systems
* ## Gaps in Stakeholder Consultations 
    * activity to promote healthy child development and provide support to families with young children has not been linked with efforts to promote family economic security in low-income communities
    * At the same time, initiatives to promote community building and address economic issues in low-income communities have typically not explicitly addressed the developmental and family support needs of young children and families
    * According to Ndiritu socio-economic background influence school participation and children from poor families are more involved in labour as prescribed by the community they live in
* Monitoring and Evaluation of the Programme
    * Monitoring and evaluation is a process of self assessment, knowledge generation, and collective action in which stakeholders in a program or intervention collaboratively define the evaluation issues, collect and analyze data, and have action as a result of what they learn through this process 
    * An evaluation from start to finish can give stakeholders a sense of ownership over the results; provide timely, reliable, and valid information for management decision-making, increase cost-effectiveness of monitoring and evaluation information
* ## Using Theoretical Framework for Programme Analysis: 
    * Stakeholder Theory
        * The stakeholder analysis thus seems like an appropriate candidate remedy for the complexity related challenges of the balanced scorecard as a strategic management tool
        * According to emergence of CSR to Stakeholder theory, which suggests that an organization's survival and success are recognized by the achievement of its economic (profit maximization) and non-economic (corporate social performance) objectives in the interest of their stakeholders
        * The theory argues that a firm’s financial success is dependent on its ability to formulate and execute a corporate strategy, which manages its relationships with stakeholders effectively
        * Management of rural road maintenance projects considers each stakeholder group in any of the three different ways, namely:
            * Normative: The normative viewpoint proposes that the firm considers the interests of the entire stakeholder group equally and not only of the customers or stockholders
            * Instrumental: favours a firm’s focus on improving economic performance arguing that economic success is the key objective for companies. To achieve this it is suggested that firm must lay emphasis on only those CSR attributes that directly improve the economic performance
            * Descriptive 
        * Stakeholder theory specifies the extent to which a corporation treats its stakeholders appropriately, and thus is linked to corporate social responsibility
    * Theory of Change
        * by understanding, what the project is trying to achieve, how and why, project staff and evaluators will be able to monitor and measure the desired results and compare them against the original theory of change 
* ## Impact of Variants on the Programme
    * Socio-Cultural Norms
        * Patriarchal (conservative) gender ideology is dominant in rural community and is believed to be the root of the patriarchal social structure in the country which hinders women from participating in community development related activities 
        * aspects of social-cultural factors influence the performance of orphans and vulnerable children Programmes in Kenya through:
            * gender involvement where discrimination is practised discourages women from participating in decisions affecting their future and wellbeing
            * without the protection of parents, cruelty, transactional sex, cheap or forced child labour, early marriage, child rape and even coerced commercial sex are common
    * Community Participation in the Programmes
        * The study also found that the aspects of community participation promote greater economic and social equality
        * encourage better access to services for all
        * enhance greater involvement in decision making and promotes deeper involvement in the organizing process resulting from the empowerment of people
    * Donor Funding
        * allocation of required funds annually enhances the implementation of major phases of OVC Programmes
        * adequate resources ensure effective performance of orphans and vulnerable children Programmes
        * transport infrastructure helps in the transportation of support materials for OVC Programmes like foodstuffs hence ensuring smooth execution of the projects
    * Monitoring and Evaluation of the Programmes
        * stakeholders are able to improve on mitigation factors by engaging in development matters with the government, resource audit, identification of gaps 
        * Helps in suggesting the way forward 
        * during the monitoring, the team interviews users and staff as well for their view on system performance and a scorecard is produced for each facility
        * monitoring and evaluation was conducted occasionally and that monitoring and evaluation improve the inclusivity of beneficiaries in OVC projects and create a good environment for interaction between stakeholders and bring onboard resources available
* ## Future Recommendations to enhance the Programme
    * the community should be sensitized to be heavily involved in these projects; including them as the stakeholders of the projects as well as allowing them to contribute to the projects hence improving the performance of the projects
    * parents and the community should be sensitized to the effect of some cultural practices which affect the children
    * allocation of funds should be increased to improve the OVCs' health status and financial resources should be estimated realistically at the time of planning for the success of the OVC programme that human resources efficiency enables monitoring of OVC Programmes
    * the information gained from monitoring and evaluation should be used to inform the project manager on areas with problems for proper planning to be done
