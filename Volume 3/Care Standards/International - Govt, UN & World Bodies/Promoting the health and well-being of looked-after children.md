# Children entering institutional care:

- Most children become looked after as a result of abuse and neglect. Almost half of children in care have a diagnosable mental health disorder and two-thirds have special educational needs.
- Delays in identifying and meeting their emotional well-being and mental health needs can have far reaching effects on all aspects of their lives, including their chances of reaching their potential and leading happy and healthy lives as adults.
-
## Mental health services:

  - Child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) play a crucial role in assessing and meeting any needs identified as part of the SDQ screening process
  - CCGs, local authorities and NHS England should ensure that CAMHS and other services provide targeted and dedicated support to looked-after children according to need.
-
## Special education needs (SEN):

  - Two-thirds of looked-after children have special educational needs (SEN) Of those, a significant proportion will have a statement or a learning difficulties assessment
  - To support children and young people with SEN or disabilities, including those who are looked after or leaving care, local authorities and CCGs must commission services jointly. This SEN provision applies to children and young people from birth to age 25.

# Measures used to assess the well-being of looked-after children: [[impact assessment]]

## Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ):

  - The SDQ is a clinically validated brief behavioural screening questionnaire for use with 4-17 year olds or 2-4 year olds. It is internationally validated and simple to administer.
  - It exists in three versions: for parents or carers, teachers and children aged 4-17, and can be used to screen for any problems related to a child's emotional well-being.
  - The SDQ comprises a series of statements that require a jugement on how well it describes the child by ticking one or three or four boxes for each question.

## Comprehensive Health Assessment Tool (CHAT):

  - To support the assessment process, the National Child and Maternal Health Intelligence Network (which is part of Public Health England) has developed a standardised and validated Comprehensive Health Assessment Tool (CHAT) for young people in the youth justice system

## Health assessment (Statutory health assessment):

  - The initial health assessment should result in a health plan, which is available in time for the first statutory review by the Independent Reviewing Officer (IRO) of the child's care plan. That case review must happen within 20 working days from when the child started to be looked after.
  - The statutory health assessment should address the areas specified in section 1 of Schedule 1 of the care planning regulations. These areas are:
    - the child's state of health, including physical, emotional and mental health
    - the child's health history including, as far as practicable, his or her family's health history
    - the effect of the child's health history on his or her development
    - existing arrangements for the child's health and dental care appropriate to their needs, which must include
    - routine checks of the child's general state of health, including dental health
    - treatment and monitoring for identified health (including physical, emotional and mental health) or dental care needs
    - preventive measures such as vaccination and immunisation
    - screening for defects of vision or hearing
    - advice and guidance on promoting health and effective personal care
    - any planned changes to the arrangements
    - the role of the appropriate person, such as a foster carer, residential social worker, school nurse or teacher, and of any other person who cares for the child in promoting his or her health
  - Health assessments should be: child-centred and age-appropriate and carried out with sensitivity to the child's wishes and feelings and fears, so that the child feels comfortable.
  - Health assessments, including reviews, should also be carried out as far as possible at a time and venue convenient to the child, their carers and parents.
  - They should take account of any particular needs, including attention to issues of disability, race, culture and gender and if they are unaccompanied asylum seekers.
  - They should give the child clear expectations about any further consultations, support or treatment needed. Explanations should include the reasons for this and the choices available, and the appropriateness of plans kept under review as necessary.
  - They should pay particular attention to health conditions that may be more prevalent in looked after children (such as foetal alcohol syndrome or attachment difficulties) and which may otherwise have been misdiagnosed.
  - The health assessment should:
    - be integrated with any other assessments and plans such as the child's Core Assessment or an Education, Health and Care Plan where the child has special educational needs
    - involve birth families as far as possible, so that an accurate picture of the child's physical, emotional and mental health can be built up
    - involve a named health professional to coordinate the health assessment and the actions set out in the health plan developed from that assessment.
  - The content of the health assessment should be age-sensitive and developmentally appropriate:
    -
### For under-fives, the focus will be on:
- attachment behaviour and emotional health
- physical health
- growth
- diet and nutrition
- screening and immunisations
- dental health
- considering the impact on the child of parental substance misuse
- monitoring developmental milestones, in particular the development of speech and language, gross and fine motor function, vision and hearing, play and pre-literacy skills, social skills.

### Ages 5-10, For primary school age children, the focus will be on:

- physical health and management of specific health conditions eg asthma
- communication skills
- ability to make relationships and to relate to peers
- mental and emotional health, including depression and conduct disorders
- progress at school
- exercise and diet and understanding of a healthy lifestyle
- maintenance of personal hygiene
- awareness of basic safety issues, including road safety
- provision of a healthy balanced diet
- ability to recognise and cope with the physical and emotional changes associated with puberty
- access to accurate simple information about sexual activity
- considering the impact on the child of parental substance misuse
- screening and immunisation dental health
- attachment behaviour
- social and self-help skills
- assessment of the risks of child sexual exploitation, antisocial or youth offending behaviour, bullying, domestic abuse or sexually harmful behaviour.


### Adolescents and those leaving care (11-18) For secondary school age children, the focus will be on:

- ability to take appropriate responsibility for their own health, including the management of specific health conditions, e.g. asthma, diabetes
- communication and interpersonal skills
- educational and social progress
- lifestyle, including diet and physical activity
- ensuring that immunisations are up to date
- dental and skin health
- mental and emotional health, including depression and conduct disorders
- understanding of issues relating to healthy relationships, including sexuality and sexual activity, contraception, sexually transmitted infection and the particular risks of early sexual activity
- access to sources of information and advice about a range of health issues, including the risks of alcohol, tobacco and other substance use, and access to sources of advice on modifying health risk behaviours. Assessment should be made of whether referral to specialist treatment for substance misuse is appropriate
- assessment of the risks of child sexual exploitation, antisocial or youth offending behaviour, bullying, domestic abuse or sexually harmful behaviour.

# Organisations and individuals involved in supporting looked-after children:
## Clinical Commissioning groups (CCGs):

  - CCGs are the main commissioners of health services. CCGs should ensure:
    - they can access the expertise of a designated doctor and nurse for looked-after children. Where a designated professional is employed by a different NHS organisation, this will need to be set out in a local agreement.
    - When looked-after children move placement or move into another CCG area and are currently receiving, or on a waiting list for, health services, their treatment continues uninterrupted. Looked-after children should be seen without delay or wait no longer than a child in a local area with an equivalent need who requires an equivalent service. The length of a placement should not affect a child's access to services.
    - Arrangements are in place to ensure a smooth transition for looked-after children and care leavers moving from child to adult health services.
  - When a child is first placed, the local authority looking after them has a shared responsibility with the relevant CCG to ensure that a full health assessment takes place and that a health plan is drawn up and implemented.
  - Some placements need to be arranged urgently and prior notification will not always be possible. In these cases, in accordance with Regulation 13(3)(f) of the Care Planning, Placement and Case Review (England) Regulations 2010, the local authority is expected to notify the relevant responsible CCG within five working days or as soon as reasonably practicable
  - Out of authority placements of looked-after children are dealt with in a different way. Where a CCG or a local authority, or both where they are acting together, arrange accommodation for a looked-after child in the area of another CCG, the originating CCG remains the responsible CCG for the services that CCGs have responsibility for commissioning. That is the case even where the child changes his or her GP practice
  - Factors that should determine any decision about which CCG's commissioned service undertakes the health assessment are:
    - the distance at which the child is placed. If a child is placed far from home, the responsible CCG should consider if it is more practicable, and will lead to the child receiving a better healthcare experience, to commission health professionals in the area of the receiving CCG
    - the need to ensure they are satisfied with the quality of health assessment and follow-up to the actions that are identified
    - knowledge about the availability of local services that can meet the child's needs.

## National Health Service (NHS):

  - The NHS has a major role in ensuring the timely and effective delivery of health services to looked-after children. In fulfilling those responsibilities the NHS contributes to meeting the health needs of looked-after children in three ways: commissioning effective services, delivering through provider organisations, and through individual practitioners providing coordinated care for each child.
  - Under the Children Act 1989, CCGs and NHS England have a duty to comply with requests from a local authority to help them provide support and services to looked-after children.
  - NHS England should ensure:
    - looked-after children are always registered with GPs and have access to dentists near to where they are living. This is a shared responsibility with the local authority for the children it looks after.
    - When looked-after children need to register with a new GP (e.g. when they enter care or change placement), the transfer of GP-held clinical records is fast tracked
  - NHS England guidance &quot;Who Pays? Determining responsibility for payments to providers; provides the framework for establishing responsibility for commissioning an individual's care within the NHS.
  - The Department of Health, with NHS England, Monitor, the Royal Colleges and other partners, has developed a mandatory national currency and tariff for statutory health assessments for looked-after children placed out of the area. Details are set out in the current National Tariff Payment System.

## Designated doctor and nurse:

  - Designated doctors and nurses have a very important role in promoting the health and welfare of looked-after children. The role is:
    - to assist CCGs and other commissioners of health services in fulfilling their responsibilities to improve the health of looked-after children
    - intended to be strategic, separate from any responsibilities for individual lookedafter children (although the professionals in these posts may also provide a direct service to children outside their designated role).
-
## Social workers:

  - **Care planning framework** : As an integral part of care planning, social workers must make arrangements to ensure that every looked-after child has:
    - their physical, emotional and mental health needs assessed
    - a health plan describing how those identified needs will be addressed to improve health outcomes
    - their health plan reviewed in line with care planning requirements, or at other times if the child's health needs change. This must be done in accordance with The Care Planning, Placement and Case Review (England) Regulations 2010.
  - Social workers have an important role in promoting the health and welfare of looked-after children. In particular they should:
    - work in partnership with carers, looked-after children, their birth parents where appropriate and health professionals to contribute to the formulation of the health plan
    - ensure that all the necessary consents and delegated authority permissions have been obtained so that decisions are not delayed
    - take action to liaise with relevant health professionals if actions identified in the health plan are not being followed up. Given the impact that poor physical, emotional and mental health can have on learning, they should also ensure the child's virtual school head is involved in resolving any health care needs that impact on the child's education
    - ensure the child has a copy of the care plan and the health plan
    - support foster carers, or the appropriate person in the children's home where a child is placed, to promote the child's physical and emotional health on a day-to-day basis. That should include providing them with information on the child's state of health, including a copy of the child's latest health plan
    - ensure that there is clarity for carers, GPs and dentists, and for the child, about what health care decisions have been delegated to carers.
  - Social workers should also ensure:
    - that foster carers and residential care staff know it is their responsibility to make sure a child attends their health assessment and all other medical, dental and optical appointments, and facilitate any required treatment regimes.
    - that the children their authority looks after, including teenage parents, have access to available positive activities such as arts, sport and culture, in order to promote their sense of well-being.

## Local authority:

  - As corporate parents, those involved in providing local authority services for the children they look after should have the same high aspirations and ensure the children receive the care and support they need in order to thrive.
  - Local authorities have a duty under the Children Act 1989 to safeguard and promote the welfare of the children they look after, wherever they are placed. This must be done in accordance with the relevant Regulations. These Regulations set out the requirements governing the development and review of a looked after child's care plan. That plan includes their health plan, the development of which should be based on the written report of the health assessment. The health plan forms part of the child's overall care plan.
  - The local authority that looks after the child must arrange for them to have a health assessment as required by The Care Planning, Placement and Case Review (England) Regulations 2010. The initial health assessment must be done by a registered medical practitioner. Review health assessments may be carried out by a registered nurse or registered midwife.
  - Understanding the emotional and behavioural needs of looked-after children is important. Local authorities are required to use the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to assess the emotional well-being of individual looked-after children
  - **Notification of placement:** When a child starts to be looked after or changes placement, the local authority must, before the placement is made, notify:
    - the child's GP,
    - parents (except where clearly inappropriate),
    - those caring for the child,
    - the CCG for the area in which the child is living,
    - the CCG and the local authority for the area in which the child is to be/ has been placed.
  - The local authority that looks after the child must make arrangements for a registered medical practitioner or a registered nurse or registered midwife to review a looked-after child's health needs and provide a written report for each review addressing the matters specified in section 1 of Schedule 1 of the Care Planning, Placement and Case Review (England) Regulations 2010 (see pages 16-17 of this guidance).
-
## Independent Reviewing Officers (IROs):

  - The IRO should, as part of the child's case review, note any actions and updates to ensure that the health plan continues to meet the child's needs.
  - The IRO should be proactive in bringing any deficiencies in the quality of the health plan or its delivery to the attention of the appropriate level of management within the local authority, using the local dispute resolution process if necessary
  - IROs should always ensure that looked-after children are involved in the review of their care plan and its component parts, and have their wishes and feelings heard and respected.
-
## Primary care teams (General Practitioners, health professionals, named professionals):

  - Staff working with looked-after children who are delivering health services should make sure their systems and processes track and focus on meeting each child's physical, emotional and mental health needs without making them feel different. They should in particular:
    - ensure looked-after children are able to access universal services as well as targeted and specialist services where necessary
    - receive supervision, training, guidance and support
  - The lead health record for a looked-after child should be the GP-held record. The initial health assessment and health plan, and subsequent review assessments and plans, should be part of that record.
  - Primary care teams have a vital role in identifying the individual health care needs of looked-after children. They often have prior knowledge of the child, of the birth parents and of carers, helping them to take a child-centred approach to health care decisions. They may also have continuing responsibility for the child when he or she returns home
  - GP practices should:
    - ensure timely access to a GP or other appropriate health professional when a looked-after child requires a consultation
    - provide summaries of the health history of a child who is looked after, including information on immunisations and covering their family history where relevant and appropriate, and ensure that this information is passed promptly to health professionals undertaking health assessments
    - maintain a record of the health assessment and contribute to any necessary action within the health plan
    - make sure the GP-held clinical record for a looked-after child is maintained and updated and that health records are transferred quickly if the child registers with a new GP practice, such as when he or she moves into another CCG area, leaves care or is adopted.
  - All healthcare staff who come into contact with looked-after children should work within the Royal Colleges intercollegiate framework. This framework identifies the competences that enable healthcare staff to promote the health and well-being of looked after children. They are a combination of the skills, knowledge, values and attitudes that are required for safe and effective practice
  - Named nurses and doctors for looked-after children have an important role in promoting good professional practice within their organisation and providing advice and expertise for fellow professionals
  - Working with the designated professionals for looked-after children, named health professionals should:
    - coordinate the provision of local health services for individual looked-after children and the input into health assessments and their reviews for individual looked-after children
    - ensure the timeliness and quality of health assessments for looked-after children and ensure actions taken to implement the health care plan are tracked
    - act as a key conduit and contact point for the child and their carer, where they have difficulties accessing health services.
-
## Virtual school heads (VSHs) and designated teachers:

  - Maintained schools and academies are required to have a designated teacher for looked after children. Given the interrelationship between health and education outcomes, social workers should ensure that the authority's VSH and the designated teacher for looked-after children are aware of information about the child's physical, emotional or mental health that may have an impact on his or her learning and educational progress

# Common guidelines for those working with looked after children:

- Local authorities, CCGs and NHS England can only carry out their responsibilities to promote the health and welfare of looked-after children if they cooperate. They are required to do so under section 10 of the Children Act 2004.
- The Health and Social Care Act 2012 places a legal duty on CCGs to work with local authorities to promote the integration of health and social care services.
- Local authorities, CCGs and NHS England need to reflect the high level of mental health needs amongst looked-after children in their strategic planning of child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). They should also plan for effective transition and consider the needs of care leavers.
- Effective channels of communication between all local authority staff working with looked-after children, CCGs, NHS England and health service providers, as well as carers – along with clear lines of accountability – are needed to ensure that the health needs of looked-after children are met without delay. Looked-after children themselves (according to age and understanding) should also have the information they need to make informed decisions about their health needs.
- The starting point for planning health services for looked-after children should be the statutory Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (JSNA) and the Joint Health and Wellbeing Strategy (JHWS). The statutory guidance on JSNAs and JHWSs states that health and wellbeing boards will need to consider the needs of vulnerable groups such as looked-after children and adopted children. The information gathered as part of that process should be used to identify gaps in provision to meet the physical and mental health needs of looked-after children and inform strategic commissioning priorities.
- CCGs and NHS England should ensure that a child is never refused a service, including for mental health, on the grounds of their placement being short-term or unplanned.
- Local authorities, CCGs and NHS England as well as providers of services should ensure that there are effective arrangements in place to share information about a child's health.
- The review of the child's health plan must happen at least once every six months before a child's fifth birthday and at least once every 12 months after the child's fifth birthday. The child's social worker and IRO have a role to play in monitoring the implementation of the health plan, as part of the child's wider care plan.
- Local authorities and health professionals should ensure that:
  - they follow the requirements set out in the Special educational needs and disability code of practice: 0 to 25 years
  - the looked-after child's EHC plan works in harmony with their care plan to tell a coherent and comprehensive story about how the child's health needs in relation to accessing education are being met

# Preparations for looked-after children transitioning out-of-care:

## Placement out of authority:

  - Social workers must notify the relevant CCG, in accordance with Regulations, when a child is placed out of authority. They should ensure that arrangements are made to secure health provision for the child.
  - In making a judgement about the suitability of an out of authority placement for a child, the responsible authority should assess, with input from health services, the arrangements which it will need to put in place to enable the child to access services such as primary and secondary health care.
  - When a looked-after child or child leaving care is moved out of a CCG area, arrangements should be made through discussion between the originating CCG and those currently providing healthcare and new providers to ensure continuity of healthcare

## Foster care and children's homes:

  - Fostering service and children homes providers should work respectively with foster carers and residential care staff to promote a child's health and well-being. Carers should be given information about the child's health needs as they have day-to-day responsibility for making sure those needs are met.
  - The local authority, as a corporate parent, the child's social worker and health professionals should work with children's home staff to secure and facilitate access to the health services that each child needs.
  - In particular, social workers and other relevant officers in the authority responsible for a looked-after child should ensure the necessary health outcomes are clear in the child's relevant plan and then work with the home to:
    - agree the specific responsibilities of the home towards supporting the health needs of each child at the time the placement is made
    - ensure that these responsibilities are recorded in the child's placement plan. This must include recording permission from a person with parental responsibility for the child for staff to administer first aid and non-prescription medication, and clearly agreed responsibilities for the administration of prescription medication
    - be confident that staff in the home have sufficient understanding of relevant local health provision, including the functions of the designated doctor and nurse for looked-after children in their area, and can support children to navigate these services, advocating on their behalf where necessary and appropriate.
-
## Children detained under the mental health act or in custody:

  - The legal status of children who are the subject of a care order is not affected by detention under the Mental Health Act or in custody. The responsibility of the local authority to promote the welfare of looked-after children who are so detained remains. That includes its responsibilities to maintain and review the child's health plan as part of his or her care plan.

# Transitions from care:

- Some children who cease to be looked after – whether returning home, adopted or with a Special Guardianship Order or making the transition to adulthood – will have continuing health needs that require ongoing treatment. Health professionals and social workers should ensure that there are suitable transition arrangements in place so that the child's health needs continue to be met. 
- In particular, they should ensure that prospective adopters and care leavers have, or know how to obtain, the information they require about what health services, advice and support are available locally to meet their needs.


## Children placed for adoption:

  - Children placed for adoption remain looked after until the adoption order is made. Research shows that their needs do not change overnight once they are adopted.
  - Local authorities should ensure there is consistent and sustained health care in place to support each child during the transition from care to a permanent home. This will help inform post-adoption support for the child and the child's new parents and enable continuity of services.

## Care leavers: [[Aftercare]]

  - Local authorities, CCGs and NHS England should ensure that there are effective plans in place to enable looked-after children aged 16 or 17 to make a smooth transition to adulthood, and that they are able to continue to obtain the health advice and services they need. In particular:
    - there should be an emphasis on partnership working between the young person and their personal adviser, and the doctors and nurses involved in their health assessments
    - personal advisers should have access to information and training about how to promote physical and mental health
    - transitions should be planned as early as possible, and certainly at least six months in advance of a transition to adult services, so that social workers, personal advisers, commissioners and providers of children's and adult services can manage transitions smoothly and ensure that young people are clear about expectations.
  - Information needs to be given to care leavers sensitively and with support, with an opportunity to discuss it with health professionals. Young people leaving care should be able to continue to obtain health advice and services, and know how to do so.
  - Care leavers with complex needs, including those with disabilities, may transfer directly to adult services and the pathway plan will need to ensure that this transition is seamless and supported.

# Confidentiality & Informed Consent:

- Accurate information about health history, and any current/ongoing medical conditions, may be vital to securing the right placement for a looked-after child.
- For this reason, obtaining consent to information sharing is a vital first principle to promoting the health of looked-after children. The person or third party will need to understand the reasons why particular information needs to be shared, so that they can give informed consent
- Where disclosure of a child's information might reveal information about other individuals (e.g. parents, family), consent should be sought from these individuals as well.
- Where it is not practicable to seek consent or where the individual is not competent to give consent, it is important to consider whether disclosure would be justified in the public interest(e.g. to protect others from a risk so serious that it outweighs the individual's right to privacy).
- Decisions to disclose information in the public interest must be taken on a case by case basis, and should always be fully documented
