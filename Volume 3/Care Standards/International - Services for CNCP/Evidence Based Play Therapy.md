# Summary: 

* Introduction
    * Mental illness is now the leading cause of disability for all persons 5 years of age and old
    * The president’s New Freedom Commission on Mental Health (2003) recommended the promotion of screening, assessing, and providing services for the mental health of young children, in addition to the improving and expanding of school mental health
    * Founded in 1982, the Association for Play Therapy (APT) formed to develop and promote play therapy as a separate and distinct psychotherapy modality for treatment. 
* META-ANALYTIC SUPPORT FOR PLAY THERAPY
* Chambless and Hollon (1998) suggest that treatment groups would need 50 clients per condition in order to reach sufficient statistical power in testing equivalency of groups
* Meta Analytic methodology combines the results from individual studies to produce an overall effect size, thereby determining the efficacy of the model intervention
* Filial Play Therapy in studies
* Filial therapy is a parental intervention based on child-centered play therapy from which parents are taught basic childcentered therapy skills to facilitate weekly play sessions with their children.
* When play therapy was delivered by a parent (ES = 1.15), the effect size was much larger than when delivered by a mental health professional (ES = .72), indicating the importance of involving parents in treatment to increase success of outcome
* finding was similar to the conclusions of LeBlanc and Ritchie (2001), who reported parent involvement as a predictor of play therapy outcome. Treatment duration was also a factor in the success of play therap
* Age and sex were not found to be significant factors from which to predict the effects of play therapy. Play therapy appeared to be equally effective across age and sex.
* play therapy had a moderate to large beneficial effect for internalizing, externalizing, and combined problem types.
* INDIVIDUAL STUDY SUPPORT FOR PLAY THERAPY
* These most recent studies have demonstrated the positive impact of play therapy on general behavioral problems
* Following sections are a review of the play therapy research conducted over the last 15 years
* Play Therapy with Children Identified as Lacking in Coping Mechanism
* In a pretest–posttest design, all students were measured on three scales, including a classroom observation, Self-Efficacy Scale for Children (S-ES) and the Conners Teacher Rating Scale (CTR
* Although both groups were found to increase favorable classroom behaviors through the CTRS and observation following treatment, they found that self-efficacy was significantly increased for those children participating in play therapy as measured by the S-ES.

* _PLAY THERAPY WITH HISPANIC CHILDREN_
* Hispanic children between the ages of 5 and 11 years old who were identified by teachers from three schools as experiencing behavioral problems
* Results demonstrated that children receiving play therapy showed statistically significant decreases in externalizing behavior problems, specifically conduct problems, and moderate improvements in internalizing behavior problems, specifically anxiety
* Effect sizes for several of the dependent measure scores indicated a moderate to large effect of play therapy, showing clinical significance in addition to statistical significance. Teacher BASC results demonstrated no statistical significance between the two groups
* _PLAY THERAPY WITH CHILDREN DIAGNOSED WITH INSULING DEPENDENT DIABETES_
* Researchers recruited study participants from a summer camp for children with diabetes. Thirty children were selected for the study based on age (between 7 and 11 years) and other protocol criteria. There were 17 boys and 13 girls in the study
* The children were randomly assigned to the experimental or control group on the first day of camp
* Children in the experimental group participated in 12 sessions of CCPT over the course of the 3-week camp. The control group received no additional intervention other than the summer camp
* According to data analysis, both groups improved anxiety scores with no statistically significant difference in scores between groups. The experimental group showed greater improvement on the FPC than the control group but did not reach statistical significance. The experimental group showed a statistically significant increase in diabetes adaptation as indicated on the DAS


* _PLAY THERAPY WITH CHILD WITNESSES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE_
* During a 6month period, CCPT was facilitated with all children between the ages of 4 and 10 years residing in the domestic shelter and whose parents agreed to be part of the study
* Complete data was collected on 22 children in the experimental group. Following the collection of data on the experimental group, data was collected on 11 children who met the same conditions of the experimental group but entered the shelter following the end of residence of experimental group member 
* Experimental group received 12 45-minute sessions of individual CCPT in a period of 12 days to 3 weeks. Play therapists completed an advanced course in play therapy
* control group participated in regular shelter programs for the same length of time as the experimental group but received no play therapy
* Following a treatment of play therapy, children in the experimental group scored significantly higher than children in the control group on self-concept as measured by the JSCS.
* Primary self concept scale
    * Mothers of the children in the experimental group reported that their children exhibited significantly fewer externalizing behavior problems as measured by the CBCL and fewer total behavior problems than the mothers of children in the control group.
    * Children in the experimental group scored significantly higher than children in the control group in physical proximity and play themes as measured by the CPSBRS.

* _PLAY THERAPY WITH LEARNING-DISABLED PREADOLESCENTS_
* Recruited fourthand fifth-grade volunteer students attending a private school specializing in the education of children with learning differences.  
* Thirty participants between the ages of 10 and 12 were randomly assigned to the treatment group (N= 15) or control group (N= 15)
* The treatment group was further divided into groups of three and participated in a group play therapy intervention 1 hour per week for 12 weeks. The intervention was based on humanistic play therapy guidelines
* The control group received no intervention
* pretest–posttest design was used with the Behavior Assessment System for Children—Parent Rating Form (BASC-PRF) and the Child Behavior Checklist—Parent Report Form (CBCL-PRF) serving as dependent variable
* Children who participated in the play therapy intervention demonstrated statistically significant improvement in scores on the BASC-PRF on overall composite scores and internalizing problems over children in the control group.

* _PLAY THERAPY WITH AT RISK STUDENTS_
* This study by Post (1999) examined the effects of a play therapy program on children identified as at risk specifically through poverty designation, achieving below grade level, special education identification, and mobility in home environment. 
* Seventy-seven students were assigned to the experimental group, and 91 were assigned to the control group. Further
* Children in the experimental group participated in CCPT, which was facilitated by graduate students trained in an introductory play therapy course
* Children in the experimental group received from 1 to 24 play therapy sessions once per week with a mean number of 4 sessions
* The control group received no intervention
* Although there was no difference between groups on anxiety, a statistically significant difference was found between groups on self-esteem and locus of control. Further analysis revealed that children participating in play therapy did not increase self-esteem and locus of control over time but maintained the pretest level.
* children in the control group not receiving play therapy suffered from a statistically significant loss in self-esteem and locus of control
* play therapy might be needed to prevent at-risk children from developing lower self-esteem and from reducing their sense of responsibility for their academic progress_

* _SHORT TERM PLAY THERAPY WITH CHINESE EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS_
* study by Shen (2002) investigated the impact of play therapy in an elementary school with Chinese children in Taiwan following an earthquake registering 7.3 on the Richter scale and resulting in the loss of many lives
* students were identified as being at high risk for maladjustment using the Children’s Mental Health Checklist (CMHC). The students, ranging from ages 8 to 12, were randomly and equally assigned to an experimental group and a control group.
* Each experimental small group received 10 40-minute group play therapy sessions during a 4-week span, meeting two to three times per week
* Group play therapy was facilitated by a school counselor trained in CCPT. The control group received no intervention
* Results of the RCMAS demonstrated a significant decrease in anxiety, as well as a large treatment effect, for children participating in the experimental group as compared to the control group. Suicide risk as measured by the MDI-C was also found to be significantly less in the experimental group as compared to the control group.

* HISTORICAL PLAY THERAPY STUDIES
* In the seven exemplary studies detailed in the previous description, historical flaws have been corrected and addressed. Contemporary play therapy researchers are detailing their designs, interventions, protocols, and statistical methods in order to maintain the highest research standards. 


* EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICACY
* As a result of external and internal pressure to present evidence of psychotherapy treatment, the American Psychological Association (APA) Division 12 Task Force on Promotion and Dissemination of Psychological Procedures issued the first major list of empirically supported treatments in 1995 (Chorpita, 2003
* The most articulated controversy regarding the identification of evidence-based treatments or empirically supported treatments, however, is the possible distinction between clinical trials and real-world interventions: efficacy versus effectiveness. 
* and comparison of the intervention to a placebo or another treatment. Currently, this website lists four major types of disorders, including anxiety disorders, depression, attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder, and conduct/oppositional problems. Several of the listed disorders identify no Best Support or Promising treatments, indicating the need for additional research on these and other diagnoses.
* that currently no play therapy approaches are considered by Division 53 as Best Support or Promising.


* _EFFECTIVENESS OF PLAY THERAPY_
* the strength of play therapy research appears to be in the history of and continued ability to conduct successful play therapy studies in natural real-world settings of schools, hospitals, clinics, and shelters
* Although conducting research in the school setting presents the researcher with difficulties in controlling research groups and facilitating treatment as dictated by a protocol, it offers the
* practitioner a practical method for replicating treatment if it is discovered that treatment was effective
* As evidenced by the play therapy research, researchers have attempted to provide services to a large number of children, including criteria such as, for example, “children who are identified by parents and/or teachers as exhibiting behavioral problems
* This broader inclusion pattern allows the researcher to serve children who are experiencing problems but possibly not identified with a specific diagnosis or not exhibiting only criteria tied to a specific diagnosis. Although
* Treatment provided in school-setting studies can be replicated and provided by a full-time counselor, psychologist, or social worker in the public school setting
* several studies cited with children in hospital settings were conducted with children receiving other hospital services who might benefit from a play therapy treatment provided by hospital staff to reduce their anxiety
* Shelters are perhaps the most difficult settings in which to conduct research, yet Kot et al
* Brandt (2001) demonstrated the impact of play therapy on children who received services from a mental health clinic that served clients of low income and education level.
* Additional strengths of play therapy research include the ability to demonstrate effectiveness with younger age groups and diverse populations
* Play therapy researchers have sought to investigate play not only as a developmental intervention, but also as a universal language for children. Garza and Bratton (2005) demonstrated the positive effects of play therapy on problem behaviors for a sample of all Hispanic children, mostly identified as Mexican American
* Trostle (1988) found that after 10 sessions of nondirective group play therapy, bilingual Puerto Rican children showed significant improvement in self-control and higher developmental level play behaviors when compared to their control group peer.
* Research in play therapy has shown effectiveness in natural settings, with younger children, and with diverse groups of children
* There are few other interventions that can boast a lengthy history of research with consistent positive results across a variety of populations and presenting problems.


* _EFFICACY OF PLAY THERAPY_
* The meta-analyses have helped the intervention of play therapy move toward the goal of efficacy. Chambless and Hollon (1998) provided a comprehensive description of efficacy to demonstrate that treatment benefits are due to the effects of the treatment and not to chance or confounding factors such as passage of time, effects of psychological assessment, or presence of different types of clients in the various treatment conditions
* Sound methodology includes, but is not limited to, specificity in sample population description, selection of instruments that measure the specific focus of the population, follow up methods, assessment of clinical significance, use of treatment manuals, monitoring of treatment protocol, and credible data analysis. Efficacy can be established through group design methods or single-case experiments.
* play therapy researchers can attempt to address issues noted by the narrow definitions of efficacy in order to strengthen the efficacy base of play therapy.
* there appeared to exist three main criteria in which play therapy research has not aligned itself with the psychotherapy research on efficacy: manualization of treatment, specificity of population, and replication of studies.


* _MANUALIZATION OF TREATMENT_
* Possibly, play therapists have hesitated in using manuals because of the need to respond to each client as needed, but manuals are not required to be step-by-step outlines of session 
* manuals can describe “broad principles and phases of treatment with examples of interventions consistent with these notions 
* This type of manual allows the play therapy researcher to define treatment according to theoretical principles and offer specific interventions to describe those principles, but it also allows for freedom in meeting the needs of the client through the principles outlined in the manual
* Adherence to treatment is a critical piece of conducting solid research, and it has been shown that without monitoring, researchers will drift from manualized treatments
* The use of trained observers who establish an acceptable level of inter-rater reliability to observe random sessions ensures that research protocol is being followed and is indeed responsible for outcome changes


* _SPECIFICITY IN SAMPLE POPULATION DESCRIPTION_
* Play therapy research has greatly improved in the reporting of sex, age, ethnicity, and other distinguishing characteristics, yet improvement has not been made in the area of distinguishing presenting problems and symptoms.
* Although limiting to the number who can participate in research and the number of children who are served, identifying specific problems and examining only those problems will help build efficacy research in play therapy. This can be accomplished through the identification of DSM-IV diagnoses in children, then measuring the impact of play therapy on those diagnose 
* Hence, it is recommended that play therapy researchers attempt to study the effects of play therapy on grouped behaviors, such as hyperactivity, depressive problems, and anxiety problem
* Instead of measuring problematic behavior of children according to the total problems score on the CBCL, a researcher could simply identify children who score borderline or clinically significant on the subscale of attention problems or aggressive problems. 
* Creating specificity in play therapy research helps the field to acknowledge how effective play therapy is with specific presenting problems. 

* _REPLICATION OF PLAY THERAPY STUDIES_
* At this juncture, replication with loose research definitions and parameters is not particularly beneficial to the play therapy research.
* Although play therapy does not have to meet these stringent requirements to be considered promising, best support treatments are marked by their manualization, specification of sample, and replication of results.
* The field of psychotherapy has pressured the field of play therapy to prove its worth.

* _CONCLUSION_
* Play therapy has been demonstrated to improve the self-concepts of children, decrease anxious behaviors, lessen externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors, and increase social adjustment.
* An overall summarization of play therapy research over 60 years provides evidence that play therapy has a large beneficial treatment effect over comparison or nontreatment groups. Specific research studies are cited and reviewed in this chapter to reveal the overall impact of play therapy intervention
* The strength of play therapy research lies in its application to real-world settings that validate play therapy as a usable model in working with real clients.
