# Trauma exposure and its impact on play

* The myriad of outcomes associated with significant trauma exposure include difficulty regulating affect and impulses, disengagement and low motivation for rewarding activities, difficulties with attention, low self-awareness, damaged sense of self, difficulty with peers, and exaggerated threat reactivity.
* These symptoms may manifest in play in the following ways:
* Benign fouls or small incidents escalating to full-blown arguments and even physical violence 
* Lack of self-awareness about feelings and how they are acting 
* A player quitting a competition or even the team for a seemingly minor situation 
* Inability to make friends or form pro-social relationships with teammates or coaches 
* Struggle to play by the rules when things don’t go the player’s way 
* Inability to handle the pressure of a high-stakes competition or handling a loss 
* Lack of focus or concentration
* Sports allow opportunities for developing competence in a rewarding atmosphere and require perseverance and practice. Sports can also provide important socialization and a sense of positive group identity and focus on the future.
* A trauma-informed coach can support these skills by providing direct, explicit feedback on how one’s behavior impacts play; on strengths and challenges; and on analyzing problems. This work happens within the context of a positive alliance between player and coach.


# Role of Trauma Sensitive Play

* Young individuals who have experienced trauma often perceive the world as an unsafe place, which manifests as hypersensitivity to anything that may threaten safety. Therefore, it is imperative to design a youth program centered on emotional and physical safety, particularly in terms of what safety means for each child. 
* In addition to safety, long-term engagement is also crucial since short-term programs can re-activate traumatic memories when the intervention ends, and it can take some time before a young individual affected by trauma may settle into the program experience to be able to gain any benefits. 
* The third fundamental focus of a trauma-sensitive sports program is attachment, which is defined as the meaningful relationships one forms with others, where the attachment figure supports the self-regulation and sense of safety. 
* Structural factors, such as program rules, a predictable schedule of activities, and a reasonable coach to participant ratio, inherent in any youth activity, create and maintain security, safety, and control while also providing expectations for prosocial behavior. 
* The final and most fundamental principle that all sports programs should have is integration with local cultural practices. It is essential for the youth worker to understand the particular context within which players are living and to have a comprehensive understanding of how this context and local culture(s) impact the players’ understanding and experience with trauma. This integration is primary for three reasons: managing trauma and grief varies by culture; adding local cultural elements can increase feelings of familiarity and safety, and incorporating local cultural creates a program that is more integrated and sustainable in the community.

## Trauma Sensitive Design

* There are three main concepts that build upon common existing curriculum features: play, skills, and strengths. 
	* Play can lead to the development of competency, executive functioning, and a positive sense of self, which are all crucial in the process of recovery from traumatic experiences. Play activities allow children who have experienced trauma to lessen anxiety and depression and enhance their capacity for pleasure and desire. 
	*  A skills-based focus has been adopted in many treatment approaches and is key in allowing kids to develop competencies in different areas, which can then serve as a platform for identifying strengths. 
	* Identifying and emphasizing strengths can then build efficacy and self-esteem, which is crucial for children with trauma exposure who are often overwhelmed with feelings of guilt, blame, fear, and anxiety.
* Activating the support of primary caregivers in efforts to leverage the power of attachment is critical. This can happen in two ways: direct support to caregivers through skill building sessions and providing referrals or integration in the program as a trained fan, team manager, or assistant coach.
* Staff working with this type of population may be prone to “burn out” given the high levels of stress, particularly in areas with high community need. Some individuals drawn to working in this population may have also experienced trauma themselves and, in these cases, it is crucial to provide additional support for staff from both within and outside of the program. Staff should be provided with both trauma and sports trainings to help them deliver the best experiences possible.

## Trauma sensitive player skills for youth workers:

* Mindfulness is a skill that can counteract the trauma reactions of dissociation and emotional numbing by allowing players to recognize stressors and sources of comfort. One example of using this skill would be using specific words to name feelings that come up while playing, like “I felt embarrassed when I missed that shot.”
* For some young people, showing up to the program may represent a significant commitment. It is important to recognize the choice to attend and the potential obstacles that young person may have had to overcome to attend, despite behavior while participating. 
* Choosing to engage in sports can help a child learn focusing skills, which can help manage triggers and distractions associated with trauma.
* “Checking yourself” is a self-regulation strategy that allows a child “to identify, modulate, and express his or her internal experience”. While playing sports, this can be taught by asking the child to identify his or her emotion and helping the child see which ways of reacting are helpful and which are destructive. These skills lead to the skill of “recognizing and making choices,” which particularly pertains to the flight, fight, or freeze reactions we see with trauma. In these instances, the coach should help the child gain awareness of these decisions and recognize the practice of making choices. 
* In addition to having difficulty identifying emotions, children who have experienced trauma also struggle with connecting with those emotions. “Speaking your truth” is a skill that can be used to help children connect internally and externally in the moment by learning how to describe their personal experience. 
* Teaching children to understand the difference between good and bad stress and to take breaks from bad stress and stay with good stress are crucial skills for individuals who have experienced trauma and tend to exhibit a hyper-sensitive stress response to all stress 
* Helping a child “play to their strengths” by first identifying and then cultivating those strengths is a crucial piece in challenging the “inherent invalidation” of the traumatic experience.
* Along this line, coaches need to teach the players to “reframe” their experiences from a more positive angle by helping them to view mistakes while playing in a less self-critical way. Coaches are a major source of support, but one of the most important skills they can teach players is how to support themselves through the skill of “self-coaching.” 
* Sports programs also give trauma exposed children an opportunity to “be a friend” helping to challenge the isolation prone behaviors that are commonly seen with trauma while also increasing pro-social behavior and relationship building skills. 
* “Making community contributions” is a skill in which the coach teaches the players the importance of actions that help better the team or community rather than just the individual. This skill allows players to feel connected and useful in social relationship.

##  Program Practices

* Coaching in pairs helps to increase the capabilities for one-on-one attention as well as the level of support for the players and coaches, especially during times when one person may be escalating in behavior and requires one-on-one support. 
* Children who have experienced trauma have hypersensitivity to uncertainty and the dangers it can bring. In this regard, a consistent practice plan is a crucial ingredient. This consistent practice plan should include thoughtful transitions, a body and brain-based warm-up and cool-down, integrated rhythmic movements, intervals of both high activity and recovery, teaching mindful breathing, and teaching simple meditation/ visualization.  
* Establishing a clear and collaborative behavior code for players and coaches is key to establishing consistent conduct. The code should emphasize interpersonal behaviors like how to treat teammates and opposing team members, how to handle escalating situations, and expectations around participation. 
* In order to establish consistent structure and incorporate local culture, coaches must establish and practice positive traditions such as cheers, warm-ups, or wearing team gear in games and practices. 
* Coaches must create opportunities for the players to do “good” for the team, which could include setting up or carrying equipment or leading warm-ups. By learning they can make a positive contribution to the team, players are gaining a much-needed sense of efficacy and relevance. 
* Along these lines, it is important for coaches to plan for intentional connectivity through designing activities inside and outside of the sport that encourage close teamwork and communication; working hard inside the sport experience to ensure that every player can leave with that powerful protective layer of peer friendship. 
* In addition to making time for close interaction, also make time for personal reflection by designing the practices to include a time in which players meet in a circle and check-in, both individually and as a group.  
* During practices and games, focus on skill development which includes breaking down, repeating, and practicing the skill. This will create new neural pathways separate from ones associated with traumatic stress reactions. Practice and repetition is the pathway for building new habits. 
* If competition is not having the desired effect, then consider changing the game. Adding timeouts in sports that do not traditionally have them or incorporating referees into team discussions are two ways to increase safety and time for reflection. Each sport has a certain “way” it is played, and our models for these ways of playing sport often come from the professional or collegiate levels. It is critical to remind ourselves that we are using the sport experience primarily toward a set of youth development outcomes, making it important to take the assertive and creative approach of tinkering with the game itself to help achieve the desired outcomes.


# Trauma sensitive coaching techniques



* Lead with C.L.E.A.R. communication: (a)Calming Voice and Tone. (b) Listen Deeply. (c) Explain HOW and WHY You are Doing What You’re Doing. (d) Ask Engaging Questions. (e) Reduce Outside “Noise.”
* Zero in on one skill at a time: As youth become more used to, and then more proficient at, one skill, their sense of competency will grow. Whenever possible, try to help players focus on one specific skill and show them how to measure their progress in mastering that skill and celebrating growth. This is called “getting a win.”
* Encourage expression: Expression does not have to be verbal. A nonverbal cue such as a thumbs up or thumbs down can allow participants to share their feelings in an unintimidating way.
* Offer opt outs and opt ins: The coach provides players with opportunities to “stop the clock” of practice or competition and choose how they want to participate. “Choice” or “invitation” language is particularly helpful in setting the stage for participant decisions on whether to opt out or not. As its name implies, this type of language is phrased so that players have a choice in their level of participation. Choice language is focused on effort, not outcome, so it does not continuously push for more. An example of choice language is “If this is uncomfortable, you can take a break and then try again.”
* Ask review and “looking back” questions: By asking questions such as, “What were you thinking or feeling in that situation?” you encourage participants to think back to their emotional state, look at how they responded, and think of other possible responses. These kinds of “thinking questions” help young people affected by trauma to engage with higher level functions in the brain and mitigate escalating feelings and behaviors
* Focus on progress not performance: In a trauma-sensitive program, the focus should be on the developmental and rehabilitative aspects of a player’s experience in the sport. In many cases, it may be a long time before a player gets to the point of actually playing competitive sport.
* Coach the bench, praise the play: As a coach, it is natural to direct most of your attention and active coaching toward the players currently in the competition. This is detrimental to young people affected by trauma for two reasons: First, they are already experiencing a level of pressure in the competition, and to develop their own competency in managing stress and making decisions they need practice making these decisions on their own. Second, in the midst of a loud competitive setting, a coach shouting instructions to a player often sounds just like someone shouting angrily which can have its own detrimental effect.
* Respond quickly during changes: The moment of substitution is one of the most crucial in sport for young people affected by trauma. In that moment, they could be quick to assume they have made a major mistake or are somehow underperforming to merit a substitution. You may very well be taking them out of the competition because of their performance, but there could also be a host of other reasons for the substitution.
* Design an individual competition schedule: Some players cannot handle the rigors and pressure of a full practice or competition. In situations where we cannot change the game to meet players at a level of competition and play they can handle, we also have the opportunity to change the individual schedule for players to help set them up for success. Sit with the player and make a plan for how and when they will be playing. Help them understand how the competition will flow. Then, during the competition, keep them informed about their schedule. For this player, knowing there is 30 seconds left in his or her shift before a break can help him or her focus on self-regulating emotions and behavior.
* Seize on situations that merit reframing: Reframing is a special conversation with a player in which you share your specific view on a recent situation. Players are telling themselves a story that is overly negative and self-critical. However, you offer an alternative, more positive view on the same situation. You are not changing the reality of the situation. However, you are showing players a way to look at their situations that is more hopeful, reveals a hidden strength or positive outcome, and is truthful.
* Be available for informal time: While you should practice intentional connectivity and look to interact with your players throughout practice/competition time, sometimes the most valuable opportunity for building relationship is the time before and after practices/competitions. Make it a habit to stop preparing for practice 15 minutes ahead of time and to hang around after practice.
* Support good stress, stop bad stress: Good stress is stress that motivates players, helps them focus, and is at a level of intensity they can generally handle. Bad stress is overwhelming, triggers players toward negative responses, and often causes poor performance. One of the most important skills players need to work on is differentiating between good and bad stress and being able to develop their overall ability to handle stress. Coaches can help players mitigate bad stress by making them aware of their negative reactions, helping them articulate their feelings under pressure, encouraging them to take a break (opt outs), or even substituting them out of competition.
* Invite their input on how to make the experience better: Ask players how things are going and encourage their input on a regular basis. They may be able to share with you something you have missed to help them have an even more positive experience. Seeking their input may help them take more control of their experience, which is a central component of making sport an experience that contributes to a player’s healing


# Limitations of this approach



* Competitive sport is not necessarily a positive experience for all participants, and there are real limitations to when and where competitive sports can have efficacy in trauma work. Recreational games and body-based movement activities, in particular, yoga and dance, may prove more effective. We acknowledge that to generalize a trauma-sensitive sports approach for the many different kinds of 251 populations and the different types of trauma they can experience can present limitations. However, we have seen for frontline programs, there is value in attempting to create a general framework. 
* Adopting a trauma-sensitive approach does not replace the need that many young people have for more formal clinical care. This special approach is intended to support the existing design of your sport intervention. Specific populations require specific adaptations of this approach. Whenever possible, a qualified trauma specialist should be engaged in the design, monitoring, and evaluation of your program.
