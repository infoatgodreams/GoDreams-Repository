# Brief:

* Scope & Description: This resource highlights the role played by Free Play on social, emotional, cognitive, and physical well-being of children beginning in early childhood and why children living in poverty don’t have access to spaces that allow free play. It further explores the role played by pediatricians and offers suggestions to promote free play.

* Gold Standard Inputs & Outcomes: The US Department of Education in 2009 announced the Race to the Top Program, an education initiative that financially rewards school districts that support improving social, cognitive, physical, and emotional school readiness of disadvantaged students. In bids to receive the rewards, school districts must demonstrate focused programs that prepare students in the core academic subjects and other subjects that contribute to the development of wellrounded students.

# Importance of Free Play in Child Development
* Play is essential in developing social and emotional ties.
* It allows parents to “listen” in a very different, but productive, way. When parents observe their children playing or join them in child-driven play, they can view the world through their child’s eyes and, therefore, may learn to communicate or offer guidance more effectively.
* Play also helps forge connections between children. It allows them to learn how to share, to negotiate and resolve conflicts, and to learn self-advocacy skills when necessary.
* Children who are not involved in play actively take part in sedentary activities which causes a lot of health problems such as obesity that further leads to more complex health issues.

# Factors that reduce Free Play for Children in Poverty
* Access to recess and other in-school creative and physical outlets (eg, physical education, art, music), as well as after-school youth development programs are reduced. 
* Second, out-of-school opportunities for play may be compromised by a lack of safe play areas, because parks and playgrounds are less abundant in lower-income areas and, in some cases, may be unsafe because of drug dealing, violence, and vandalism. 
* Because lower-income parents have to deal with additional social, emotional, and economic stressors of daily living, they may have less time, energy, and resources available to provide active and creative playtime at the park, playground, or even in the home.
* Schools, under pressure to increase academic performance and to decrease the achievement gap of students, have increased direct educational time, including after-school enrichment and tutorial programs.

# Suggestions
* In schools, the need to support social and emotional learning and healthy child development must be held alongside the need to increase academic scores. Otherwise, school engagement might suffer and efforts at creating a better-prepared generation might fail.
* Supervised after-school programs can be critical to children who live in communities where outside playing might be dangerous or unsupervised. Community-based programs that offer a wide variety of services, ranging from homework assistance to athletic programs and from character development to the creative arts can contribute heavily to the positive development of youth.
* Keeping school facilities open for use by community families in the evenings and on weekends when they are usually closed may increase engagement in these activities.

# Role of Pediatricians:
Because play contributes substantially to the healthy development and well-being of children, it is important that pediatricians promote the inclusion of play in homes, schools, and communities

1. Educating parents: Pediatricians can educate the parents about the need of free play; and about the available inexpensive toys such as dolls, jump ropes, blocks, etc. that allows children to be more creative. They can encourage parents to use love and understanding to encourage children to try again even when at first they fail. Parents must also be educated about the negative impact of media exposure on children and encourage them to limit screen time and substitute other activities, including playtime and outdoor activities, for screen time
2. Pediatricians can advocate for safe play spaces for children who live in communities and attend schools with a high proportion of low-income and poor children by emphasizing that the lifelong success of children is based on their ability to be creative and to apply the lessons learned from playing.
3. Pediatricians may advocate for policies that reduce educational disparities while supporting the inclusion of recess, physical outlets, and the creative arts as means to enhance social and emotional learning and school engagement.
