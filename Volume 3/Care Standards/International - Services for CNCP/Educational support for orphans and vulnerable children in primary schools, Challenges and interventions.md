# Orphans and vulnerable children (OVC)

* A joint report by the United Nations Program on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) and United States Agency for International Development (USAID) (2004) maintain that millions of children can be described as vulnerable due to the effects of illness, poverty, conflict, disease and accidents
* According to USAID & Catholic Relief Services (CRS) (2008), orphans are defined as children aged under 18 years who have lost either one or both parents while vulnerable children are defined as children whose safety, well-being or development is at significant risk.


# Challenges faced by Orphans and Vulnerable Children

* According to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals evaluation report 2013 “Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest rate of children leaving school early in the world with slightly more than two out of five children who started primary school in 2010 who will not make it into the last grade” (UN, 2013, p.16).
* UNICEF (2009) maintains that addressing the educational rights and needs of OVC in Sub-Saharan Africa presents new opportunities and challenges that need attention. With the abolition of school fees in public primary schools in Sub-Saharan Africa, many children are enrolled in schools.
* Due to HIV/AIDS, the traditional structure of households is changing in affected communities, leaving vulnerable children to adapt to non-traditional families and poverty (Ebersohn & Eloff, 2002). Ebersohn and Eloff note that when parents die, some orphans are left under the care of aged grandparents or under older siblings to care for them.
* Fleming further argued that maternal and double orphans are more discriminated against in accessing education than paternal orphans (Fleming, 2015; Case et al, 2004).
* Vulnerable children from child-headed households are burdened with domestic and economic responsibilities, which in turn affect their participation in education in relation to attend and succeed in school (Fleming, 2015).
* As the number of OVC grows, communities become less and less capable of addressing all their basic needs, including their ability to go to school (UNICEF, 2009)
* Interventions to overcome educational challenges are therefore critical as education gives a child hope for life and work and is a strong protector against HIV to which these children may be susceptible
* South Africa being a signatory to the Dakar Framework for Action of 2000, and to a number of other international agreements, is committed to combating poverty and uplifting people through the provision of basic education (Republic of South Africa, 2003). The government has made basic education compulsory for all children of school going age. It is to be of good quality and in which financial capacity is not a barrier to access to any child (Republic of South Africa, 2003).
* The most complicated challenge is how to support the growing number of OVC made vulnerable by the direct and indirect effects of HIV/AIDS on their households (Open Society Foundation Education Support Program (OSFESP), and Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa, (OSISA), 2012). 


# Educational support 

* Education as recognised in the convention on the rights of the child is a basic human right for all children (Committee on the Rights of the Child, 1989). A child who has access to quality primary schooling has a better chance in life. 
* A child who knows how to read and write and do basic arithmetic has a solid foundation for continued learning throughout life (USAID & CRS, 2008).
* They further observe that education benefits individuals and the whole nation as a major instrument for social and economic development (USAID & CRS, 2008)
* Hallfors et al (2011) pointed out that supporting adolescent girls to stay in school increases their chances of remaining in school, hence reducing chances of contracting HIV through early marriage. This intervention further reduces chances of girls dropping out of school
* Kelly (2002) maintained that formal school education is a powerful tool for transforming\ poverty in an environment where HIV/AIDS are rampart. He further argued that growth in education may positively influence growth out of poverty.
* Schools not only benefit the child but can serve as important resource centres to meet the broader needs of the community (PEPFAR, 2006). “Education is likely to lead to employability and can foster a child developing a sense of competence” (PEPFAR, 2006, p. 9). 
* However, Wood and Goba (2011) in their study noted that teachers perceived themselves as not adequately prepared to deal with issues affecting OVC.
* USAID and CRS (2008) point out that basic education in primary and secondary levels contribute to the reduction of poverty. It increases labour productivity, improves health and enables people to participate fully in the economy and the development of their societies.
* Thus OVC need educational interventions as they are at risk of becoming infected with HIV due to economic hardships, reduced parental care and protection and increased susceptibility to abuse, and exploitation.


# Theoretical framework 

* This article is anchored on the theoretical underpinnings of Bronfenbrenner’s bioecological systems theory which holds that development reflects the influence of several environmental systems. 
* Bronfenbrenner conceptualised the child’s environment as having different interconnected layers nested together with agents that influence the child’s development with varying degrees of directness (McGuckin & Minton, 2014). 
* Parental/guardian support for OVC in this case will have a direct relationship on how the child performs in school and at home. Bronfenbrenner (1979) maintained that the family influences all aspects of a child’s development including language, nutrition, security, health and beliefs.
* OVC however, may not have such an advantage due to the challenges they go through both at home and in school that are likely to impact negatively in their education. Thus requiring education interventions that would enable them overcome these challenges.


# Research methodology

* A mixed method approach involving descriptive and qualitative designs were utilised in this study (Creswell, 2012, Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). Self-report questionnaires for learners and educators were designed to capture both descriptive and qualitative data concurrently through structured and unstructured questions.
* The study was carried out in public primary schools in Soweto. The study targeted public primary schools since OVC cannot afford the cost in private schools
* The OVC in grade seven who participated in the study were aged between ten and sixteen years with majority aged twelve (33.8%) and thirteen (36.9%)
* Questionnaires for educators and learners were utilised to seek information on educational support provided for OVC, with a focus on the challenges experienced by teachers in supporting these children.
* The questionnaires were validated using “respondent validation” (Silverman, 2001, p. 235) where participants in the pilot were taken through their responses in the questionnaire to establish whether the questions and responses matched their own experiences.
* A triangulation of data sources (descriptive and qualitative data from structured and unstructured questions) and respondents (learners and teachers) were utilised to enhance reliability of the findings (Creswell, 2012; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998).
* Data from structured questions were captured into the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) which were processed and presented in descriptive statistics involving frequencies and percentages on tables ready for analysis.
* Qualitative data were analysed alongside descriptive data to provide an overview of the educational support, challenges and possible interventions to mitigate the identified challenges.


# Results and discussions of the findings


## Provision of educational support for OVC

* National economic development can be enhanced by investing in quality education where there are enough teachers and educational learning tools for children (Baxen, Nsubuga & Botha 2014; Robeyns, 200; Tikly, 2011).
* Our study revealed that the government through the implementation of a no fee policy in schools, enabled OVC to access their basic education. This was confirmed by 57 (88%) learners indicating that the government paid their fees and 48 (74%) learners indicating that this support enabled many of them to access education.
* Findings further revealed that schools through the government soup kitchens provided meals to OVC where 63 (96%) learners and 38 (90.5%) teachers confirmed this fact.
* It is observable from the above findings that the department of education, the schools andnother stakeholders have done their best to ensure that OVC in public primary schools are supported to acquire their basic education.
* However, looking at the percentages, one can tell that there is a small percentage of OVC who are not getting the kind of support reported.


## Challenges in providing educational support for OVC


### Teacher’s support for OVC

* Schools and other educational service providers have always been aware of children or adolescents in their midst struggling to stay in school due to difficult or even catastrophic life circumstances (OSFESP & OSISA, 2012).
* Findings from our study indicated that the challenges deterring teachers from supporting OVC include lack of sufficient time for individual attention to OVC. As one teacher said, “we have no sufficient time to support individual children” (T2SA)
* Wood and Goba (2011) noted that teachers trained in life orientation felt a sense of being marginalised by their colleagues who left OVC for them to deal with. On the other hand OVC experienced stigma which was challenging for life orientation teachers who could not prevent it from happening.
* Reading and writing were other challenges that OVC struggled with. Twenty six (40%) learners reported that they were not able to write like other children while 14 (23%) indicated they were not able to read like others.
* This challenge could be connected to lack of sufficient time for teachers to attend to learners individually, leaving OVC struggling on their own.
* Lack of concentration among OVC, submitting school work late and not doing their school/homework were other challenges cited as likely to have negative influence on OVC’s education.
* Mwoma & Pillay (2015) noted that parents/guardians were not supportive to OVC in relation to homework. Pillay (2011) revealed that learners from child headed households lacked support and they mostly had negative experiences in their homes characterised by abject poverty.
* Low self-esteem among OVC was found to be a contributing factor to poor performance in education as T6SA said “self-esteem is … related to low morale and their performances are disturbed”.
* Absenteeism and lateness to school were other challenges likely to negatively influence OVC’s academic performance.
* Mishra and Bignami-Van Assche (2008) revealed that various reasons could make OVC be at greater risk of absenteeism and dropping out of school. The reasons according to them would include inability to pay fees, need to help with household labour or having to stay at home to care for sick parents or younger children.
* The reasons given could attempt to explain why OVC in our study could not attend school regularly which is likely to impact negatively in their performance in education


### School feeding program

* Food and nutrition are important components for OVC’s support (PEPFAR, 2006). USAID and CRS (2008) pointed out that school feeding programs can enable children in general and OVC in particular to access education by addressing hunger and the need to work to survive. Findings from our study revealed that although schools had feeding programs, some OVC lacked meals in their homes compelling them to come to school without having breakfast.
* Eight (12%) learners also confirmed this fact that OVC did not have meals at home. Due to lack of food at home, some OVC would even come to school when they were sick to have one meal a day provided in school. 
* Some schools are trying to provide food parcels for OVC to take home, but they experience further challenges in providing enough for family members. For others some OVC lacked lunch boxes to carry the food home.


### Support from guardians/parents

* Ebersohn and Eloff, (2002) observed that due to the death of parents and close relatives as a result of HIV/AIDS, families have been disrupted causing an increase of destitute and abandoned children in South Africa.
* This was supported by findings from our study where OVC were reported to be relocating from relative to relative while others could not do their homework indicating that they lacked supervision and support in their home.
* Cleanliness among OVC was another challenge indicating that OVC are not supervised at home to ensure personal hygiene. Being the first teachers and protectors of their children, parents have a primary responsibility of ensuring that children have a conducive social environment at home.
* Bronfenbrenner (1979) identified the home as the microsystem where children are socialised to learn how to interact with other social agents in society. Supervision of children by parents/guardians ensures that children become responsible and are not rendered vulnerable to the law by becoming violent to other children or by destroying property (Sund, 2006). 
* Supervision at home could include ensuring that children are encouraged to do home/schoolwork, observe personal hygiene, and that parents/guardians work hand in hand with teachers to ensure that OVC attend school regularly as these were major negative challenges reported to be influencing the education for OVC


## Intervention strategies in providing educational support for OVC
* Bronfenbrenner (1979) through his ecological systems theory argued that the ecological systems surrounding the child directly or indirectly influence his/her development.
* The system represents the family, school, the government and the culture and each of these play a role directly or indirectly in the child’s education.
* Neal and Neal (2013) maintained that these systems are networked where each system is defined in terms of the social relationships surrounding the child and the different levels relating to one another in an overlapping but non-nested way. They further argued that the family is a microsystem where the child has direct experiences and interactions with family members face to face. Mesosystem according to them, could involve the interaction between the parents and teachers about the child’s behaviour both at home and in school in relation to his/her education (Neal & Neal, 2013).
* Therefore, in coming up with intervention strategies, the family, the school and the government will play a key role in ensuring that OVC are supported to acquire quality basic education. 


### Supporting OVC with school work
* Mwoma & Pillay (2015) maintained that in supporting OVC, life orientation skills are critical for OVC especially those taking care of their ailing parents/guardians. However this support was missing as 54% of the teachers and 31% of the OVC indicated that they are not taught how to care for sick persons at home, implying the children struggle on their own. This may have indirect influence on their participation in education as they may not attend school regularly or do homework. 
* Among the strategies identified that could be used to improve support for OVC with school work at the meso and exosystem levels is the need for government to employ more teachers to support OVC after school hours.
* Participants also suggested that there should be a social worker in each school, to whom OVC could be referred for further support.
* Findings further indicated that for OVC to be supported effectively there is need for a collective responsibility from teachers, parents/guardians, and government to ensure that OVC are supported in their educational needs. Each of these stakeholders should play their roles effectively to support OVC both at home and in school in line with Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) findings that the home, the school, the government and the community at large have a critical role in a child’s development and learning.


### Provision of feeding programs 
* Feeding children is very important in ensuring that they have energy to play and learn and have good health. Findings from our study indicated that some children came to school without breakfast, indicating that they could be starving at home. To mitigate this, interviewees suggested that there is a need to provide food parcels for OVC to take home.
* USAID and CRS (2008) maintain that take home rations have been shown to promote participation, progression and retention of OVC in education. They further argue that, children who are not hungry are better able to concentrate in class. Therefore, providing food parcels for OVC is critical in ensuring that they do not go to school hungry. 


### Support for OVC from guardians/parents
* McGuckin and Minton (2014) in supporting the ecological systems theory maintain that the environment in which a child grows up, plays a critical role in shaping the relationship between the child and his/her development. The family, school and neighbourhood has the most and earliest influence on the child’s development (Krishnan, 2010).
* Thus providing the educational needs for OVC by family members and the school community is important in enhancing the educational performance of OVC.
* Findings from our study revealed that, in order for OVC to get adequate support from guardians/parents there is a need for workshops to sensitise them to the need to fully support OVC with school/homework and to supervise their personal hygiene at home.
* PEPFAR (2006) maintained that supporting families helps build a protective environment for vulnerable children. Krishnan (2010) also pointed out that what happens in a microsystem such as home where a child lives, could influence what happens in the school and vice versa. It is imperative therefore, that capacity building for guardians/parents on the importance of supporting children under their care while at home and in school is an option that cannot be overlooked.
* Regular home visits by social workers was another strategy deemed to be supportive especially for social workers to identify the various needs of OVC alongside the needs of parents/guardians with a view of identifying the appropriate ways of meeting those needs.
* Identifying needy guardians/parents for OVC and providing them with social grants was another strategy cited to ensure that they are able to purchase necessities for these children to promote their personal hygiene.


# Key takeaways
* We would argue that although the government has supported OVC through a no fee policy, provision of learning materials and feeding programs, more needs to be done such as engaging teachers from the community to cope with the high numbers of OVC reported in public schools.
* Therefore introducing feeding programs at home will ensure continuity of OVC having enough food at home and in school to promote their health and learning.
* Absenteeism from school and lateness may have negative impact on OVC’s academic performance. Research confirms that orphans from different countries in Sub-Saharan Africa including South Africa, experience lower school attendance than non-orphans (Bhargava, 2005, Case & Ardington, 2006, Operario et al., 2008).
* This requires government through schools to sensitise parents/guardians on the importance of sending OVC to school regularly and supervising them in their homework.
