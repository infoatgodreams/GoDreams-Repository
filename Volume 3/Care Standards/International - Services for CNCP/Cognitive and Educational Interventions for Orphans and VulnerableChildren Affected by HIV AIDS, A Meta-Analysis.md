# Brief:
* Scope & Description: Orphans and vulnerable children affected by HIV/AIDS (HIV OVC) are at risk for cognitive difficulties and lack of access to education. This review examined the summative effectiveness of interventions and the specific effects of participant age and intervention length. Interventions targeting cognitive outcomes had a small, significant effect, with no effect of moderating variables.Interventions targeting educational outcomes had significant effects. Educational interventions over 1 year were effective, but effects of intervention length were not significant.

# Need for interventions for HIV OVCs

* In both perinatally HIV-infected and HIV-exposed uninfected youth, caregiver resources predict cognitive functioning, and higher cognitive functioning is in turn associated with better caregiver-reported behavioral functioning
* Orphans and vulnerable children affected by HIV and AIDS (HIV OVC) are defined as children who are orphaned by AIDS, living with a family member infected with HIV/AIDS, or children who have HIV/AIDS themselves (USAID, 2016.
* Children affected by HIV/AIDS may also show deficits in cognitive and academic functioning, due to the lack of access to schooling as well as other factors such as stigma, poverty, trauma, family loss, lack of cognitive stimulation, and mental health problems
* In both perinatally HIV-infected and HIV-exposed uninfected youth,caregiver resources predict cognitive functioning, and higher cognitive functioning is in turn associated with better caregiver-reported behavioral functioning.


## Major Cognitive Interventions done till date

* One such cognitive intervention consisted of computerized cognitive rehabilitation (CCRT) delivered in the child’s home in Uganda; it involved cognitive games designed to enhance spatial working memory, vigilance attention, and nonverbal reasoning. This intervention was meant to directly improve neurocognitive development.
* Another intervention was also delivered in Uganda (Boivin et al., 2017); it relied on the Mediational Intervention for Sensitizing Caregivers (MISC), where caregivers are trained to enhance their children’s cognitive development by learning to focus their attention, providing meaning to their experiences, expanding (making them aware of how the learning experience transcends the present situation), encouraging (praising their accomplishment while explaining the reason for their success), and regulating (directing and shaping the child’s behavior according to task requirements).
* Recent systematic review suggests that HIV OVCs experience cognitive delay and that cognitive (direct or indirect) interventions directed at either the child or caregiver have the potential to improve cognitive outcomes.
* another intervention aimed at improving cognitive outcomes that took place in South Africa and consisted of a home stimulation program structured around activities of daily living based on concerns of the caregivers (Potterton, Stewart, Cooper, & Becker, 2010). 
* one intervention delivered in Zimbabwe included parenting classes focusing on health, nutrition, and early childhood stimulation along with an economic strengthening intervention providing savings and lending, and regular visits by village health workers (Mebrahtu et al., 2019). 
* Because HIV OVC are at risk for both lack of schooling (and, subsequently, low educational attainment) and impaired cognition (and subsequently negative life outcomes), we aimed to investigate the impact and effect sizes of interventions specifically for HIV OVC on both cognitive.


## Meta Analysis done in this Review

* The current meta-analysis includes all types of interventions aimed at improving educational or cognitive outcomes (excluding medication regimens in isolation, i.e., the delivery of medication without any behavioral component) and educational outcomes
* Review articles, descriptive studies, opinion pieces, and case studies were excluded.

## Types of Interventions

* Any and all interventions aiming to help OVC affected by HIV and AIDS were included in the review, as long as they measured a cognitive or educational outcome. Interventions consisting only of medication with no behavior support were excluded.


### Types of Extracted Information

* following information was retrieved from all selected studies: (a) participant characteristics, including mean pre-intervention age and number of male and female participants; (b) intervention characteristics, including intervention type and length of the intervention; (c) study characteristics, including sample size and study design (randomized controlled trial, nonrandomized controlled trial, repeated measures study); and (d) outcome indicators, indicating assessment instruments and reported preand posttest variables. 


### Types of Participants

* Cognitive outcomes were generally restricted to indicators of overall cognitive functioning. Educational outcomes varied significantly between studies, with some studies focused on attendance, and others on confidence in plans to attend secondary school.
* To be included, studies had to be conducted with participants under the age of 25. Participants had to be OVC, meeting one of the following criteria: (a) being orphaned due to HIV/AIDS, (b) living with a caregiver who has HIV, or (c) diagnosed with HIV themselves.


### Types of Studies

* We included studies examining the effectiveness of interventions for OVC and tracking at least one outcome related to cognition or education.
* For most studies, the intervention group was comprised of all participants receiving any sort of intervention, and the control group was comprised of all participants not receiving the intervention of interest. One study had a control group consisting of a volunteer community-based program while the intervention involved a paid community-based program (Tomlinson et al., 2017).
* All of these studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, consistent with the location of the vast majority of HIV OVC.
* All studies had an intervention component, as well as a cognitiveor education-related outcome.
* Interventions within this category included a Captains Log CCRT therapy (Sandford, 2007); brain-training exercises designed to improve cognitive skills; a MISC (Klein & Hundeide, 1996), teaching caregivers to focus, excite, expand, encourage, and regulate child behavior to improve motor, cognitive, and psychosocial development of preschool-age children; a home stimulation program (Potterton et al., 2010) revolving around activities of daily living and developmentally appropriate play; parenting classes and economic strengthening (Mebrahtu et al., 2019); and paid community-based interventions.
* Seven studies included educational outcomes, such as school attendance, educational plans for the future, and confidence in achieving educational plans. Most interventions with educational outcomes involved monetary support. One intervention was a paid community-based intervention (Tomlinson et al., 2017).
* The seventh study’s intervention involved services related to education, health, HIV prevention, psychosocial support, and nutrition, delivered at a community center or by home-based caregivers.


## Results: Study Charachteristics


###  Studies with cognitive outcomes

* Ten studies reported cognitive outcomes (see Table 1). Overall, the meta-analysis of the 10 studies evaluating the efficacy of interventions on improving cognitive outcomes yielded a small effect size. 
* When grouped by age groups (over 5 years and under 5 years), results for each group were similar.

### Studies With Education Outcomes

*  Seven of the studies reported educational outcomes (see Table 1), including the proportion of the group that felt confidence in their educational plans, or the proportion of the group that attended school more than 90% of the time.
* An analysis was completed to compare effect sizes for interventions of different length, comparing the effects of interventions that lasted 1 year or less to those that lasted over 1 year. Interventions that were over 1 year (n = 6; OR = 2.55; CI [1.86, 3.51], p = .00) tended to have a greater effect than those that were 1 year or less (n = 2; OR = 2.20; CI [0.81, 6.01], p = .12), but this difference was not significant (Qvalue = .08, p = .78).
* Due to the large sample sizes within studies, post hoc power analyses (a = .05) revealed that the overall cognitive outcomes metaanalysis with a small effect size and high heterogeneity had power of .82; the overall education outcomes meta-analysis with a medium effect size and high heterogeneity had a power of 1.00 (Jackson & Turner, 2017; Valentine et al., 2010)


### Post Hoc Power Analysis

* For the cognitive outcomes, the statistical power for the moderator analyses was high for studies with participants over the age of 5 years (high heterogeneity: 0.97; moderate heterogeneity: 1.00), but low for studies with participants under the age of 5 years because of the smaller effect size in this group (power was 0.19 for high heterogeneity and 0.33 for moderate heterogeneity.
* For the educational outcomes, the statistical power for the moderator analyses ranged from 1.00 for detecting a medium effect size with high heterogeneity for interventions over 1 year, to 0.15 for detecting a medium effect size with high heterogeneity for interventions under 1 year because there were only two studies with shorter interventions


## Discussion after the Meta Analysis

* More research should be done to identify which types of cognitive outcomes were most improved as a result of the intervention, as we only analyzed overall measures of cognition because the specific outcomes examined were variable and too few studies were available to compare specific variables (such as working memory). 
* Specifically, the interventions targeting cognitive outcomes had a small but significant effect in improving performance on indicators of overall cognition. Interventions targeting educational outcomes had a medium effect on improving outcomes such as school attendance and confidence in educational plans.
* HIV OVC tend to demonstrate some vulnerabilities in their cognitive performance, which, in turn, can affect their well-being and motivation at school (Payne, Kohler, Bandawe, Lawler, & Kohler, 2018), and their ability to complete health-related tasks such as adhering to medication.
* In addition, neurocognitive weaknesses, such as difficulties in inhibition, working memory, and/or executive functioning may be related to risky behaviors such as sexual risk behaviors among youth in general.
* While these studies were focused on other populations within developing countries or sub-Saharan Africa, effect sizes for education-related interventions were similar to those found for HIV OVC overall. However, monetary grants were found to be more effective for HIV OVC within the current study, compared to effect sizes close to 0 for educational interventions in developing countries in general (McEwan, 2015).


## Conclusion

* It is possible that for cognitive interventions, shorter interventions may be just as effective as longer ones, which could indicate that the cognitive interventions may be easier and more cost efficient to implement with HIV OVC populations. Cognitive interventions tended to be shorter overall compared to educational interventions, as all interventions were a year or less.
* The interventions addressing cognitive outcomes tended to be shorter, yet may prove more easily implemented on a larger scale. However, the analyses were limited by significant heterogeneity and smaller statistical power for studies including younger participants and interventions of short duration.
* In addition, future research should focus more on which components of interventions are most effective at improving their targeted cognitive and educational outcomes in OVC.
