# Brief:

* Scope & Description: This resource explores the reliability of pre-existing tools available to assess the child care homes and provides suggestions for what should be adopted - essentially a bottom-down approach that keeps in mind the requirements of the individual child.

# Different types of family child care homes


* Child care HOME inventory (CC-HOME)
*  Infant toddler child care HOME (IT-CC HOME)
*  Early childhood care HOME (IT-CC-HOME) &lt;3 yo
*  Early childhood child care HOME (EC-CC-HOME)


# Need for assessing the child care homes

- The goals for assessing the quality of care children receive in non-parental care vary considerably. Not every evaluation of child care is concerned with the “average quality of care available” in a particular setting, as might be the case for those focused on licensing or program improvement. 
- In some instances, administrators or parents simply wish to know the quality of care being received by particular children. If that is the goal, then it may be misleading to infer the level of quality experienced by an individual child from the level of quality present in the entire setting—not all children in the same setting receive equal quality care.
- The essentially “top-down” approach to assessment incorporated in most current measures of family child care (i.e., measures that contain indicators designed to reflect the general quality of care present in the setting as a whole rather than the quality of care available to an individual child) may not be ideal for all research and evaluation purposes, even if the instrument used has generally good technical properties. A “bottom-up” approach to assessing child care quality begins with a focus on what the individual child experiences. 


# Assessment tools available


* Family Day Care Rating Scale (FDCRS) and Infant/Toddler Environment Rating Scale (ITERS) by Harms and Clifford (1984), the PROFILE by Abbott-Shim and Sibley (1993), the Caregiver Interaction Scale by Arnett (1989), the Adult Involvement Scale (AIS) by Howes and Stewart (1987), and the Observational Record of the Caregiving Environment (ORCE) developed by the NICHD Early Child Care Research Network (1996) are some of the tools in use.
* All these tools follow a top-down approach and have a pre-defined rubric that allows to score the child care homes.
