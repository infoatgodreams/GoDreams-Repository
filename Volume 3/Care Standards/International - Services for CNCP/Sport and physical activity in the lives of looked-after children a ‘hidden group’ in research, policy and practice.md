# Brief:

* Scope: Looked-after children are arguably one of the most disadvantaged groups in society and constitute a ‘hidden group’ in relation to sport and physical activity research, policy and practice. Through the use of the mosaic approach and innovative participatory methods, including peer interviewing, the purpose of this paper was to provide an insight into a new area of research in the field of sport and physical activity. The study focuses on two questions (1) What are the sport and physical activity experiences of looked-after children? (2) What meanings and values do looked-after children ascribe to their engagement in sport and physical activity?

* # Introduction
    * looked-after children (a diverse group often subjected to specific forms of vulnerability and social marginalisation) constitute a ‘hidden group’ in relation to sport and physical activity research, policy and practice
    * The term ‘looked-after’ was introduced in England by the Children Act 1989 to refer to those young people who have been removed from their family and placed in the care of local authorities (in children’s homes or foster care1). They may be subject to compulsory care orders or, for various reasons, be accommodated voluntarily at the request of, or by agreement with, their parents [National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), 2012].
    * Looked-after children often experience a disrupted education; in 2006, only 12% achieved 5 A*–C grades at GCSE2 compared to 59% of all children [Department for Education and Skills (DfES), 2007]
    * In addition, 45% of looked after children was reported to have a mental health disorder compared with around 10% of the general population (DfES, 2007).
    * These issues appear to be related to placement instability (Scott, 2011), with disrupted attachment thought to contribute to many of the commonly recognised risky behaviours looked-after children display (e.g. drug and alcohol misuse, crime involvement, Broad & Monaghan, 2003).
    * Not surprisingly, Sempik, Ward, and Darker (2008, p. 122) noted that young people who become looked-after are already among ‘the most vulnerable and disadvantaged members of society
    * Prior to their entry into care, they tend to live on low income and in lone parent households in deprived neighbourhoods and may have been exposed to violence, poverty and parental substance abuse (McAuley & Davis, 2009; Scott, 2011)
    * It is thought that enabling looked-after children to engage in sport and physical activity ‘equal to their peers’ may provide fruitful opportunities to enhance their physical and psychological well-being (DfES, 2007, p. 10)
    * This belief that sport and physical activity can aid young people’s social and moral development through its inherent ‘character building’ capacities has led to their use as tools for re-engaging disaffected youth (Sandford & Duncombe, 2011)
    * A growing body of international research suggests that sport can help strengthen relationships and promote ‘active citizenship’, build resilience and address social problems of disadvantage and exclusion through the generation of social capital (Bailey, 2005)
    * alleviate looked-after children’s earlier disadvantages and provide secure, stable, affectionate relationships in one sphere of life (Department for Children, Schools and Families, 2009)
    * To gauge a more nuanced picture of looked-after children (that incorporates the interconnections between the care setting, other socio-cultural factors and pays attention to individual agency), Winter (2006) called for the wider use of sociological understandings in research and policy
    * highlighting the voices of four looked-after children from one residential children’s home and their experiences of sport and physical activity. Specifically, it asks the following: (1) What are the sport and physical activity experiences of looked-after children? (2) What meanings and values do looked-after children ascribe to their engagement in sport and physical activity?

* # Methodology
    * As such, the wider study drew from the mosaic approach and sought to engage with looked-after children through a variety of participatory research methods
    * The mosaic approach acknowledges young people and adults as co-constructors of meaning through a combination of the visual and the verbal (Clark & Moss, 2001)
    * a participatory, multi-method approach whereby young people’s own research artefacts (photographs, maps, drawings, etc.,) are joined to talk and observations to gain a deeper understanding of their perspectives and everyday lives (Clark & Moss, 2001)
    * It involves participants gathering documentation and generating research artefacts (each providing a piece of the mosaic) before piecing together such information for dialogue, reflection and interpretation (Clark & Moss, 2001)
    * capture the voices of looked-after children, this research recognised the benefits of using participatory methods to provide pieces of the mosaic, give voice to vulnerable, ‘hidden’ young people and highlight the issues/challenges they faced
    * Since looked-after children were not involved in designing the research, ‘participatory techniques provide participants with control over the agenda and how information is provided’ (Kendrick, Steckley, & Lerpiniere, 2008, p. 82)
    * informal nature also encourages participation and reduces anxiety for young people who are anxious about their reading or communication skills (Clark & Statham, 2005)
    * a combination of traditional ‘adult’ methods and child-centred methods should be used with young people so that they are not patronised by using only child-friendly techniques (Clark & Statham, 2005; Punch, 2002)
    * Access and ethical considerations
        * Hood, Kelley, and Mayall (1996, p. 120) refer to this as ‘a hierarchy of gatekeeping’ running from the organisational level to the ‘parents’ (or in this case, corporate parents4) and finally the child
        * As Kendrick et al. (2008, p. 88) suggest, ‘there is the possibility that they [looked-after children] have been placed there because of abuse by their parents, or because there has been a breakdown in relationships in the family’
        * It may, therefore, not be appropriate nor in the best interests of the child to approach their parent(s) for consent (Kendrick et al., 2008)
    
    * # Methods: listening to looked-after children
        * For instance, timelines were chosen by the boys to express their engagement with sport and physical activity
        * This is a popular communication tool used by social workers and provides simple ways to interpret the influence that different contexts and time have on an individual’s current life (e.g. in this context, the impact different life transitions/placements have on their engagement with sport and physical activity) (Deacon, 2006; Thomas &O’Kane, 1998)
        * Critical incidents were defined as incidents they saw as having an important consequence for their relationship with sport and physical activity (Enright & O’Sullivan, 2012). Drawings and written text were then used to identify these incidents on their timelines (e.g. Figure 1 and Figure 2)
        * Rating scales, if designed correctly, have the potential to offer useful insights into young people’s preferences (Airey, Plowman, Connolly, & Luckin, 2002)
        * Peer interviewing is a process that involves individuals conducting interviews with a member of their peer group
        * To date, there is limited literature on the use of this technique with young people of this age; somewhat surprising since the benefits of involving young people in research include them being able to help put peers at ease in interviews and make the setting less formal (Kirby, 2004)
        * However, peer interviews have been used previously with young people aged 18 and over from care backgrounds (Munro, Lushey, Ward, & National Care Advisory Service, 2011)
        * Ultimately, involving young people through peer interviews can help redress power imbalances between researchers and the researched and maximise opportunities to hear young people’s views and explore their experiences (Kilpatrick, McCartan, McAlister, & McKeown, 2007; Kirby, 2004)
        * They then engaged in a mock interview/role-play activity with feedback and questions
        * Following this, the interview questions were developed in collaboration with the participants, meaning the language and terminology employed was accessible to all of the boys, with topics that reflected the issues that the peer researchers perceived to be critical within the overall frame of research
        * semi-structured interview protocol concerning the artefacts

    # Analysis
    - Peer interview texts, research artefact discussions, observations and field notes were thematically analysed (Braun & Clarke, 2006)
        * social theory of Bourdieu: Bourdieu’s(1984) work can be applied to explore not only just the lived experiences of individuals but also the social conditions that shape and limit that experience
        * The themes and patterns within the data were identified in both an inductive (‘bottom up’) and a deductive (theoretical or ‘top down’) way (Braun & Clarke, 2006)
        * The former ensured that themes identified were strongly linked to the data themselves (similar to the grounded theory) without trying to fit them into a preexisting coding frame
        * Despite this, it is important to note that researchers cannot free themselves of their theoretical and epistemological commitments (Braun & Clarke, 2006) and, as such, deductive analysis was also employed as this allowed for a more detailed analysis of some aspects of the data (Braun & Clarke, 2006)
* # Findings
    * The first theme (disrupted patterns of engagement) deals with the critical incidents that have impacted their lives and shaped their engagement with sport and physical activity
    * The second theme (institutional constraints) is concerned with the structural conditions of their lives that further shape engagement whilst living in care
    * The final theme (sport as a means to an end) explores the reasons behind their engagement and the values they ascribe to sport and physical activity
    * Disrupted Patterns of Engagement
        * Changes in placements and consequently schools mean that for the majority of looked-after children, school attendance is problematic (Murray, 2012)
        * Looked-after children often miss out on school-based sporting activities and are more dependent on out-of-school activities than other children
        * It is argued that prolonged participation in sports activities may be an important source of stability and consistency for those living in or leaving care, as it helps reestablish some sense of structure to their lives (Farineau & McWey, 2011)
        * However, even continued participation in sporting activities appears problematic due to substantial, continual changes in care placements
        * Fong, Schwab, and Armour (2006) proposed that if placement continuity is not possible for certain looked-after children, then continuity of activities would allow that young person to maintain regular, familiar and/or ‘normalising’ activities, which might minimise the disruptive effect of placement in care
        * During their discussions of their timelines both reported that moving home was a reason for disengaging from sport and physical activity
        * impact that placement moves have had on his engagement with sport, though unlike the others, he has been fortunate enough to pick up those activities again
        * Bourdieu (1984) referred to social space as ‘fields’, which he defined as sites where beliefs and values are established and imposed on the people within them through the various relationships and practices that occur
        * the children’s home, a particular social space where they live and interact with others in a hierarchical relationship, can be viewed as a field. This ‘field’ can nurture sport and physical activity preferences, interests and tastes (the conscious expression of habitus) (Bourdieu, 1984)
        * However, for these young people, this immediate field (the children’s home and the individuals within it) is often in a state of flux, shifting with each placement move as they are introduced to new agents (new staff and other looked-after children)
        * As well as changes in this field, placement moves often result in changes in school (another field), meaning their position within these new fields (where sport and physical activity could be accessed) had to be renegotiated each time
    * # Institutional constraints
        * Bourdieu’s(1984) concepts place an emphasis on the relationship between structure and agency and were employed to provide a means of analysing the workings of the social world
        * Agency, on the other hand, refers to an individual’s ability to make free choices, to control how they shape their lives and manifests (in this context) in the type of sport and physical activity choices adopted. Here, it was evident that agency for these looked-after children was a constant struggle with the broader structures of the field that shaped their lives
        * While a lack of time was previously reported to be a key factor restricting leisure activities (including sports and physical activities) (Hollingworth, 2012), like these initial findings, this may result from structural and organisational policies (Gay, Dowda, Saunders, & Evans, 2011). For instance, having to eat evening meals at set times and needing to negotiate time for activities with staff
        * Macdonald et al. (2004) suggested that young people’s physical activity is frequently a task to be managed in relation to the competing demands of other members of the field (in their case, the family)
        * However, this takes on a whole new meaning for looked-after children whose relationships with those in the field (children’s home) are less well defined. According to Bourdieu (1993), individuals exercise agency within existing social conventions, and this was apparent here and in previous studies
        * For instance, Gay et al. (2011) found that some residential home policies may include rules that affect access to sport and physical activity opportunities (e.g. the provision of transportation to activities and scheduled activity time)
    * # Sport as a means to an end
        * Perhaps the biggest ‘selling point’ for sport and physical activity is that such activities may offer marginalised young people, such as looked-after children, an opportunity to reintegrate into mainstream society and develop social networks
        * Hollingworth (2012) found that sport for those living in, or leaving care, enabled them to develop friendships and widen their social network, as well as mix and socialise in mainstream activities with young people who are not in care
        * Sport can, therefore, help facilitate social integration through the generation of social capital
        * Social capital refers to an individual’s stock of ‘social connections’ (Bourdieu, 1986, p. 47), that is, the relational networks that allow individuals to maximise their ability to convert capital into different forms
        * Developing social networks is key for looked-after children who often ‘experience a sense of being set apart from their community’ (Murray, 2012, p. 3).
        *  These placement moves and subsequent changes in field particularly impact on these individuals possession of the necessary social (access to friends) and cultural capital (taste for particular sport and activities) that would afford them the agency to participate in sporting activities
* # Conclusion
    * The purpose of this paper was to provide an insight into a new area of research in the area of sport and physical activity
    * Though based on only a few voices, these initial findings indicate that while the barriers they face may be similar to other lowincome children, due to placement instability, they also experience disrupted sport/ physical activity experiences that may alienate them further
    * For Bourdieu, day-to-day activities are produced by an interaction of social structure and agency; an individual’s capacity to act and make free choices. However, Hunter (2004, p. 176) has argued that ‘acting as an agent may be mediated by influences that are beyond their conscious realisation’
    * Despite this, developing social networks (capital) was one important reason for engaging in activity. It is important to remember, though, that due to the disrupted patterns of engagement, sport may not necessarily form a central or formative part of their lives at this particular point in time
    * It should also be remembered that looked-after children are not a homogenous group (Armour, Sandford, & Duncombe, 2011), and therefore, it is important not to stereotype young people in care as having certain undisputable characteristics or tendencies
    * Not wanting to homogenise looked-after children, future research should explore difference with regard to gender, age, ethnicity and SEN of these young people, since those involved here were all white males
    * a strengths-based approach should also be considered when exploring further research in this area
    * Finally, consideration should also be given to the voices of young people who are cared for in foster homes/families as well as those in institutional homes as they may experience different challenges altogether
