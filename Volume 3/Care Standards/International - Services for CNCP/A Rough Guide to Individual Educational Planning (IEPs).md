# Brief:

* Scope & Description: This article is based on the experiences of the author while developing and implementing individual education plans for children with special educational needs in mainstream and special school settings.The focus here is on children with special educational needs, who may have their needs met by attending a special school, a special class, or through mainstream placement, perhaps with the support of a special education or resource teacher. With the advent of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, 2004, schools will find that they increasingly need to become familiar with educational planning and it is hoped that the guidance here will contribute to increased confidence and competence

# Understanding Individual Educational Plan (IEP):

* IEP is very much about a process, where a written document is the product of that process.
* Developing an IEP is about the collaboration of concerned people in planning for a student’s special educational needs and about how that plan can be brought to life in a meaningful and useful way.
* ## Key Characteristics of an IEP:
    * Special
        * An individual education plan can be the medium by which we put the special into special education. 
        * It is, by necessity, about going beyond what is normally available in the curriculum, and specifies what is particular and special about the provision that is being offered to an individual student, irrespective of the place where that provision is delivered.
    * Individualised
        * Each individual education plan is tailor made for a particular student. 
        * IEPs produced for children with special needs should not look the same, and those produced for children attending the same class should not have identical targets. 
        * The individualised nature of the planning depends on in-depth knowledge of a child’s strengths, needs and aspirations. 
    * Has a shelf life of one year (max)
        * An individual educational plan should not cover more than one academic year, because to extend further than that would lead us into distant speculation and vagueness. 
        * The IEP is a more immediate plan that specifies the learning and teaching that will happen in a relatively short time frame. 
        * IEPs can be written for a term or even a week, but the time frames must be realistic. 
        * Often a written IEP covers a full academic year and, at the same time, more detailed targets are developed for weekly or termly instruction. 
    * Targets and goals are specified
        * The individual educational plan specifies the targets and goals that a student will achieve within a given time frame. 
        * It should be noted that the term educational is used in its broadest sense and goals can include social targets, self-help skills, attendance goals as well as targets for academic learning and cognitive development. 
    * Specifies teaching methods and supporting strategies
        * The individual education plan also specifies how these targets and goals will be taught in terms of the methods and resources that will be used to support the learning.
    * Regularly reviewed
        * An IEP needs to be monitored and reviewed, not least to gauge whether or not it is being effective. 
        * Systems for doing this can vary widely and there is no doubt that a key adult needs to take responsibility for coordinating information to ensure that reviewing is effective. 
        * In my experience, in the mainstream context this is an important role for the specialist teacher. 
    * Shared with the students
        * A really effective IEP is one that the student understands and to which he or she is committed. 
        * Depending on the student’s level of skill, he or she can be engaged in the process from the very beginning, from planning through to self monitoring and review
    * Parents participate
        * Parents play a crucial role in helping to develop meaningful goals and in implementing aspects of the agreed plan. Their involvement and commitment is essential to the process. 
    * Be a working document
        * Most of all a meaningful individual educational plan is a working document, which can be modified in light of experience and must be responsive to changing situations. 
        * It is always discouraging to hear any of these key participants say that an IEP exists, but they are not sure what it says or where it is. 
        * This suggests that the IEP exists in paper only and is without meaning or value. It should be a guide to which students, teachers and parents refer on an on-going basis.
* ## Need for an IEP:
    * An IEP makes best use of assessments
        * Most children now attending special educational provision have been assessed by a psychologist. 
        * A comprehensive psychological report should include information about the child’s learning strengths and difficulties and suggestions for supporting the child in his or her learning
    * It is an opportunity to share information
        * Everyone concerned with the child can share information in a planning meeting. This develops a collaborative approach and encourages participation and commitment
    * It establishes priorities:
        * Sometimes when we work with a child with special educational needs, those needs can appear quite overwhelming
        * In these cases it can seem hard to know where to start. However, in the context of a planning meeting, the participants can discuss the issues and agree priorities. 
        * This can help teachers and parents to feel less burdened, because there is some plan of action and a sense of purpose
    * It clarifies expectations
        * The process of developing an IEP helps all parties to be clear about what to expect in the coming year
        * The IEP process allows all parties to discuss the priorities and goals and usually goes a long way to dispel anxieties about progress.
    * It engages parents
        * The IEP process can offer an opportunity to talk about a child’s gifts and strengths, their hopes and plans and what will be done to help them. 
        * It can be a positive experience, not least because it is highly practical and has a problem solving focus. 
        * Parents who are otherwise reluctant to attend school based meetings, may be more willing to attend meetings to develop individual plans, because there is a sense that their unique child is individually valued and that such a meeting is purposeful
    * It motivates students
        * The individual education plan gives them specific goals that are realistic and attainable and allows the students to have a sense of purpose.
    * It documents success
        * The individual education plan allows all parties (parents, teachers and students) to look back on their work and document the progress made and the record successes.
    * It facilitates review
        * The IEP allows for more thorough reviews, not just of what the child has learnt, but also of what teaching methods were found useful. 
        * One special school principal who has used an IEP system across the whole school noted that the quality of school reports improved significantly once the system was established.
    * It provides on-going information
        * As the process of IEPs becomes established in a school, the IEP itself becomes a tool for planning and reviewing. 
        * The previous IEP can, and should, be used to plan the next IEP and there is an invaluable record of priorities, plans, targets achieved and not achieved and resources deployed.


# The making of an IEP

* Getting started
    * In schools where there is little or no experience of devising IEPs, the tasks of gathering information, organising planning meetings, recording targets and reviewing can seem very daunting. 
    * Inevitably, like any new process, the first few attempts will be experienced as unfamiliar and there will be elements of resistance, confusion and difficulty. 
    * It should also be remembered that the process will be far more time-consuming at first and with experience the various elements will not seem so cumbersome and demanding.
* Training 
    * The next step is to organise adequate training for staff. This could be organised through your local teacher’s centre, or perhaps through a professional body such as IATSE/ ILSA.
* Gathering Information
    * A key task in developing an IEP is to gather information from relevant sources. It is important that one adult has overall responsibility for the IEP. 
    * This is particularly important in situations where a child has contact with many people in the course of his or her school day. 
    * Some information can be gathered before a planning meeting takes place, and particular care needs to be taken to ensure the meaningful collaboration of parents and children
* The planning meeting
    * This is the most crucial component of the process. The IEP planning meeting, with time, may also become the forum in which an IEP is reviewed 
    * In essence, the people who need to attend this meeting are those involved directly in the child’s educational provision. 
        * Let’s start with the professional staff. In a mainstream setting this should include the mainstream class teacher, the special education teacher and ideally the school principal. 
        * Other concerned professionals such as the educational psychologist or speech and language therapist may be invited as appropriate
    * One person needs to chair the meeting, and ideally, another can make some written notes. With experience it is possible to have a completed IEP written and ready for distribution at the end of the meeting
    * A typical agenda could include: 
        * Introducing participants 
        * Identifying child’s strengths and gifts 
        * Identifying child’s needs and difficulties 
        * Suggested priorities 
        * Suggested targets in key areas, with suggested strategies
        * Agreed actions 
        * Review date set
    * An IEP should meet the requirements set out in section 9 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act. This specifies the content of the IEP as follows: 
        * The nature and degree of the child’s abilities, skills and talents 
        * The nature and degree of the child’s special educational needs and how these needs affect his/ her progress 
        * The present level of educational performance of the child 
        * The special educational needs of the child 
        * The special education and related support services to be provided to the child 
        * The goals which the child is to achieve over a period not exceeding 12 months
* Agreed Actions
    * During the planning meeting, it is very important that all participants are aware of who is going to implement which aspects of the IEP. 
    * For example, a target that a child improves attendance so that she /he attends every day, might involve parents who commit to waking the child, a child who commits to not wasting time in the shops, a teacher who undertakes to monitor attendance, plus an agreed reward for a week’s perfect attendance.
* Writing targets
    * Under the terms of the Act, long term goals, targets and strategies would all be part of the section ‘goals which the child is to achieve over a period not exceeding 12 months.’ 
    * The first task is to identify the child’s strengths and difficulties (the nature and degree of the child’s abilities, skills and talents and the nature and degree of the child’s special educational needs and how those affect his/ her progress). 
    * It is most important that information is recorded in precise behavioural terms. The greater the level of detail at this stage, the more likely that targets will be accurate and relevant
    * It is at this preparation stage that objective data is most useful, because it allows us to set realistic targets, it gives a clear baseline from which to work and it establishes clarity about the current level of functioning
    * Ideally teachers should prepare a written account of the child’s level of skill in key areas (the present level of educational performance of the child). 
    * On the basis of the above information it should be possible to agree a summary statement about the child’s special educational needs, (the special educational needs of the child). 
    * The next step is to talk about priorities and long term goals. It is very useful for a teacher to ask her/himself, ‘What do I want this child to be doing at the end of this year that she/ he cannot do now?’. 
    * To foster positive thinking, it can be helpful to say, ‘It would be great if…’. This question should be explicitly aired at the planning meeting to have as much consensus as possible. The answer to such a question usually gives the whole IEP endeavour a focus.
    * The next step is to compose some targets. These should relate very directly to the needs identified in the first section and should also build on the gifts and strengths identified. Again, precise terms are essential if the targets are to be meaningful. 
    * Some practitioners refer to SMART targets (specific, measurable, agreed, realistic, timed). It is not necessary to become torturously convoluted and pedantic, but it is essential that the targets are written in such a way that they can be effectively evaluated.
* Specifying strategies
    * This is a vital step in articulating what is special about the special education that the student is offered. Where relevant, teachers should state the ways in which targets are to be delivered
* Parental Involvement
    * In some situations it may be better if the parents' views are sought before the planning meeting, either by informal meeting, questionnaire or by telephone interview. 
    * These mechanisms need not be overly time-consuming and allow professionals to be aware of parental issues in advance of the meeting. 
    * This also allows parents to have a structured framework to work through in advance of the meeting and may help them to clarify their own thoughts and have some sense of what to expect. 
    * In some cases the parents need not attend the planning meeting, but their contribution may be recorded, shared at the meeting, and the IEP can be drafted by the multidisciplinary team and then shared with the parent subsequently in a more informal meeting.
    * Parents do often ask, ‘What can I do to help my child?’ and teachers should give this question some prior consideration. 
    * Parents may volunteer to undertake a task, such as listening to a child read every evening. 
    * Parents may also be involved in monitoring behaviour. Most importantly, parents can be engaged in the giving of rewards.
* Student Participation
    * In these cases a familiar and sympathetic adult should spend some time with the student in advance of the meeting, eliciting his/her views. 
    * Schools can develop a very simple proforma prompt sheet with relevant questions and issues. 
    * If the student will not be attending the meeting, his/ her views should be shared with the group. 
    * Some schools have found it useful to ask the student to join the meeting towards the end of the process
* Monitoring
    * An IEP needs some amount of on-going monitoring. A key member of staff needs to have an overview of the targets and of the child’s progress. 
    * Certainly, staff should not be doggedly implementing a strategy that does not work, just because it is specified in the original IEP.
* Reviewing
    * The Education Act 2004 specifies various requirements in terms of reviewing education plans in section 11. The guidance here is broadly compatible with those requirements. 
    * Reviews should actively involve the child and parents, as well as teachers and support staff. There are a range of different ways of organising reviews. It is usually best if any system developed fits in as far as possible with existing school structures
    * There should be some written documentation, even if it is a scribbled, dated note on the original IEP which notes which targets have been achieved. This will be invaluable information for the following year when the IEP for the next academic year is being prepared. 
    * In a formal review meeting key questions which need to be asked are: 
        * What progress has the child made? 
        * Which targets have been achieved?  
        * How successful were the strategies used? 
        * What are the next steps? 
        * Should alternative strategies be tried? 
        * Is a more detailed assessment needed? 
        * Is everyone clear about what has been agreed? 
        * Who will do what, by when?


# Recommendations for an IEP:
* Beware of paperwork:
    * The author advises to beware of cumbersome systems, which involve a lot of paperwork. These usually collapse or else are sustained through teacher exhaustion but are neither helpful to teachers, nor useful to children. 
* High standard quality of dialogue:
    * It is far more important that the quality of dialogue during a review meeting is of the highest standard, then that the written document is pristine. Some solutions; drafted targets can be written on slips of paper and, if agreed, can be pasted onto a blank document. 
* Do not reinvent the wheel. 
    * Proformas for the IEP planning sheet and the IEP document itself can be gleaned from relevant sources. With time, most schools will probably develop their own system, with tailor made paperwork, but proformas are certainly a way to get started (two are included at the end of this article). 
* Start with small number of children:
    * Introducing IEPs at first can be daunting, but getting started, even with a small number of students, is the key. It is hoped that this article is helpful in giving some encouragement and practical guidance.
