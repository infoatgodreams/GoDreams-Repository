# Brief

## Scope & Description: 
- This study reports the effects of a structural intervention, ENRICH (Environmental Interventions in Children’s Homes) which targeted the physical and social environment within residential children’s homes (RCHs) to increase physical activity (PA) among residents (N=799). Participating RCHs (N=29) were randomized to Early (n=17) or Delayed (n=12) groups. Children’s PA was measured at three time periods (2004, 2006, 2008). Intent-to-treat analysis revealed no intervention impact on PA. Subsequent analyses used process evaluation data to group organizations into high and low PA-promoting RCHs to compare PA level, controlling for assignment to condition. Organizations with high PA-promoting environments were found to have more active youth. To date, this is the first study to report on youth physical activity outcomes and implementation from a structural intervention targeting RCHs in North and South Carolina.

## Structural Ecologic Model (SEM)  

Identifies four structural factors of environmental influences which have the capacity to impact population-level health outcomes 
- availability of products and services
- characteristics of available opportunities
- social structures and policies 
- media/cultural messages


## Hypothesis

It was hypothesized that a greater percentage of children in the early-intervention group would report 2+ blocks of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and Total MET-weighted blocks at post-test (2006), compared to those in the delayed-intervention group (i.e., control-group). Furthermore, it was hypothesized that intervention effects would be greater in RCHs with documented higher levels of intervention implementation  


## Method
- From the 54 RCHs willing to participate from North and South Carolina, 29 were    eligible to participate based on the criteria of having a relatively stable population of children requiring low-to-moderate management with no restrictions on PA.
- Eligible RCHs were matched on organizational characteristics and randomly assigned to Early (treatment) or Delayed (control) intervention groups; using a randomized crossover design, the Early and Delayed groups received the intervention from 2004-2006 and 2006-2008, respectively.
- Individual participants were 799 children residing in 24 of the 29 RCHs that had at least 10 children in residence at the time of measurement. Children were recruited if they were 11 to 18 years of age and could complete questionnaires with minimal assistance.
- Descriptive variables included age (Mean ± SD); years in current RCH residence (Mean ± SD); gender (male/female); race (White/Black/Other); weight (normal/overweight/obese); and body mass index (BMI) score (Mean ± SD).


## ENRICH Intervention

- The ENRICH intervention entailed developing working relationships with RCH staff to achieve the mutually agreed-upon goal of enhancing RCH social and physical environments to promote PA for children residing in the homes.
- Adult staff formed small working groups, Wellness Teams (WT) which served as organizational change agents by developing and carrying out plans to create RCH environments that supported PA.
- The WTs implemented a variety of strategies based on their assessments. Most promoted on and offsite PA opportunities through flyers and announcements, and provided training to staff members on the importance of encouraging the children to be active and participating in activities with the children.
- Some WTs implemented “girls only” workout sessions or added activities selected by the children. Others modified schedules to preclude other activities (e.g. homework) during time scheduled for PA.


## Measures  


### 3-Day Physical Activity Recall (3-DPAR)

- Children’s PA was assessed using the 3- DPAR which includes self-reported physical and sedentary activities
-    The 3-DPAR was administered on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday to capture weekday and weekend activities. 
- Physical and sedentary activities were grouped into the following   categories: eating, work, after school/spare-time/hobbies, transportation, sleep/bathing, school, physical activities and sports.
- Self-reported activities corresponded to metabolic equivalent (MET) values based on the Compendium of Physical Activities.
- Data were summarized by adding the number of 30-minute blocks for which the reported activity was rated at an intensity of three or more METs consistent with the 2008 PA guidelines for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA).


### Description of Environmental Measures

Environmental characteristics of participating RCHs were assessed annually with two surveys specifically developed for this study:
- the Physical Activity and Dietary Environmental Assessment questionnaire **(PADEA)**
- the Organizational Assessment Survey **(OA)**


#### PADEA

- PADEA is a 69-item paper-and pencil questionnaire based on the Structural Ecologic Model and assesses the physical activity and food environments of RCHs.
- Response options ranged from 0-3 with 0 indicating “does not exist” or “Never” and 3 indicating “Fully in place” or “Always”. A physical activity environment score was determined for each index by summing and averaging response to items in the index. 
-  Higher index scores indicate the RCH environment is more conducive to physical activity


#### OA
- The OA Survey included 30 items which assessed whether or not PA programs were provided, presence of an on-site school, presence of a recreation director, number of sites, populations served, and types of services provided.
- Organizations that had multiple locations, served multiple populations, and/or provided multiple types of care were classifies as “complex”; the remaining homes were classified as “simple”


### ENRICH Implementation Monitoring and Results

- ENRICH used a comprehensive approach to assess “fidelity and completeness” of implementation, reflected by the activities of the Wellness Team
- Data from five sources, including the WT contact (the implementer), environmental observations, and ratings from measurement and intervention staff, were triangulated to assess PA implementation. Between 2004-2006, 9 RCHs in the Early and 4 in the Delayed groups met the criteria for physical activity implementation; 4 RCHs in the Early and 4 in the Delayed groups met the criteria for physical activity implementation in 2006-2008; and 5 RCHs of 29 (3 in Early and 2 in Delayed) met the criteria for PA implementation from 2004-2008
- Global implementation using five data sources to assess perceptions of overall (versus PA-specific) implementation was done. From 2004-2006, 9 RCHs assigned to the Early group met the criteria for global implementation (not assessed in delayed); from 2006-2008, 10 Early and 5 Delayed RCHs met the criteria); and between 2004 and 2008, 12 of 29 organizations (7 in Early and 5 in Delayed) met the criteria for global implementation.


## Results  


### Participant Characteristics
- A total of 799 youth between 11-18 years of age were included in Delayed or Early intervention groups. Across the three measurement waves, approximately half of the children were male. Distributions for race remained relatively constant with a greater percentage of White children compared to Black/Other.
- BMI scores indicate participants overall, were within normal weight range (24.0-25.2). Weight status, stratified by condition across measurement years, suggest prevalence of overweight and obesity in Early and Delayed groups was approximately 40% in 2004 and 2006, and 44% in 2008. 
- Mean age ranged between 14.5 and 15.6 years across the three measurement waves for both Early and Delayed groups.


### Intervention Effects based on Assignment to Condition

There were no intervention effects on total METs or 2+ blocks of MVPA (Model 1) in the intent-to-treat analysis. Adjusting for level of physical activity implementation (Model 2) and global implementation (Model 3) did not change the results. 


### Physical Activity Outcomes based on Grouping by Level of Implementation 

- Children in “high” (N=273 children in 5 RCHs) compared to “low” (N=562 children in 19 RCHs) implementing organizations reported significantly more MET-weighted blocks and a higher percent of > 2 blocks of MVPA in Year 2 (2006) only.
- When organizations were grouped by global implementation, children in “high” (N=366 children in 10 RCHs) compared to “low” (N=433 children in 14 RCHs) implementing organizations reported significantly more MET-weighted blocks and a higher percent of > 2 blocks of MVPA in Years 1 (2004) and 2 (2006) but not in year 3 (2008). Controlling for assignment to condition did not affect these results


### Results of Baseline Characteristics of Higher PA and Global 4-Year Implementers 

- Baseline characteristics of “high” versus “low” PA-promoting environments are described in Table 4 and suggest that RCHs with high PA-promoting environments can be characterized by urban versus rural settings (62% versus 25% in “high” versus “low”) and as having recreation directors (75% versus 25% in “high” versus “low”); they also had higher PADEA scores (>.5) for availability of PA opportunities, favorable characteristics of PA opportunities, PA policy, Wellness for adult staff, and collaboration with community on PA.


## Discussion

- The ENRICH intervention had no impact on physical activity of youth residing within RCHs, even after the level of intervention implementation was considered.
- An extensive process evaluation documented varied implementation among RCHs assigned to the intervention as well as “implementation” of physical activity-promoting practices among RCHs assigned to the Delayed condition.
- To explore this further we grouped organizations by “high” and “low” physical activity-promoting environments and found that some organizations were promoting physical activity, with more active residents at baseline. These organizations can be characterized as having more PA opportunities, more supportive PA policies and practices at baseline, and having dedicated recreation staff.  
- Experts recommend multi-level interventions for changes within the physical and social environments where children are typically situated and through which health behaviors can be influenced.
- ENRICH was a structural intervention that worked with adult staff as change agents to create a more health-promoting environment in the RCH, which was hypothesized to result in increased PA among children. Based on theory and expert recommendation, we anticipated that working with organizational change agents to create PA-promoting environments that could be adapted to setting and population needs would increase PA among the children residing there, but this was not the case.
- It is possible that delivery of the intervention was not sufficient for producing individual behavior change for this population, especially since implementation varied greatly between homes. However, implementation was documented by a comprehensive process evaluation and subsequently controlled for in the analysis and did not change the results. 
- Lastly, these results could be a reflection of the transient nature of the population who were exposed to the RCH environments for varying periods of time. We adjusted for length of residence in analyses which did not affect results. It seems likely, then, that the intervention was wholly ineffective or, more likely, that different intervention approaches may be more effective for organizations in “high” versus “low” PA-promoting environments at baseline. This approach would require conducting an organizational “readiness” or “capacity” assessment at baseline to inform intervention development.
- At baseline, 62% of foster youth in Early and 68% in Delayed groups reported engaging in MVPA which remained relatively stable across subsequent measurement years. This is much higher than national prevalence estimates of 42% and 50% for children of similar age, race, and gender.
- Examining outcome data with baseline PADEA and OA data creates a more complete, contextually-based understanding of study outcomes. Given that foster youth are predisposed for many physical, mental, and social health problems, health promotion efforts designed to impact current and life-long health behaviors is needed, especially longitudinal research.


## Lessons Learned

- Within the group home setting, it is clear that implementation does not occur in an ordered and uniform process and is influenced by many contextual factors within organizational environments.
- The ENRICH intervention had no measurable effect on MVPA at the individual level; however, we found that some organizations were promoting PA based on our framework at baseline and that these RCHs had more children reporting MVPA. 
- Interventions targeting organizational changes to impact population health behaviors should devote careful attention and provide adequate resources to effectively monitor and document implementation. Moreover, contextual factors within organizational settings including the PA environment and organizational capacity to implement health promotion programs are important to consider and should be assessed prior to implementation.
- Future work is needed to examine the different organizational climates and cultures which influence the implementation of health promotion programs and changes to the physical and social PA environment.
