# Brief:

* Scope & Description: A systematic review was conducted of randomized controlled trials (RCT) evaluating interventions aimed at LACYP (Looked-after children and young people) aged ≤18 years. Fifteen studies reporting on 12 interventions met the inclusion criteria. Nine interventions demonstrated tentative impacts. Evaluations were conducted in a limited range of countries, with all but two being undertaken in North America.

# Summary: 


## Reasons why LACYP has poorer educational outcomes

Higher education is impacted, with those in foster care being half as likely to have a university degree or equivalent by age 26. A range of negative-life course events likely influenced by educational disadvantage is also more prevalent in individuals who have been in care, including unemployment, homelessness, and receipt of social welfare. 

* limited and variable access to the educational system
* home and school placement instability
* weak family and social networks
* insufficient accountability or monitoring of academic outcomes by the care system
* There are a range of non-random factors, including maltreatment, socioeconomic deprivation, race, and ethnicity that predict entry into care but may also independently explain educational disadvantage.


## Issues with existing interventions for LACYP in the care of the state

Despite emerging evidence to suggest the relative educational deficits experienced by LACYP, there remains a dearth of effective interventions directly targeted at this population or addressing them as a key subgroup within universal approaches. 

* There remains an insufficiency of theoretically-driven interventions, and where theoretical approaches have gained traction, as with the Early Start to Emancipation Preparation (ESTEP) Tutoring program, interventions have been ineffective. 
* reported intervention impacts tend to be the product of discrete and isolated incidents of evaluation, with limited examples of replication (The only exception is Teach Your Children Well, which has been evaluated as both an individualized and group-based approach).
* existing evidence of effect is compromised by a lack of scientific rigor, with limited utilization of RCTs, which arguably constitute the most appropriate methodology to answer questions of effectiveness.


## Methodology of the study:

* Studies were identified from 1989, to coincide with the inception of the Children’s Act in the UK (1989), which allocates statutory obligations to ensure the safeguarding of children. 
* Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified for inclusion.
*  Study participants comprised children and young people aged 18 years or younger who were currently looked after or had previous care experience.
* Studies were required to report on a range of educational outcomes: academic skills; academic achievement and grade completion; special education status; homework completion; school attendance, suspension, and drop-out; the number of school placements; teacher-student relationships; school behavior; and academic attitudes.


#### Information sources:

* Twelve relevant electronic bibliographic databases were searched from December 2014 through March 2015. Searches were limited to the English language.


#### Study selection:
* Retrieved studies were exported into Endnote and duplicates were removed.
*  Two review authors independently screened study titles and abstracts against the inclusion criteria. A third reviewer adjudicated discrepancies in decisions. 
* Two review authors independently screened the full text of the studies. Disagreement was resolved through discussion.


#### Data extraction:

* The Cochrane data extraction and appraisal form were adapted to generate standardized Pro-forma for extraction. 
* Two reviewers extracted data. 
* Abstracted items included: intervention group demographics; control group demographics; intervention setting and design; study design; outcome measurements; methods of analysis; process evaluation data; economic evaluation data; intervention effects.
* Searching electronic bibliographic databases retrieved 2,514 studies. After further consultation, numerous studies fell short of the inclusion criteria and were removed. Finally, 15 studies, reporting on 12 educational interventions, were included in the review


## Description of interventions:


##### Kids in Transition to School

- The intervention was delivered within the school setting
- This is a classroom-based program delivered 2 months prior to kindergarten entry and during the first 2 months of school.
- Children attend 24 sessions that address early literacy skills, prosocial skills, and self-regulatory activities. 
- Sessions comprise 12–15 children and are delivered for a period of 2 hours, twice weekly in the first phase, and once weekly in the second phase. 
- Carers attend eight parallel meetings intended to develop their capacity to support the child in practicing new skills, routines, and behavior. 
- Child sessions are delivered by a graduate-level teacher and two assistant teachers, and the carer group is delivered by a facilitator and assistant, with all completing a standardized 40-hour training program. 
- Participants also receive supplemental materials to support the implementation of new skills.


##### Early Start to Emancipation Preparation (ESTEP) programme 

- The intervention was delivered in the care setting, where undergraduate and graduate students are the delivery agents.
- Young people meet with a tutor twice a week within the care setting and receive up to 50 hours of tutoring in a math, spelling, reading, and vocabulary curriculum.
- Tutors receive one day of training on commencement of the intervention and ongoing development twice a year.
- A mentoring relationship is also anticipated, with youth acquiring the skills and experience to develop healthy relationships. 


##### Teach Your Children Well (TYCW) approach

- The interventions were delivered by carers within the care setting.
- The individual-level Teach Your Children Well focuses on direct one-to-one instruction by trained foster carers.
- Intervention includes 3 hours of instruction per week, comprising 2 hours one-to-one instruction in reading, 30 minutes reading aloud by the foster child, and 30 minutes self-paced instruction in maths. The small-group-based Teach Your Children Well involves one or two trained university students delivering the curriculum to 3–4 children.
- The duration is 25 weeks-30 weeks


##### Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care for Adolescents (MTFC-A) 

- Delivers training and supervision to specialist foster parents for a nine-month period, with a short period of aftercare.
- There is also the Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care (MTFC) intervention which caters to young girls leaving the juvenile system. The intervention involves moving into a specialist foster placement for an average duration of 174 days.


##### The Letterbox Club 

- This intervention was delivered in the care setting, but there was no delivery agent and the learning was child-led. 
- It is a gifting intervention that provides personalized educational resources to children in foster care, with resources including books, stationary items and mathematical games.
- Parcels are delivered to the child on a monthly basis over a six-month period. The intervention does not rely on, expect or demand foster carer involvement.


##### Head Start 
- This is non -standardized in its setting, delivery agent, and duration.
- It is a holistic, wraparound set of services intended to support disadvantaged pre-school-age children. 


##### The Fostering Individualized Assistance Program (FIAP)
- It is delivered by family specialists who serve as family-centered, clinical case managers and home-based counselors working across all settings in tailoring services for individual children.
- On receipt of a referral, the specialist advises the welfare agency, advocates for the young person, and investigates alternative school options.


##### The Way Home

- The intervention was delivered to young people who had left residential care.
- It is a 12-month intervention to support the transition of youth with or at risk of disabilities as they reintegrate into the home following a stay in out-of-home care. 
- Each family is assigned a trained family consultant who delivers the majority of the intervention.
- The program integrates three interventions. Over the duration of the intervention family consultants spend approximately 138 hours with each family.


## Power Calculation of the intended effect of an intervention:

To detect the intended effect of an intervention a power calculation is required to determine the appropriate sample size.

* Both the evaluation of the individual-level Teach Your Children Well and the 30-week group-based Teach Your Children Well were sufficiently powered.
* A target sample of 130 participants is required in order for the RCT to yield an 80% chance of finding a significant difference, but only a sample of 34 was achieved.
* Evaluation of the Letterbox Club was sufficiently powered to detect a minimum effect size of d = 0.47 (alpha = 0.05, estimated adjusted R2 = 0.60), but based on an anticipated effect size of between 0.20 and 0.30 the trial was underpowered.
*  The remaining studies did not report a power calculation.


### Risks across the studies:
* Seven studies did not report the use of random sequence generation in the randomization process.
* Fourteen studies did not report on allocation concealment.
* In social interventions blinding is often unfeasible. Thus, although studies were unclear about how much knowledge individuals had of their trial status, we can assume a level of risk.
* Thirteen studies were unclear if evaluators were blinded when assessing outcomes. 
* Seven studies were judged to have a low risk of bias with more than 80% retention at follow-up. Another seven studies were judged to have a high risk of bias either due to a retention rate of less than 80% at follow-up, an imbalance of incomplete data across intervention and control groups, or failure to generate unbiased estimates of missing data in analysis. One study was unclear about the completeness of outcome data.
* No studies stipulated that a protocol was published in advance of the review, and no protocols could be located. It is, therefore, unclear if all outcomes are reported.
* Although RCTs should prevent the issue of confounding, as the intervention constitutes the only significant difference between the intervention and the control group, reported baseline differences combined with inadequate randomization procedures, ensured that it remained a risk.


## Outcomes of interventions


##### Kids in Transition to School 
* measured early literacy skills in children aged six and under, finding a small effect of 0.26.


##### Head Start 
* also found an effect at 6 months post-baseline (ß = 0.16, p = 0.02) which was reported as significant. 
* At 18 months post-baseline there was no significant direct intervention effect, but there was a modest indirect effect, with gains in pre-academic skills, the establishment of positive teacher-child relationships and change in behaviour problems during Head Start predicting higher pre-academic skills in the following year.
* Head Start, measured teacher-student relationships. At six months post-baseline there was a significant effect for the intervention (ß = 0.30, p &lt; .01), with an indirect intervention effect at 18 months.


##### The individual-level Teach Your Children Well

* Reported positive effects on sentence comprehension (E.S. = 0.38, p = .035) and math computation (E.S. = 0.46, p= .009). There was no significant impact on word reading or spelling.
* It was reported that single children had significant improvements in word reading, sentence comprehension, reading composite, and maths, while sibling pairs only indicated significance for math computation.
* The evaluation found that ADHD, mental health, internalized and externalized behaviors, as defined by the Child Behavior Checklist, moderated the relationship between the intervention and academic skills.


##### The 25-week group-level Teach Your Children Well
* The study found a significant effect on reading (E.S. = 0.42, p = .002) and spelling (E.S. = 0.38, p= .004), but not sentence comprehension or math computation, although the latter fell within the substantively important range.


##### The 30-week, group-level Teach Your Children Well
* It found an effect on reading (E.S. = 0.40), spelling (E.S. = 0.25, p = .02), and math computation (E.S. = 0.34, p = .044), but not sentence comprehension. 
* The study found a moderating role for school stability on reading scores, with only a significant effect for the intervention when school instability was high (p &lt; .001) or medium (p &lt; .001).


##### Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care for Adolescents

* Evaluation of group-based Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care for Adolescents indicated no impact on scholastic or language skills.
* Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care for young girls leaving the youth justice system was evaluated for homework completion on three days in a one-week period at 3–6 months and 12 months post-baseline. At both time points the intervention group spent more days on homework than the control group; individuals in the intervention group spent approximately 150% more days in a week on homework at 12 months post-baseline, while the control group experienced a decline in the time allocated to this task.
* School attendance was assessed and it was found that Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care for young girls leaving the juvenile system had an effect at the p &lt; .05 level at 12 months post-baseline. 
* Evaluation of the Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care for Adolescents found no effect on attendance (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 0.48,13.1).


##### The Letterbox Club 

* Evaluation of the Letterbox Club reported no effect on reading accuracy, reading comprehension, or reading rate. 
* In the trial of education specialists, it reported differences between the intervention group and control group at baseline but no significant differences at follow-up for maths test achievement scores (p = .082) or reading test achievement scores (p = .448).
* It measured the impact on attitude towards reading, which included recreational reading and academic reading, in addition to the liking of school. At approximately eight months post-baseline there was no impact on these outcomes.


##### ESTEP programme
* The ESTEP programme found no impacts on letter word identification, calculation or passage comprehension.
* The authors hypothesize that a large number of young people enter care due to mental health and behavioral problems, with this being evidenced by the fact that 6.5% of the study sample tested positive for post-traumatic stress, 35.1% reported having been in special educational programs prior to the study, and 26.1% reported a learning disability. 
* They suggest that the graduate students who delivered the intervention did not have the specialist training necessary to serve these youth, and specialist teachers may be more appropriate delivery agents.
* found no effect on grade completion at 26.8-month follow-up.
* It assessed the impact on school behavior, which was a composite measure of getting along with teachers; paying attention in school; getting your homework done; getting along with other students, and arriving on time for class. At approximately 2 years post-baseline the intervention demonstrated no effect.


##### Education specialists
* indicated no impact at 24 months post-baseline
* At baseline, 18 young people in the intervention group were in special education, and this was reduced to nine at 24-month follow up. In the control group the number decreased from 10 to seven. The significance of these findings is not presented.
* At 24 months post-baseline the number of schools attended dropped from an average of 1.30 to 1.18 in the intervention group, and from 1.28 to 1.12 in the control group. There was no significant difference between the group at baseline but significant at the p &lt; .05 level at follow-up, with the suggestion of a more favorable outcome in the control group.


##### Fostering Individualized Assistance Programme
* indicated that at 42-month follow-up those in the control group were 2.5 times more likely to engage in an extreme proportion of days on suspension (>1% of school days).
* When the population was separated into a younger and older subset, there was no significant effect for the younger group but a significant impact was retained for the older category, with the control group being more than four times as likely to be suspended.
* evaluation of the family-specialist coordinated programme did not find any impact on the extreme number of school-to-school movements, which is defined as more than three placements per year.



##### On the Way Home 
* reported that young people in the control group were more than three times more likely to leave school compared to those in the intervention group at 12-months post-baseline (E.S. = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.12,0.75).


## Shortfalls and Responses of the interventions:

* In the ESTEP programme only 61% of the intervention group received the programme. Due to the transience of placements, many youths were no longer situated in the foster home listed for tutoring at the time of commencement.
* The individual-level Teach Your Children Well reported a number of endogenous and exogenous barriers to uptake, including busy caregivers; conflict between carer and children; the child was already doing well in school; carer illness; changes in young people’s placements; or practical barriers to completing evaluation assessments (Flynn et al., 2012). As a result of these factors, 29% of the intervention group did not receive tutoring.
* Nine studies reporting on five interventions documented adherence, with measurements suggesting variation in implementation practices across studies. E
* valuation of Kids in Transition to School reported high levels of adherence, with 100% of intervention materials being covered in the caregiver group and 98% in the school readiness group.
* In the ESTEP programme, it was found that 28% of young people received less than 20 hours, 33% received between 21 hours and 40 hours, and 28% received more than 40 hours, meaning a number of participants received less than the intended intervention amount.
* Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care for Adolescents, found that by the end of the intervention only 45% of participants remained in their placement, meaning that the full course of the programme was not delivered to many.
* In the individual-level Teach Your Children Well - 21 cases reported high fidelity, 2 medium fidelity and 7 low fidelities.
* The group-based Teach Your Children Well also reported issues with fidelity to the maths curriculum, where tutors struggled in delivery.
* Despite the inclusion of process evaluation data in studies, there was limited linkage to outcome data or mediator or moderator analysis. Evaluation of the individual-level Teach Your Children Well was the only study to construct implementation as a moderator for intervention outcomes, identifying those higher levels of fidelity in delivering the reading curriculum offered an advantage in maths scores.
* Five studies reporting on three interventions explored acceptability for both delivery agents and participating young people. In the Teach, Your Children Well intervention, 79% of foster parents stated they would recommend it, with a further 14% claiming they would recommend it with hesitation.
* In the evaluation of the Letterbox Club acceptability among children was variable. Some participants expressed appreciation of individual books, while some felt that the included materials were not pitched at the right level or they had received a book as a gift at a different time. Some participants were found to already be ‘book burdened’ rather than ‘book deprived’ and increasing access to such resources did not necessarily increase reading opportunities


## Recommendation: 
* Expert recommendation identified an RCT currently being undertaken and due to report imminently.
* The Fostering Healthy Futures programme is a manualized skills group that aims to reduce stigma and provide opportunities to learn social and emotional competencies within a supportive environment.
	* Groups are delivered for 30 weeks, lasting approximately 1.5 hrs each week, and comprise two trained facilitators and 8–10 children. 
	* The intervention is informed by the evidence-based PATHS curriculum and the Second Step approach.
	* Mentoring is also provided by graduate students in social work, who act as role model and advocate for the young person, meeting with them for 2–4 hours per week. 
	* An RCT has been conducted with 156 children aged 9–11 in foster care due to maltreatment. 
	* The primary outcome was mental health, and at 15 months post-baseline the intervention groups scored significantly lower on multi-informant measures of poor mental health. Secondary educational outcomes were measured as part of the trial and analysis is currently being undertaken.



## For further discussion

* The issue of contamination offers insight into the complexity of conducting RCTs within social contexts where notions of ‘usual care’ can be amorphous and the transience of populations can make it problematic to retain the integrity of randomization.
* Process evaluation data revealed some issues with intervention delivery, which may have importance for study replication, while also introducing the risk of Type 3 errors, whereby interventions are rejected for being inherently theoretically faulty when the problem lies with implementation procedures.
* The review indicated that evaluations were conducted in a limited range of countries, with all but two being undertaken in North America. Equally, Teach Your Children Well was the only intervention to be replicated, although this was in the same context as the original study.
* A further key omission from studies was economic evaluation conducting a cost-benefit analysis of the relative savings offered in comparison to usual care.
* when interventions are replicated across settings, we should expect them to manifest in different ways in order to accommodate contextual specificities while activating the same set of causal processes in the generation of outcomes. 
* Based on the included studies it is premature to make any claims about intervention impact due to the variable quality of study conduct and reporting.
