# Need for a comprehensive school health policy:

- Universal Primary Education (UPE) is one of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) whose achievement depends on due attention to the health of the school-age children.
- Ill health is partly due to poor quality water, sanitation, hygiene and other related factors. These factors include poor housing, parasitic infections, infectious diseases, macro and micronutrient deficiencies, HIV and AIDS and sexually transmitted infections.
- In addition, problems encountered, especially during adolescence such as unplanned pregnancy, substance use and abuse, sexual harassment and other forms of abuse, also contribute to poor health of children.
- Many school environments are themselves risky, resulting in injuries and accidents that can be avoided. It is imperative that the environment should be made safe and suitable for all children in order to avoid the occurrence of such accidents.
- A school health policy will enable the Government to utilize available resources in an effective and efficient manner towards child health. This policy provides a coordination mechanism that enhances the roles of the various ministries, institutions and stakeholders.
- Successful interpretation and implementation of this policy is expected to improve the health status of school children. The policy also addresses issues related to equity and improvement on the learning environment for both boys and girls, including those with special needs.
- The rationale is that children with improved health will participate and perform well in education, resulting in acceptable levels of attainment in terms of education indicators agreed between us as a nation.
- The school health policy will fill the gaps that have been identified in order to harmonize and strengthen existing School Health interventions.
- The Policy is purposed to:
  - Provide a legal framework for implementation of a Comprehensive School Health Programme
  - Provide clear leadership for ownership and sustainability
  - Give a guide to programme implementation.
- Clear-cut policy guidelines are necessary so as to promote partnership, cooperation, collaboration and commitment among the Government ministries and stakeholders in order to create value for health and education in line with the Millennium Development Goals.
- **Why schools?** :
  - Schools are ideal settings to implement health programmes, because they offer substantial opportunities to promote health including:
    - Schools provide an efficient and effective channel to reach large portions of the population for introducing health promotion practices
    - Schools can provide interventions in a variety of ways (learning experiences, linkages to services, supportive environment);
    - Schools admit learners at the early stages of their development when lifelong behaviours, values, skills and attitudes are being formed
    - Improved health enhances cognitive development, concentration, participation and retention of children in school. It also reduces absenteeism, increases enrolment and improves academic performance.

# Key Practices in a school health policy:

A comprehensive school health programme meets a greater proportion of health and psychosocial needs of children in and out of school. The components of a CSHP include:

- Values and life skills
- Gender issues
- Child Rights, Child Protection and Responsibilities
- Water, Sanitation and Hygiene
- Nutrition
- Disease prevention and control
- Special needs, disabilities and rehabilitation
- School infrastructure and environmental safety.

These components can be understood with respect to the key practices they are a part of, such as the following:

## Access to health and nutritional services

- Every child has a right to quality health and nutrition services. School establishments are expected to be the tool towards achieving this goal in partnership with the communities in and out of school. Access to health and nutrition services shall be facilitated for vulnerable groups.
- Good nutrition is essential to realize the learning potential of children and to maximize returns on educational investments. Malnutrition affects a child&#39;s attentiveness, concentration, aptitude and overall performance. Efforts shall be made to promote good nutrition practices in schools by integrating nutrition interventions including micronutrient supplementation into school activities.
- The following shall be implemented in order to optimize school nutrition services:
  - Links shall be promoted between routine health and nutrition services and school activities, including regular monitoring of nutritional status of children
  - Support shall be provided for the referral of malnourished children to health facilities, counselling services, feeding programmes and other community agencies and services which can respond to identified needs
  - Schools shall have gardens, including container gardens in urban schools for demonstration purposes and as a resource for learning more about nutrition
  - Local communities shall be involved in the production of nutritious food
  - Learning institutions shall offer nutritious food of good quality and in adequate quantity
  - Food handlers shall undergo regular medical examination.

### Enhancing Nutrition Education in Schools

  - The following shall be implemented in order to enhance nutrition education in schools:
    - Curricula shall be regularly reviewed and updated in order to enhance nutrition information
    - Emphasis shall be laid on the use of locally available foods
    - Teachers shall be well trained and in-serviced on nutrition issues.

### School Feeding Programme (SFP)

  - School feeding programmes contribute to decreased hunger, which helps children concentrate on their studies. This helps to increase the attention and concentration of learners, thereby producing gains in cognitive function and learning.
  - The programmes should also address specific micronutrient deficiencies in school-age children. The most important of these are Vitamin A, iodine, iron and folic acid which directly or indirectly affect cognition, and can translate into better school performance.
  - The school feeding programme shall have three components
    - Provision of balanced meals for children in all schools
    - Encouraging children in day schools to carry nutritious snacks and lunch
    - Supplementary feeding for children from the most underserved, food insecure regions, from pockets of poverty and those affected by natural and man-made disasters.
  - Community involvement and ownership of school feeding programmes greatly increases the programme&#39;s success and sustainability. For these reasons
    - Communities shall be involved in planning, mobilization of resources and the management of school feeding programmes.
    - Communities shall be encouraged to ensure a minimum level of local food production to ensure sustainability

## Access to safe water, sanitation &amp; hygiene

- Every child has a right to access safe drinking water and adequate sanitation. Provision of safe water and sanitation shall be complemented by appropriate hygiene promotion and education.
- A healthy and hygienic school environment is actualized by safe, adequate water supply, adequate sanitation and appropriate hygiene promotion.
- The following measures shall be undertaken:
  - School managements and parents shall be encouraged and empowered to provide adequate ablution facilities for boys and girl as prescribed in the School Health Rules &amp; Regulations, &quot;Building code&quot; and Public Health Act.
  - Ablution facilities shall be designed and constructed to suit the different age groups and special needs

  - Adequate, safe drinking water points/fountains shall be available in each school
  - Schools management shall provide sufficient and strategically located litter bins, garbage disposal pits, incinerators, and ensure proper management of liquid wastes
  - Where the school has a kitchen, appropriate food safety measures and adequate waste disposal shall be ensured.
  - Standards for toilet/latrines and all other sanitation facilities shall be regularly reviewed and updated
  - Care shall be taken to ensure that the toilet/latrine standards are relevant to the different geographic conditions in the country and that they are sensitive to the varying category of users needs
  - Effective monitoring shall be in inbuilt in each school, zone and district
  - Key to the monitoring will be to ensure that the ablution and sanitation facilities are used consistently by pupils and that they are well maintained, and hygiene promotion is on-going
  - Hygiene promotion will be pupil centered and an ongoing process whose spillover effect from the schools to homes will positively influence behaviour change
  - Learners and other school community members suffering from hygiene-related conditions such as jiggers or lice infestation, ringworm etc shall access treatment without discrimination or ridicule
  - School management and stakeholders shall ensure that the environment around the schools remains healthy
  - Resource mobilization mechanism and budget line for construction, operation and maintenance of sanitation &amp; hygiene shall be strengthened
  - District Education Office and key partners will be equipped to support and provide guidance on good management, monitoring and evaluation.

### Disease prevention and control:

  - Schools shall be required to ensure that they take measures to prevent diseases through health education and implementation of preventive interventions. Some of these diseases are:
    
#### HIV, AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs):

- All learning institutions have a responsibility to address HIV, AIDS and STIs through education by developing skills and values and changing attitudes to promote positive behaviours.
- All existing policies on HIV/AIDS and STI control shall be adhered to
- There shall be no discrimination of HIV positive learners, teachers and staff
- No school is permitted to require a learner or its employee to undertake an HIV test
- Learners and staff infected by HIV/AIDS or STI shall be allowed to access treatment including antiretroviral therapy (ART) and regular checkups
- Efforts shall be made to strengthen AIDs control units in education institution in order to prevent spread of the disease
- Voluntary Counselling and Testing centres (VCT) shall be accessible to the school community

#### Tuberculosis:

- Tuberculosis (TB) is transmitted through the air. This therefore means that children can be at risk of getting infected if an infectious case is within the school
- The following measures shall be taken to prevent and manage TB in schools:
	- Classrooms shall be spacious and with adequate ventilation and lighting to prevent TB transmission
	- Teachers shall screen learners who have a chronic cough and refer those whose cough has lasted more that two weeks
	- Children and entire school community shall be taught cough hygiene and encouraged not to spit in the compound
	- Children, members of staff and community members will be sensitized on TB treatment and encouraged to ensure that the sick complete the course of treatment and to attend clinics as advised.
    
#### Malaria:
- School malaria preventive and control programs should include the following:
	- Vector Control using Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs): Schools shall ensure use of ITNs in particular the long lasting Insecticide Treated Nets (LLITNs).
	- Malaria prevention in Pregnancy: The MOPHS shall ensure access to Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs) and Intermittent Presumptive Treatment (IPT) for pregnant members of the school community

    - Information, Education and Communication:
        - The MOPHS shall provide materials with information to better arm learners and the surrounding communities with preventive and treatment knowledge. Schools shall be involved in dissemination of malaria control materials and messages.
        - Integrated Vector Management (IVM): Schools shall be involved in the roll out of Integrated Vector Management which includes all the above strategies and environmental management to destroy mosquito breeding habitat
        - Malaria Case Management: The school health teachers shall be trained on early recognition of signs and symptoms of malaria, and on when to refer patients to an appropriate health facility; The MOPHS shall ensure accessibility to prompt and effective malaria treatment.
    
#### Neglected diseases and Diseases targeted for Elimination:

- Schools provide a good environment for control of neglected diseases (e.g. intestinal worms, bilharzia, filariasis, kala azar etc) and diseases targeted for elimination (e.g. Guinea Worm, etc).
- Children are particularly susceptible to intestinal worms and bilharzia through contaminated soil and water, respectively. Intestinal worm and bilharzia infestation can result in chronic and long-lasting health problems.
- Chronic worm infestations often make children malnourished, anaemic and vulnerable to illnesses, thereby contributing to decreased cognitive development, low concentration, low intellectual and physical performance and school absenteeism.
- For these reasons:
	- Treatment shall be administered to all school-age children, including those out of school, based on the prevalence and intensity of worms and bilharzia in the area in order to reduce infection.
	- The school curriculum shall emphasize skill-based health education and promotion with emphasis on safe water, environmental sanitation and hygiene for worm control.
    
#### Immunization:
- Immunizable diseases are a major cause of child mortality. The following measures shall be undertaken to ensure full immunization of children:
	- School Managements shall ensure that all children enrolling to join school are fully immunized against childhood diseases according to the existing National Immunization Policy
	- Children not immunized shall not be barred from school but all necessary steps shall be taken to facilitate their full immunization
	- The Ministry of Public Health & Sanitation and Ministry Education shall provide an enabling environment for any other immunization that may be deemed necessary for school-age children
	- Schools and the entire community shall be sensitized on the importance of full immunization of children and service delivery points within their reach.
    
#### Non-communicable Diseases:
- Although a majority of non-communicable diseases occur during adulthood, they are caused by accumulated exposure to major risk factors resulting from unhealthy lifestyle, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity from childhood; and hereditary factors.
- For these reasons the following measures will be ensured:
	- Schools shall educate children on the predisposing factors and prevention of non-communicable diseases.
	- Emphasis will be laid on healthy lifestyles including diets, physical activity, control of drug /substance of abuse, mental health and other lifestyles.
    
#### Tobacco, Alcohol, Substance and Drug Use and Abuse:

        - Schools shall arrange to have oral health check-ups once a year.
        - Schools will encourage their learners to start oral health interventions within school health clubs.
    
#### Eye care:

- Visual impairment therefore needs to be identified and managed as early as possible.The following shall be implemented in all schools:
	- Visual acuity check shall be done before admission to school
	- Annual school eye screening shall be conducted by MOPHS, MOMS and MOE in collaboration with stakeholders
	- All children under five years including those in schools shall be given Vitamin A supplements after every 6 months
