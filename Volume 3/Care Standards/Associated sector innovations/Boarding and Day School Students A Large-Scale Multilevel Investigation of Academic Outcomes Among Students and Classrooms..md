# Brief:

* Scope & Description: 

    This study explored the motivation, engagement, and achievement of boarding and day students who are educated in the same classrooms and receive the same syllabus and instruction from the same teachers, found predominant parity between boarding and day students in their motivation, engagement, and achievement. We also found that classroom average motivation, engagement, and achievement were not significantly affected by the number of boarders

# Boarding Schools and Theoretical Frameworks


## Ecological Systems, Human Capital, Critical Race, Framework:

* Ecological systems theory emphasizes the ongoing personenvironment interactions that shape human development (Bronfenbrenner, 2001, 2005). 
* human development takes place through processes of progressively more complex reciprocal interaction between an active, evolving biopsychological human organism and the persons, objects, and symbols in its immediate external environment. To be effective, the interaction must occur on a fairly regular basis over extended periods of time
* boarding represents a somewhat intensive and on-going process of interactions between student and environment—interactions that have potential to shape students’ academic outcome
* According to Bronfenbrenner, because the boarding context plays a different role in shaping children’s academic development, it is conceivable boarding students’ academic outcomes may differ from those of day students.
* social and educational capital to explore the potential that boarding may (or may not) hold for improving life chances for disadvantaged youth through opportunities for meeting their social and educational needs.
* critical race theory (Aleman, 2013) that might suggest potentially challenging perspectives on boarding effects, particularly for some student groups.
*  boarding school may reproduce dominant cultural values through their daily practices, policies and procedures that are not appropriately sensitive or supportive of Indigenous students and their cultural and social-emotional needs.


## Social Identity Theory:

- Individuals’ self-concepts are based on their membership to their social group.
- when the individual has strong emotional connections to a group and when membership in a particular group is considered by the individual to be central to their self-concept
- self-esteem through affiliation with the group, typically through influential processes such as within-group assimilation and intergroup bias
- “self ” is not a fixed entity among students, but amenable to variation as a function of change in experience, including formal and informal learning at school.


## Extracurricular Perspectives

- Extracurricular activity is any out-of-class involvement that absorbs students’ energy, time, and attention. 
- “identification/commitment” model of extracurricular activity (Marsh, 1992) proposes that school-based extracurricular activities can “improve school identification, involvement, and commitment in a way that enhances narrowly defined academic outcomes
- school-based extracurricular activities are more likely to increase students’ affiliation with the school.
- context-specific affiliation (e.g., school affiliation) boosts students’ identification with and commitment to that context, resulting in positive academic outcomes.
- Thus, it is possible that one’s boarding status is linked with adaptive academic outcomes, consistent with what might be hypothesized for school-based extracurricular activity under the “identification/commitment” perspective


# Literature relevant to boarding school experience


## Positive & Negative Effects of Boarding:

* boarding students were more likely to report they were satisfied with their academic experience and were more likely to report that school prepared them for college.
* boarding instills independence and acceptance of cultural diversity.
* boarding for disadvantaged students enhanced their exposure to social and educational capital.
* found predominant parity between boarding and day students (described below), but where small effects were identified, they favored boarders.
* potentially positive outcomes for boarding students.
*  research documenting negative effects of boarding for some children. mental health and wellbeing among high school boarders (boys) as they transitioned to and into boarding school.
* They found increases in emotional problems among boarding students over time. 
* They also found that academic motivation declined over time; however, this was the case for both boarders and day students. 
* boarding and day students reported increases in depression, anxiety, and emotional symptoms between Grades 7 and 9, but that boarding students reported higher levels of anxiety and stress than day students at the end of Grade 8. 
* It has also been documented how some boarding schools are contexts perpetuating institutional and societal power structures and problematic ideologies—such as those around gender


## Null Boarding Effects 

* there is not a major difference in educational outcomes when comparing boarding and day school students. 
* relatively few differences (with small effect sizes) in academic wellbeing (e.g., domain-general academic motivation and engagement) and personal wellbeing.
* no major changes in self-concept through this transition. 
* found that disadvantaged students in boarding initially experienced low levels of wellbeing, but their wellbeing adjusted during their boarding experience. 
* They also found boarders experienced academic gains 2 years after commencing boarding, but this effect did not generalize across students.


## Insights From Particular Student Groups

* in a study of Indigenous girls in a residential college it was found they enjoyed their residential experience and the new friendships developed, but also found that homesickness and lifestyle restrictions were a challenge for the girls.
* Indigenous students reported that boarding allowed enhanced career opportunities and health outcomes, but that there were issues to navigate to attain these outcomes such as homesickness, racism, and post-school transition difficulties.
* positive possibilities of boarding school for Indigenous students, but also noted the evidence does not always support the positive potential. 


# DOMAIN-GENERAL AND DOMAIN-SPECIFIC OUTCOMES


## Target Domains and Outcomes Under Focus 

* Our domain-specific focus is science—specifically motivation, engagement, and achievement in science. 
* Exploring these issues in science is somewhat topical because there are concerning trends in science achievement and science pathways.
* science participation and enrollments among senior school students demonstrate longterm decline (Office of the Chief Scientist, 2014) and there is concern about students’ declining interest in science in high school
* motivation, engagement, and achievement have been identified as outcome targets for improvement in science and there have been recommendations for researchers to explore factors that may be implicated in these outcomes.
* to ascertain if potential boarding status effects are distinct to science or not, we also assess the role of boarding status in motivation and engagement for school in general.
* Thus, motivation and engagement can be either a means to desirable outcomes, or desirable outcomes in their own right—and it is the conceptualizing, research questions, and research design that determine where in the educational process they are modeled
* seek to systematically build on the recent largescale quantitative study by Martin et al. (2014), the main motivation and engagement measures employed by them; namely, positive motivation (e.g., self-efficacy), positive engagement (e.g., persistence), negative motivation (e.g., anxiety), and negative engagement (e.g., self-handicapping).


## Background Attributes

* boarding status may be associated with various student background attributes that are also linked with motivation, engagement, and achievement.
* important to include such attributes in modeling in order to partial out their potential influence.
* numerous such factors, including age, gender, socio-economic status, language background, Indigenous status, parent education, prior achievement, and personality.
* if boarding represents a distinct educational ecology and socializing environment, then time spent in that environment (i.e., years in boarding school) may affect one’s identification with and internalization of that environment, including academic effects of the experience.
* background attributes are also included in the present study as predictors of motivation, engagement, and achievement.
*  background attributes may moderate the effects of boarding.
* identified research revealing a negative history of boarding school for some students and in part this has been attributed to the commencement of boarding at a young age
* Thus, we include interaction terms (e.g., boarding status × Indigenous status, boarding status × age, boarding status × extraversion, etc.) to test for the potential moderating role of the study’s background attributes.


## Multilevel Considerations

* There is widespread recognition of how important it is to analyze hierarchical data in appropriate ways
* students nested within classrooms and therefore conduct multilevel modeling to account for this and to understand variance attributable to student- and classroom-levels. 
* There are known statistical biases associated with single-level research designs.
* To our knowledge only one study has investigated boarding from a multilevel perspective—Martin et al. (2016) investigated motivation and social climates among students nested within boarding houses that were nested within schools
* Multilevel modelers have established the reciprocity of individual and group dynamics: individuals can affect the group to which they belong and in turn the group can affect these individuals
* When conducting multilevel modeling it is also important to establish whether climate or context effects are being investigated. Climate refers to shared perception of a characteristic of the group (e.g., classroom) that is common to members (e.g., students) in that group.


# Aims of the study

* The first aim was to explore, in a large-scale sample, the role of boarding in students’ domain-general academic motivation and engagement. 
* The second aim was to also explore the role of boarding in students’ domain-specific (science) motivation, engagement, and achievement. 
* The third aim was to investigate the association between the proportion of boarders in a classroom (relative to day students) and classroom-average motivation, engagement, and achievement—beyond the student-level motivation, engagement.


# Methodology

## Sample: 

Participants were 2,803 high school students from 6 Australian schools that comprised both boarding and day students.


## Materials:


### Science Motivation and Engagement 

* Science motivation and engagement were assessed using the Motivation and Engagement Scale—High School (MES-HS)
* Positive motivation in science comprised mastery orientation, self-efficacy, valuing.
* Positive science engagement comprised task management, planning behavior and persistence 
* Negative science motivation was measured with anxiety, failure avoidance, and uncertain control 
* Negative science engagement was assessed via disengagement, self-handicapping.


### Domain-General Motivation and Engagement

* Domain-general academic motivation and engagement were assessed using the short form of the Motivation and Engagement. 
* This measures all 11 factors represented in the Motivation and Engagement Scale, but does so via one item per factor.
* Positive domain-general academic motivation constituted self-efficacy, and mastery orientation.
* Positive engagement comprised planning behavior, task management, and persistence.
* Negative motivation comprised anxiety, failure avoidance, and uncertain control
* negative engagement comprised self-handicapping  and disengagement.


### Science Achievement 

* Science achievement was assessed using an online test. It comprised 12 questions developed by the science department head of a large Sydney school.
* Questions were set within the contexts of content strands Earth and Space, Physical World, Chemical World, and Living World
* aligned with students’ skill level and what they had been taught— and considered a snapshot of their scientific literacy
* reviewed each test item in terms of: (a) alignment with the state science syllabus, (b) language and cultural accessibility of item text/graphics, and (c) the envisaged percentage of students likely to correctly answer an item


###   Background Attributes

* prior achievement
* gender (0 = male, 1 = female), 
* language background (0 = English speaking, 1 = nonEnglish speaking), 
* Indigenous status (0 = non-Indigenous; 1 = Indigenous), 
* parents’ education (scale from 1 “No formal qualifications
* Australian Bureau of Statistics SES values (a continuous score, ranging from relatively greater socio-economic disadvantage to relatively greater socio-economic advantage.


### Personality 
* We were also interested in the extent to which boarding status accounted for variance beyond existing personality traits (in line with recommendations by Martin et al., 2014). 
* A brief personality scale (Gosling et al., 2003) was administered, consisting in our study of a single item measure for each personality factor.


# Discussion

* After controlling for background and personality attributes, we found predominant parity between boarding and day students in their motivation, engagement, and achievement. 
* We also found that motivation, engagement, and achievement at the class-level were not significantly affected by the number of boarders in the classroom. 
* In addition, the effects of boarding were generally not moderated by students’ background or personality attributes.


## Student-Level and Classroom-Level Effects: Boarding vs. Day Status

* The two groups were educated in the same classrooms and received the same syllabus and instruction from the same teachers. 
* In fact, the clustering of students in the same classrooms enabled us to extend prior research by investigating the extent to which the number of boarders in a (science) classroom had an impact on class-average motivation, engagement, and achievement outcomes.
* Our findings showed that the proportion of boarders in the classroom (relative to day students) was not significantly associated with class-average science outcomes.
* multilevel design was important to help better ascertain the nature of boarding effects. With this design we could disentangle student-level (Level 1) variance from classlevel (Level 2) variance. In doing so it was evident that boarding status was not associated with science outcomes at either level there were boarding effects for domain-general motivation and engagement
* In our study, positive engagement comprised task management, planning and monitoring, and persistence factors. 
* These are behavioral dimensions that may be quite responsive to the structured nature of study conditions in boarding contexts
* Moreover, over time, boarding students may come to internalize these behaviors as their own capacities, further contributing to higher self-reported domain-general positive engagement. Interestingly, this was not the case for the domain-specific counterpart


## Background and Personality Attributes


* there were significant bivariate associations among background attributes, boarding status, and academic outcomes—suggesting a need in our multivariate modeling to account for variance attributable to background attributes when assessing the unique relationship between boarding status and academic outcomes.
* Without adjusting for relevant background and personality attributes, raw comparisons may lead to biased results.
* It has also been suggested that there may be some students for whom boarding may offer particular benefit.
* perhaps boarding is better suited to students high in extraversion. We were able to test these possibilities through interaction effects (e.g., boarding × Indigenous status; boarding × extraversion
*  Of the 108 possible interaction effects, only three attained our benchmark for interpretability
* Taking our main and interaction effects together, then, it appears that including background and personality factors as main covariate effects is important when understanding boarding status, but it may not be necessary to model these background and personality factors as moderators of boarding status.


## Practical Implications

* For parents, one of their main concerns is that their child has educational opportunities and access on par with other students in a school. Indeed Lawrence (2005) identified that parents choose to board their child for various opportunities (e.g., extracurricular activity) and a structured and stable learning environment. 
* Our findings suggest they receive such support— at least, to the extent that they evince academic outcomes comparable with day students. 
* Many parents also send their child to board because, for one reason or another, their child does not have optimal educational access (e.g., due to geographic distance, etc.). 
* We found that boarders’ results on motivation, engagement, and achievement were comparable to that of day students and we infer that this reflects equal opportunity and access for boarding students
*  There were no significant differences in these academic outcomes as a function of whether there were fewer or more boarders in the class.
* schools need not factor in the ratio of boarders to day students when deciding on class composition. 
* On the issue of access and opportunity, the general lack of moderation effects suggested no differences in academic outcomes between subgroups of boarders (and day students).
* questions about whether cultural identity may be unduly affected by the boarding experience or whether gender may play out in problematic ways in boarding contexts.
* no problematic patterns of interaction effects that would suggest issues along these lines: the general parity in academic outcomes between boarding and day students was found irrespective of a student’s background and personality attributes.
* whether a student is a boarder or not, educational support to compensate low SES status or low prior achievement is required
*  although our study found predominant parity between boarders and day students and no interaction effects of note, there is no question that the transition from one’s community (and day school) to boarding school is a major one
*  boarding staff can harness positive relationships with students to enhance students’ educational participation, mental health, and self-responsibility.
* Qualitative data from Indigenous boarding students and staff have also identified how boarding schools can be physically designed to optimize a sense of belonging. 
*  These include flexible spaces to foster relationships inside the boarding house, student voice in how spaces are designed and arranged, and spaces that provide “cultural relief ”

## Limitations, Future Directions

* First, we speculated that the boarding context comprises routines, structures, and interactions with educational support staff that are unique to that context—and that this may yield particular educational effects relative to day students. 
* However, we did not have data on these factors in this study. We also did not have data on where boarders were from, including cohorts within the boarding sub-sample
* therefore do not know if boarders from different areas evince different motivation, engagement, and achievement patterns and we cannot as fully contextualize the findings derived in this study
* identify more distinct effects particular to the boarding context and to whom these effects apply
* study focused on high school students, not younger students in elementary school settings. Theories of attachment (e.g., Ainsworth and Bowlby, 1991) have emphasized the influential role of parents in children’s lives and it is possible that boarding reduces these important influences and may stunt personal development for younger students.
* Third, given our cross-sectional data, there are questions about factor and causal ordering which may be answered by collecting data that monitors students who move from day status to boarding status and vice versa
* Third, given our cross-sectional data, there are questions about factor and causal ordering which may be answered by collecting data that monitors students who move from day status to boarding status and vice versa
* it is important to also control for more specific social-emotional wellbeing state-like measures.
* Fourth, there is a need for more intensive real-time data. Recent research using mobile technology to capture realtime motivation and engagement has revealed in-the-moment variance in motivation and engagement 
*  It is therefore encouraging that the motivation and engagement measurement tool used in this study has been validated among Indigenous students
* Future research might conduct person-centered analyses (e.g., latent profile analysis) to explore potential subgroups of boarders for whom it is a negative experience and examine the reasons why and the impact of this negative experience on their academic outcomes. 
* the majority of students in this study were boys. Because of this, we conducted numerous additional statistical analyses leading us to tentatively conclude that gender composition did not disproportionately or unreasonably impact factors and empirical associations in this study.
* Another important feature of analyses was our modeling of SES as a covariate in analyses to control for variation attributable to it when seeking to identify unique boarding effects
* yielded a finding of predominant parity between boarding and day students. Thus, in the context of a history of negative effects of boarding on young people’s development (Duffell, 2000), our finding of predominant parity is significant.
