## **ASHA: 8 Tasks**

### Knowing your village people
- requires participation of everyoneâ€”the people, the nurse, the anganwadi, the Dai, the schoolteachers and the village Panchayat. You also need the help of doctor.
- Village people have many difficulties. They depend on land and farming. Some of them also work as wage labourers in nearby towns.
- They are grouped as below poverty line (BPL) as per Government criteria.
- Often they come from scheduled castes, tribes and other marginalized groups
- The poor people, the women, the children and adolescents and old people need health care more often
- People should be involved in village health planning to assess health needs and also help in selecting appropriate solutions to address the common problems
- Health care is not isolated, but part of the whole life of the village

### Village Health Plan

- ASHA should participate in Village health planning and help nursedidi, anganwadi behen, and Panchayat members

## How to remain healthy?

- avoid marriage among blood relatives to avoid some of these inborn defects.
- Low purchasing power limits access to adequate amount of food and balanced diet
- Health depends upon factors like
  - Clean drinking water,
  - clean air
  - Balanced diet,
  - Healthy personal habits,
  - Healthy home and surroundings
  - Healthy working conditions.
  - Supportive family, friends and society
  - Staying away from vices like alcohol, tobacco, multiple partners etc.
  - Timely use of health services like immunization, birth

### Personal Hygiene Tips

- In India many people go to open fields for defecation. You need to help them in getting sanitary latrines installed
- You will get more information about construction of sanitary latrines from the block Panchayat office.
- After defecation, most use water-wash for anal clean up. This soils the hand with germs. It is necessary to wash the hands thoroughly after this, with soap or ash.
- You should ensure that your hands are clean, especially before eating any food. Wash your hands with plain water first and then with soap
  - Wash the hands with a lot of water first.
  - Apply soap or ashes and rub on the hands particularly the nails, tip of the fingers and between them.
  - Again, pour water. Dry it with a clean piece of cloth or napkin. Cutting nails regularly removes space for collection of dirt. .
- Brush the teeth toward the gums. Brush very gently so that any plaque growing under the gum will be removed
- We must have a good mouthwash after each meal. This will remove food particles and prevent the problems of tooth and gums
- Brush at least twice every day, before and after sleep. This would prevent plaque formation
  - Change the brush if the bristles look spread. A worn out toothbrush will not clean our teeth. Toothpaste is not always necessary for brushing. Therefore brushing is a cheap way to keep the teeth and gums healthy
  - 8-10 inches long and small finger thick twig of neem, babool or Karanj etc. This practice is good.
  - After chewing the twig a bit, the end becomes bristly.
- Massage with warm sesame or mustard oil is good before bath.
- Our undergarments and other clothes must be clean to keep away skin infections and louse infestation. A daily change is healthy practice.
- Proper footwear is necessary to keep away germs and worms in the dust from getting onto your feet
  - The worms present in the faeces may get entry in the body when we walk bare footed.
  - Dusty and hot weather also cracks our soles.
  - Some people buy shoes, only to use them during festivals or when going out to meet their friends and relatives.

## Water Safety at Home

- Many illnesses come from consumption of dirty water. Diarrhea, dysentery, cholera, jaundice etc are some such illnesses.
- Water becomes bad when disease-causing germs mix in. Germs come from human and animal excreta.
- Even minute quantities of excreta can make water unsafe. You may say that water appears to be clean but there may be deadly germs
- So rivers and streams get germs once they pass through human settlements. Water from shallow wells, ponds is also contaminated with germs.
- If necessary strain the water in a fold of cloth. It will remove bigger particles and some insects. Use a clean dhoti or sari
- Do not dip hands in the water container. Remember your hands may be dirty.
- Children are often in habit of taking water from vessel by dipping their hands especially after play. Use a ladle (handle-cup) instead
- We can also make water safer by boiling it for about 15-20 minutes after the rolling starts
- Take one liter water in a jar. Add a teaspoonful of well-kept bleaching powder to it
- Use the water after half an hour. Keep the stock solution well capped. Otherwise the chlorine gas escapes making it useless
- Never drink water you are not sure of. Water safety is possible at home, and at the village also.

### Disposal of Waste Water

- This dirty wastewater is from our baths, kitchens and cattleshades. Mosquitoes breed in such stagnated pools. They give us sleepless nights and malaria fever.
- Making a Soak pit Soak pit must be used to avoid pools of water, particularly in the streets and common pathways
- This will absorb drumfuls of water without forming a pool. This will avoid breeding places for mosquitoes.
- A Kitchen Garden
  - Kitchen garden is a way to use wastewater to produce vegetables for ourselves.
  - The plants use up the water and we get fresh vegetables at no extra cost
  - The vegetables we can grow are: fenugreek, spinach, dhaniya,carrots, tomatoes, gourds, lentils etc
- Making A Soap Pit
  - Dig a pit of 1.5 meter length, breadth and depth. At the bottom put loose stones and brickbats. After filling 1/3 of the pit put smaller half size brickbats. Fill 1/3 of the pit thus. Fill the top third of the pit even smaller brickbats
  - For this raise its borders by 10 centimeters above the ground level. Fill it with dry grass or coconut coir on top
  - This helps in straining. Connect the wastewater into this pot by using a pipe. Cover entire area with coir.

## Health Depends on the food we eat [[Nutrition]]

- Eating all types of food is necessary for keeping our body fighting fit.
- We need to eat more food when recovering from illness.
- A child needs more food for growth. So do adolescents.
- Heavy work requires more food.
- Men need little more food for energy in the body than women.
- A woman needs more food in pregnancy and breast feeding.
- She also needs supplement of iron and calcium.
- Certain foods need to be avoided in certain diseases.
- All grains and cereals are our staple food. They give us most of energy and proteins. But we need to eat enough of these. Similarly non veg. communities take meat and fish.
- Malnutrition contributes to more than half of childhood deaths.
- **Healthy Dietary Practices**
  - Avoid overeating. Always try to heat, when one feels appetite.
  - Do not skip meals for long intervals if there is no medical indication.
  - While eating the simple rule is â€“ donot overfill the stomach, one third of the stomach should remain empty for facilitating proper movements and digestion of food
  - We should eat thoroughly washed vegetables and fruits as well as cooked meals.
  - We should eat sprouted grains as often as possible. Such grains are rich with nutrients.
  - Washing and then cutting vegetables saves important vitamins and minerals. If we cut and then wash, these elements are wasted.
  - Iron vessels are good for cooking food as they provide iron. Use clean utensils for cooking food.
  - Covering food while cooking saves some vitamins. Fresh cooked food is better than stale food.
  - Avoid storing cooked food and store until next meal. Food should be covered to protect from dirt and insects.
  - Washing hands before cooking and eating prevents germs entering our bodies.
  - Feed children more often, 4-5 times a day.
  - They need to eat frequently. From one year onwards, child can eat from family pot.

### Balanced Diet

- Food has five basic elements: fats (fats from oils and ghee), proteins (white of egg, pulses-milk) carbohydrates (cereals, sugar, sweets), minerals like calcium or iron, and vitamins.
- Minerals and vitamins are necessary in minute quantities.
- Food grains like rice, wheat, sorghum, maize, ragi, bajra etc make the bulk of our daily food. They give us energy
- Green leafy vegetables and fruits help in blood formation. Vegetables also give us the fiber (roughage) necessary for normal bowel movements.
- Body requires some minerals like calcium, iron, iodine and zinc.
- A square meal has many colours. The grains are white or brown. Eggs and fish are also whitegrey. Milk and curds is white Pulses are yellow. So are fats and some fruits Leafy Vegetables are green. Fruits are mostly red and orange. So is meat and chicken.
- Combination of foods like pulses with grains (khichdi is good), and lemon with vegetables improves quality of food.Lemon, guava and Amla increase iron absorption and help make our blood
- Avoid junk foods
  - The costs are high in comparison to our usual foods e.g. Sattu made at home. So we have a double loss

### Healthy Weight

- A growing child gains weight regularly. Generally a child triples its birth weight at the age of one year.
- Adult maintains body weight. Weight reduces in old age.
- Pregnant women, breast-feeding mothers, growing children and adolescents have special nutritional needs.
- Underweight is because of under-eating. Majority of village women and young girls have low weight.
- Child who is not gaining weight or losing weight can be eating less or be a sick child
- Diseases like TB, AIDS and cancer cause weight loss.

## Organs and Systems

- Different organs doing different work are linked together as organ systems.
- Various systems do various tasks necessary for life
- Bones and muscles make the frame and walls. This also makes movement possible. Small and big, we have about 206 bones in the body of different shapes. About 100 bones are just in our hands and feet. The joints make movement possible.
- Human gut is about 22 ft long more than a room length. Gut is part of the digestive system and digests/absorbs food.
- Respiratory system provides us with oxygen by breathing air. Lungs inside our chest cavity helps us in inhalation and exhalation. Impure air is let out.
- We have about 5-6 liters of blood in our body.The heart keeps your blood pumping at all times as it picks up oxygen from your lungs and nutrients from digestive system and send them to different cells of body
- The blood carries nutrients and oxygen. It also picks up wastes from the organs. Blood works like trucks and wagons in the body, through the vessels.
- Urinary system throws away urine and cleanses the body. Skin also throws out sweat.
- Reproductive system is different in men and women. It helps in reproduction and continuation of life on earth.
- The eyes see, ears hear, nose smells, tongue tastes and skin gets touch, pressure, vibration and pain
- Human brain is most complex object in the world. We make necessary movement or change alertness.
- The Nervous system controls several body functions. Nerves act as electric wires to control all systems

### Mapping and learning more about our body

- Bony skeleton and attached muscles give body its basic frame.
- Skin covers all the body and protects it from outside environment.
- Soft organs are inside the chest and abdomen. Brain is inside the skull
- A butterfly like important gland (Thyroid) is present in front of the neck. Goitre is actually a swelling of this. Iodized salt prevents it
- The lungs inside the chest and fill like balloons. The wind pipe in the neck connects the nose throat to the lungs. It indeed looks like an upside down tree, the windpipe in the place of trunk.
- Fear or excitement speeds up the heart. Normally heart beats are 72-84 times
- Pipe like blood vessels connect the heart to rest of the body. These carry blood from heart to all parts.
- Blood is brought back to heart through veins
- Food pipe carries food and drinks to stomach in the middle of upper abdomen. Stomach stores and digests food for 1-2 hours
- A long coil of gut is in the middle of abdomen. This does further digestion. The long coils lead to a wider short pipe called colon. Colon is a bent pipe set against the abdomen wallsâ€“ going up from lower right side, and then becomes horizontal going left
- Liver is high up on the right side. A swollen liver can be felt below the lower right ribs
- Two kidneys are filters of blood making urine. They sit on the very back wall of abdomen. Urine from kidneys reaches urinary bladder through tubes
- Testes are hanging in a pouch to keep them cool. From the testes two thick cords carry sperms to two small bags close to urethra. They make semen carrying sperms. The semen is thrown out through urethra at the end of sexual intercourse.
- In women vagina is a passage from private parts to opening of uterus. Uterus â€“the womb-is a small purse with thick walls, hanging upside-down in the lower abdomen. It is protected by the pelvic bones.
- The womb grows in pregnancy with the growing baby inside. In pregnancy we can feel the womb on the abdomen.Two egg-tubes are attached to uterus on both sides.
- The tubes have free finger like ends. The fingers catch the eggs released from ovaries. The two ovaries flank the uterus.
- Outer parts of genitals are also different in men and women. In men testes are hanging in a pouch on each side. The urethra opens on the end of a long muscular penis.

## Women and Health

- Most women are anemic and weak. Their weights are too low to be healthy
- Infertility can result from health problems of either husband or wife. But usually it is the woman who gets the blame and mis-treated.
- Women bear all the trouble of childbirth, abortions. They also bear burden of preventing pregnancies
- If a woman gets daughters, she gets the blame again. In reality it all depends on the man's sperm
- Women's reproductive systems are more vulnerable for sexually transmitted infections
- Villages may have no air pollution, but that is not true for women. They work in kitchen smoke for 4-5 hrs everyday. It gives them coughs and headaches
- Let women also take part in making decisions in the family and village. They should
- participate in all meetings. This will make decisions wiser and more practical.
  - Discuss with men to share domestic work and child care.
  - Encourage Women to eat well and take enough rest.
  - Encourage girls to go to higher school and learn.
  - Try to stop physical or mental abuse of women.
  - Do not ignore women's health complaints.
  - Raise your boys and girls with equal respect and love.

## Organising A Group Meeting

- Get a group of 5-10 women/men (not more) in somebody's house. It is good to select a venue which is accessible to all especially women from scheduled castes/ tribes are comfortable
- You need to communicate to people in advance about the venue and timing of this meeting. You can also talk with members of self help group in the village.
- We can start about health hazard and problems due to openair defecation. Just provide the beginning or let someone begin
- Explain the basics of the sanitary latrine, and how one can make it
- Set up some ground rules in the beginning
- Let your audience participate in the discussions
- Do not open up topics which are ambiguous or difficult. You may not complete the topic in the same meeting
- Communication is effective if we follow our own advice at our home. People learn better with live example
- Do not underplay the complexity of the problem
- However in every community there are some innovators who are open to new ideas. You need to encourage them
