# Brief:

* Scope & Description: Underlying the pitting of institutional care against the “alternatives” of family and community-based care is the not-implicit assumption that the two are mutually exclusive, that one precludes the other: that institutions weaken familial and community ties, that funding institutional care drains resources from community-based initiatives. This paper problematizes such binary thinking through a case study of Sneha Care Home (SCH) – a care centre for CLHA which blends family and community-based initiatives with institutional care.

# Institutional Care:

* Policymakers across the globe are not very fond of institutional care homes. Their  various criticisms of institutions are that they are:
    * too expensive
    * too soulless
    * too cut-off
    * too de-humanizing 
* While it is recognized that institutional care may, sometimes, be in the best interests of some children, this is invariably presented as a last resort and “for the shortest possible duration.” 
* The over-all strategy remains firmly that of deinstitutionalization. This is especially the case given the belief that “(t)he very existence of institutions encourages families to place their children into care” and uses up funding that could otherwise go to alternative care 
* Private Boarding versus Institutional care:
    * One – and arguably the only contention in defence of this apparent double standard is that conditions in boarding schools are better than those in institutional care and that the harm and neglect that is potentially experienced by children within institutional care does not extend to borders. Yet evidence supporting this contention is conspicuous by its absence
    * Since there is little sound evidence to back up the claim that the boarding school system for the privileged is automatically and innately less harmful than institutional care for vulnerable children, perhaps the emphasis should be on the quality of care and education being provided to children in each rather than on where it is provided.
* Impact of institutional care on family relationships:
    * While it might be assumed that institutional placement would sever or weaken familial relations, evidence points to the positive effects that placing a family member in institutional care can have in terms of improving family ties and dynamics. In the case of the elderly, for example, it has been found that “nursing home placement leads to renewed or discovered closeness of familial bonds
    * Demonstrating institutional care’s potential long-term benefits for family dynamics was a longitudinal study which interviewed the families of children with mental retardation who had received residential treatment both one and two years after placement.
    * The study found that “respondents primarily reported post placement benefits to the family.” Crucially, however, the study also noted that in this particular case, family involvement in the children’s treatment programme while they were institutionalized was “high and stable.”
    * Indeed, a renowned longitudinal study carried out in the 1960s – “The Cleveland Bellefaire follow-up study” – found that for children leaving institutions and returning to their families and communities, the gains accrued from institutional care tended to last longer if staff worked with parents and community agents for a transitional period once the child was discharged
    * Lack of planned and nurtured contact between children in residential care and their families was found to be an almost universal phenomenon in the countries covered by Save the Children’s research. It is extremely rare to find any institution which positively values family contact


# Alternatives to Institutional Care: 



* These policymakers have found strong allies in a growing number of NGOs, children’s rights groups, social workers and academics.
* The result has been a proposed “hierarchy of alternatives [to institutional care] for children.” 
* Pride of place is reserved for living:
    * in the home of origin
    * followed by adoption
    * kinship foster care
    * long-term foster care in the home of a non-family member
    * care in an institution. 
    * “Permanency Planning” programmes – which aim to support families to care for children in their homes – have been introduced, “at least on a trial basis,” in almost every state
* Small group homes which are argued to be more personal than large institutions and guardianship are included as “subalternatives.”
* **UNICEF** has declared its support for programmes “including provision of information on the detrimental impact of institutional care on the young child, and education for parents of children with disabilities and parents at risk of abandoning their infants' ' to discourage the use of institutional care. 
* **Save The Children (STC)** encourages “[d]onors to ensure that funding is directed at preventive community and family support and at family-based alternative care.”
* “The new** international Guidelines** set out clear quality standards that should be met by all forms of alternative care. They are universal, based on the **UN Charter for the Rights of the Child (UNCRC,)** and apply to all settings regardless of their culture or financial and political status.”
* Amongst other things, these Guidelines set out to:
    * more effectively monitor existing institutions
    * provide better “gate-keeping”
    * restrict the use of institutional care especially for those under the age of three 
    * And importantly, place all of this within an overall strategy of deinstitutionalization.


# Assumptions pitting Institutional vs. the Alternatives 


* Institutional care and family/community care as being mutually exclusive:
    * This “care continuum” is a continuum in the sense that it presents an array of care options which fall across a spectrum but not in the sense that children are encouraged to move along it – since the goal is increasingly that of “permanency”, and within a family setting
    * This view is problematic for a number of reasons:
        * To “return” to the past form of care, as some advocates of alternative care seem to be espousing, would be to return to a “mixed-economy of care” – and not, as they suggest, family-based care
        * The second reason that the “either-or” approach is problematic is that by presenting family or community-based care as “alternatives” to institutional care, proponents of this view miss the point that historically, long-term institutional care facilities have spearheaded a number of the key healthcare initiatives (particularly to do with community outreach) that are now being presented as “alternatives” to those very institutions
        * The “either-or” assumption dismisses or at the very least underplays any possibility of combining elements of institutional care and the alternatives provided. In a similar fashion, the suggestion made in this paper is that SCH, which is intricately connected with Karnataka’s Community Care Centres on multiple levels: from family tracing to information sharing, from outreach services to follow-up care, demonstrates the extent to which it is possible to combine the benefits of both institutional care and community-based alternatives while offsetting a number of the disadvantages of each.
* Family and community-based care as the universally best options
    * Even the staunchest advocates of family-based care appreciate that this is not always possible – either because the child has been orphaned or because some biological parents for medical or other reasons are unable to care for their child. This is particularly true for CLHA, who are likely to have lost their parents to AIDS or have parent(s) with seriously compromised health – parent(s) who may not have long to live. 
    * For this reason, foster care or adoption are typically presented as viable alternatives to institutional care for these children to be able to be brought up in an environment which is as home-like as possible.
    * Adoption and Foster care in India:
        * Most relevant to the present study, the striking absence of foster care across India has been noted. 
        * Various reasons for why foster care has proven difficult to implement in India have been cited – but they include 
            * the difficulties of identifying foster carers with “appropriate motivation and adequate housing” 
            * and “problems of ‘matching’ children and foster carers around issues of caste, religion, colour and language.”  
        * Interestingly, work on child care in Cape Town, has also pointed to the dearth of formal foster care or adoption amongst the Indian community compared to the African community during the apartheid era -suggesting that this resistance to foster care may not be transient .
        * With the stigma surrounding HIV/ AIDS being so strong that many infected children are actually (unofficially) prevented from attending school in their communities owing to the fear of fellow students’ parents, the prospect of being fostered or adopted is an even more distant one for Indian CLHA.
    * The problem with Kinship care:
        * Kinship-based care has been proposed as an alternative to institutional care for orphaned children or children whose parents are unable to care for them. 
        * Indeed, because it involves blood ties and therefore, it is assumed, is based on a sense of familial loyalty and genuine affection, it is often presented as the preferred alternative over formal, non-kinship-based foster care or adoption
        * Yet this assumption can lead to a number of dangers. 
            * Evidence has been cited that it leads to less monitoring than formal fostering. For example, at SCH, one staff member recounted the case of one girl, formerly under the institution’s care, who was sold into sex slavery by her uncle. 
        * By appealing to our sense of family as a safe haven, kinship care appears innocuous, but, as this girl’s experience demonstrates, that is clearly not always the case  
        * As extended families are broken up, and as **financial pressures **make it difficult for people to sustain even their own nuclear families, one must question the extent to which even the most well-meaning extended kin can cope with the burden of taking in a niece, nephew or grandchild with multiple needs such as CLHA that may require even more financial and emotional investment than a healthy child.
        * For children with their kins working in agriculture and other daily wage work, kinship care would mean living in a mostly empty house, until aunts and uncles return home from a hard day’s work. 
        * The **current indian government scheme,** which gives 700 rupees a month to those caring for CLHA in their homes, can hardly be seen as an effective solution – since in the overwhelming majority of cases, the children’s extended kin are struggling even as the financial burden of caring for the ill child is carried completely by SCH.
        * Problems with grandparent care for vulnerable children: 
            * In ‘From Roots to Roots’, Tolfree reports research in Uganda which “found that behavioural problems were common in grandparent-headed households.” The study found that children who had a grandparent in their fifties and sixties as a caretaker were “vulnerable to malnutrition and infectious diseases because food production was low and medical care could not be afforded.
            * A US-based study “found that custodial grandparents have a 50% higher chance of having a daily activity limitation. They report lower satisfaction with their own health and rate their health status lower than do non-custodial grandparents
            * SCH runs an outreach programme in Kolar in collaboration with ‘Sisters of Precious Blood’ – a faith-based Community Care Centre. One nurse working in the outreach programme explained to this author that ART adherence is often more challenging when it comes to CLHA living in grandparent-headed households. The tendency for grandparents to forget, or to insist on giving children herbal medicines which interfere with the ART medication is a serious concern which she says she and the other staff members at ‘Sisters of Precious Blood’ often find themselves battling with.
* Community-based care and institutional care cater for the same populations:
    * Community-based organisations and social welfare agencies are seen as being able to provide support to the families (biological or otherwise) of vulnerable children while keeping the latter out of institutions. 
    * Yet here too, assuming that the “alternative” of community care targets the same populations that would otherwise have resided in institutions is problematic 
    * Social service “Creaming”:
        * The problem of “creaming” in social services remains a glaring one. As Schuerman has noted, “many programs appear to favour the acceptance of''better `` or''easier `` cases, cases that are relatively less needy.”
        * Targeted Intervention programs in India:
            * In the case of India, a look at how Targeted Intervention programs (TIs) for PLHA have fared is instructive. TIs have been one of the main mechanisms for reducing transmission of HIV across India under the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP-II). 
            * Statistics indicate that 2008 saw a significant decline in transmission rates amongst female sex workers in high HIV prevalence southern districts as compared to 2001 in places where TIs were intense. Yet a 2007 parliamentary committee report reveals that this is only part of the picture. 
            * As of 2007, 45% of sex workers, 47% of injecting drug users and a staggering 94% of men who have sex with men – all considered “target” vulnerable populations – had not received any intervention.
            *  Moreover, the committee noted that the Department of Health presented no figures for the Male Sex Worker population, suggesting that they either “do not have the figures of estimated coverage or they are simply not covered at all.” 
        * The idea that the acutely vulnerable can be equally and even better served by targeted social policies is challenged by these findings.
    * Weakened pubic voice:
        * One of the serious consequences of dismantling these kinds of pioneering institutions is the resulting fragmentation of vulnerable populations from a public voice point of view.
        * It has often been commented that one of the injustices of a democratic society is that even as it purports to provide everyone with a voice, it is repeatedly those most capable of organizing themselves effectively that are heard. 
        * The cruel irony being that those encountering serious barriers to that kind of organization (economic, educational, health related etc) – are likely to be those whose needs are most urgent 
    * Experience has shown that in a number of cases, the two cater for different types of populations – with those in institutional care typically exhibiting a plethora of problems that make their stay in a facility which can address those multiple needs the best option for them. 
    * The fact that community-based care and care in an institutional setting tend to target different populations makes the promotion of one over the other deeply problematic.
* Family (re)integration and community (re)integration as unproblematic concepts:
    * This is an important point since in almost all cases the stated goal of the “alternatives” agenda is that of “family reintegration” for the institutionalized whose biological families are alive or “family integration” for those put up for adoption, or who are entered into foster or kinship care. 
    * Community integration or reintegration is seen as flowing automatically once children are transferred from an institution to a family setting.
    * The documents appear to present the goals of family integration and successful community integration as synonymous. This is despite the worrying findings that a sizable number of children who are placed in foster care “age out” in the system and enter society woefully ill equipped for successful “community integration.”
    * The point is not to argue that institutional care prepares children for independent living while the proposed “alternatives” do not. Instead it is to say that the rigid goal of “family integration at all costs” does not ensure successful community integration and may in some cases positively discourage it. 
    * That is if “community integration” is understood to be an independent adult with the skills to build a life for him or herself wherever he or she chooses rather than simply being physically part of a community. 
    * Father Mathew at SCH points out that this apparent disjuncture between child and youth policy is particularly worrying in light of recent reports on the unemployability of the vast majority of Indian youth
    * Future-oriented policy and programs:
        * Whilst it has rightly been argued that child policy which sees the child as an ‘adult in waiting’ more than a ‘child in the here and now’ creates its own problems,53 few would deny the serious costs to both children and society – of creating short-sighted child policies – particularly for vulnerable children.
        * In an individual interview for the present study, father mathew described his long-term vision of establishing a mentorship programme, where individual donors who sponsor children’s material care while at SCH become a source of emotional, social and professional support throughout the child’s stay in the institutional setting as well as following discharge. The other goal is an alumni network of past SCH beneficiaries who, once discharged, may find it helpful to reach out to one another for various forms of support – much like university graduates entering a new phase of their lives.
        * **SCH’s “sibling programme**”, which was being discussed and planned at the time of this paper’s writing, is also considered key to this future-oriented approach. Fr Mathew maintains that linking the children at SCH to negative elder siblings – who are highly likely to outlive their parents – is one crucial way of ensuring some kind of long-term support for these children once they are discharged


# Blending Institutional and Community Care:

* The image of the institution as a segregating form of care, cutting members off from their communities and undermining their possibilities for forming meaningful social ties is not entirely unwarranted. 
* Staff members’ fear of what might happen to the vulnerable children under their care – which is born of their own disconnection from the children’s communities – leads to policies which further disconnect them and the children under their care from those communities. It is a vicious circle.
* Under India’s National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), over 300 (check) Community Care Centres (CCCs) were set up with the aim of providing community outreach and ensuring accessible support and health care for PLHA. 
* Most CCCs are faith-based – and their roles include providing medical care, forms of counselling, psychosocial, educational and nutritional support, linking individuals to ART centres and tracking drug adherence, among other things. Moreover, they help in day-to-day issues like ensuring vulnerable families have ration cards and access to the job market as well as providing vital outreach services for the community.
* Between 2006 and 2011, the USAID (United States Agency for International Development)Samastha programme became a catalyst for increasing the number of CCCs in Karnataka (there were previously ten). The role of the Sneha Care Team within this programme was that of a mentor, offering a supportive role to the Centres.

## Practices used by Sneha Care Home:
- Once a child is accepted into SCH, working with NGOs – mainly their counsellors, outreach workers and project coordinators enables the Sneha Care Team to cultivate a vital link between the institution and the child’s community. 
- For starters, NGOs are an integral component of SCH’s “Keep the Parents Alive” policy, which supports parents of the CLHA under its care. SCH checks up on the health situation of positive parents by keeping in touch with NGOs and on a number of occasions itself refers parents to NGOs when concerns about their health or socioeconomic well-being arise.
- It was insisted at various points that the purpose of these visits is less to “check up” on the child than to provide its staff members with an insight into the child’s background. To date, SCH staff members have jointly managed to cover 80 percent of children’s PCGs’ homes. Staff members typically spend a maximum of thirty minutes in each house, though there is no set time. 
- The idea is to collect basic data, including an assessment of PCGs’ economic situation and to get a feel of the children’s backgrounds and communities. Home visits were also introduced with the aim of linking children to NGOs if no prior connection existed and identifying secondary caregivers for children.
- All the one hundred children currently at SCH were brought to the institution’s attention by Community Care Centres (CCCs), NGOs, PLHIV Networks (hereafter jointly referred to as NGOs) or by primary caregivers themselve
- That socioeconomic factors and the desire to provide their children with an education are primary motivations for the child’s enrolment in SCH is indicated by PCGs’ own written accounts in a number of information gathering exercises carried out by SCH as well as SCH staff members in individual interviews.
- Caring for CLHA is made more complicated still since in a number of places across India, enrolment in a community-based school is difficult for CLHA due to stigma. Misinformation fuels fears among fellow students’ parents that studying with a CLHA will put their own child at risk, often providing an effective barrier to education for this population
- This is since many of the children are brought forward for admission through NGOs that seek out “the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children among the infected children in the area.” 73 Moreover, the Home’s policy is that “preference will be given to orphans,” and that “children of single parents and children living with parents will be considered only after assessing the family condition...”

### Role of Primary Caregivers (PCGs):
- It should be noted at the outset that “primary caregiver” is the technical term used by SCH to refer to the person – outside of SCH staff who is primarily responsible for any major decisions regarding the child. The primary caregiver is responsible for decisions like the child’s enrolment in SCH (subject to SCH acceptance) and discharge. The primary caregiver is also responsible for phoning and visiting the child and taking the child home for holiday(s). 
- Unless the point calls for specification as to whether a parent, extended kin or an non-relative entrusted with the child’s care is being referred to, the “PCG” (primary caregiver) will be used, and should be taken to mean any of these three.
- Certainly, SCH’s “Keep the parents alive” policy – which networks with NGOs to ensure infected parents of the children under its care receive adequate medical care and supervision is a form of “empowering
- “Teaching” PCGs did not preclude the latter’s possibilities for empowered caregiving, indeed it positively facilitated it. In their interviews, SCH staff members maintained that their links with NGOs help to promote as far as possible, benefits such as access to ration cards and employment for a number of the family members of children under their care.


### Measures used at SCH [[Assessment Tools]]
- Evaluation Questionnaire for CLHIV:
	- The below are questions from the “Evaluation Questionnaire for CLHIV” selected for their relevance to family involvement] 
		- Programmatic Knowledge
			- Why didn’t you join in your local school while your brother/ sister/ neighbours joined there? 
            * Family 
                * What did your parents/ relative/ guardian tell you regarding your health? 
                * What did your parents tell you about admission in this school? 
                * After holidays we had an evaluation to see how you were at home. Why did we conduct that? 
                * Did you experience any discrimination at home at any level? 
            * General 5
                * Have you noticed that many children don’t have parents here? What do you think about it?
        * The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ):
            * The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a brief behavioural screening questionnaire about 3-16 year olds. 
            * It was administered along with Rutter questionnaires to parents and teachers of children drawn from psychiatric clinics. 
            * A focus on strengths as well as difficulties; better coverage of inattention, peer relationships and prosocial behaviour are its salient features.
    * Procedures involved in children’s care at SCH:
        * All such procedures have been recorded in a manual, therefore all cases of PCG involvement that appear in the manual have been extracted and listed below. They have been grouped under one of five headings based on the nature of involvement they denote. 
    
		    ## The five headings are: 
            * Data gathering 
                * That is simply gathering information about the child’s family background from the PCGs themselves or otherwise.
                * When a child is admitted to SCH, family details and some information pertaining to the child is collected from the parents, family member or guardian of the child.
                * Later, according to a structured format, the child’s initial information is tracked. In the same way, the counselling department meets the kids on an individual basis and collects complete information from the child as well as parents or guardians on their visit to SCH. The elaborative profiles are also documented in a structured format.
                * It might be hypothesized that data gathering which involves placing staff members in families’/ PCGs’ environments in a non-threatening manner might have particular benefits for staff sensitization that cannot be gained from traditional form-filling methods of data collection
            * Opportunities for contact between child and PCG
                * During the time of admission, the families are clearly informed about their contact with the child through phone calls and family visits. 
                * These connections are made so that the child does not feel she/ he is abandoned by the family and made clear to the child it is for a purpose that he/ she lives here. 
                * Phone calls are requested to be made at least once weekly, timing between 8pm and 9pm on weekdays and 9am to 9pm on Sundays
                * Family visits to the centre are encouraged if they can afford the travelling expenses. When they visit they are asked to sign the visitor’s book in order to keep record of the person who visited and their frequency of visit. 
                * During their visits they are requested to bring a handful of snacks not bulk snacks as upsetting for those whose parents do not visit them often.
            * Opportunities for contact between SCH staff and PCG
                * Outgoing calls are made for: 
                    * Children who do not receive the calls at least once in a month and an enquiry is made for the reason of not making the call; 
                    * Children who ask for a phone call if have not received for two weeks; 
                    * For behavioural concerns; 
                    * Every month the families are being communicated with about the child’s positive behavioural change; 
                    * During birthdays if the child has not received a call
            * Opportunities for feedback from PCG (whether of a decision-making kind or otherwise)
                * The SDQ is administered along with the Rutters questionnaire.
                * Feedback from parents/ guardians is gathered at the drop-in time of the child to the centre after holidays. 
                * Post holiday assessment with the family is done so as to scrutinize the versions given by the child and the family [child also provides feedback]. 
                * In case the child is brought through by another person, the feedback is gathered through a phone call.
            * Opportunities for direct involvement of PCG in child’s care:
                * The following statement is included in the consent form primary caregivers have to sign upon the child’s admission into SCH:
                    * “I also agree that the child would be sent home during the holidays and it would be my responsibility to take the child home and bring the child back to the centre.”
    * Empowering to partnering: 
        * Rather than “empowering” family members, the focus, Fr Mathew insists, might be more usefully shifted to “partnering” with them. The importance of institutions involving family members as active partners in the care process has been recognized in the case of Alzheimer’s patients.In practice, developing a partnership with family members would mean drawing on the extensive knowledge and insight of the family member and creating an inviting atmosphere for them to visit. 
    * Sibling connection:
        * SCH Social Care Department staff indicated to this author that sibling contact is encouraged and that staff members regularly make contact with children’s siblings as the latter do not tend to make phone calls to children at SCH without this push from the staff’s end.
        * Concerns related to siblings:
            * A UNICEF study on barriers to services faced by this population found that in Karnataka, affected children are frequently victims of exclusion within their communities. 
            * At school many face “mistreatment by teachers... are made to sit separately, [and] get less attention than their classmates,” amongst other things. The study also found that “some schools bow to public pressure to refuse admission to affected children.” 
            * In Karnataka specifically the children interviewed for the study “referred to the impoverishment of their families due to HIV/ AIDS.” The study also found that many affected children face barriers to even routine medical services or are denied them altogether because “it is assumed they are HIV positive.” 
            * In Nagaland and Maharashtra, affected children reported barriers to food aid or subsidised food stuffs. Moreover, there is evidence that affected girls may be especially badly hit. While orphanhood is debilitating for both boys and girls, the tendency for girls to assume more of the domestic responsibilities means affected girls’ education is likely to suffer.
            * Perhaps unsurprisingly given such obstacles, one study found that HIV positive parents reported an “elevated level of behavioural symptoms in [their] HIV-affected children.” 
            * As poverty is strongly correlated with HIV/ AIDS, it has been noted that affected children face an increased risk of becoming destitute, getting involved in criminal activity and are especially vulnerable to sexual exploitation and other forms of abuse
        
	## The Kolar Outreach Programme: Bringing the community to the institution
    * In 2011 SCH established an outreach programme in the Kolar district in conjunction with the SCH-owned CCC ‘Sisters of Precious Blood.’ SCH’s stated aim for setting up this outreach programme was to address the complex needs of some of the community-based siblings of the children under its care and to provide services for other infected and affected children within the community. 
    * Drug adherence and medical support is a fundamental part of the programme – since it was only through the SCH-owned CCC ‘Sisters of Precious Blood’ that a section of the district hospital was developed to cater for the needs of CLHA.
    * Yet the stated rationale behind the programme is that national services for CLHA focus overwhelmingly on their medical care – meaning that issues such as their education, eventual employment and the successful negotiation of adulthood are treated as secondary or not addressed at all. It is these areas which the outreach programme is particularly geared toward,
    * Beyond that, the stated goal of SCH is to “accompany these children in their journey towards the future.”
    * The Kolar initiative is one powerful example of how institutions can use their expertise to develop outreach programmes that identify and address service gaps in community-based care
