**14-Feb, 2022:**

**Readings:** [*Global Childhood Report
2021*](https://www.savethechildren.org/content/dam/usa/reports/advocacy/2021-global-childhood-report.pdf)

- Need to read more on comparison of different countries’ approach to childcare, budget allocation, nationally driven child care programmes etc.

- **The End of Childhood Index** compares data across 186 out of 197 countries in the world.

-   The US is at least 25 points behind most western European countries & is similar in scores to Bahrain, China, Montenegro, Qatar, Russia and Slovakia. A point raised is to also take into account the child population in these countries to make sense of this index.

-   Where to log research agencies website for further reference:[*https://childmortality.org/*](https://childmortality.org/). Resolved: Add this to the [*sheet*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GRiS7QFPiak-1Ob3TdobKnaHqgUBb_8B-fErHP1BXUA/edit#gid=1763607082).

-   Where to log assessment tools we come across: [*WHO Child Growth Standards*](https://www.who.int/tools/child-growth-standards)

-   Where does reporting readings like - UNICEF The State of the World’s Children go? Resolved: added this to the [*sheet*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GRiS7QFPiak-1Ob3TdobKnaHqgUBb_8B-fErHP1BXUA/edit#gid=1763607082).

**Readings:**

-   [*Working with children Sensitively by Prerana*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bekMgzxuqvFW41SEUwrSsa5Bv4Dctx3XcvY-q46rW8w/edit?usp=sharing) - 10 pages

-   Restoration Model - 61 pages

-   Prerana’s guide on **‘working sensitively with children’** is a good yet simple guide for caregiver training on how toapproach children. A decent training to give CCI staff – as is.Maybe the whole guide can be turned into a visual animation (video) of each scenario to help remember it easier.

-   One of the SMEs we’ll need are animators. To make videos. Would a key function of the v1 of the course / modules be conversion of existing training into easier / accessible format? What kind of license / permission do we need to get from orgs like Prerana to recreate their content?

-   Actual people acting might resonate more with caregivers than animation. Are there studies on the effectiveness of different modes of video content for training? Orgs like Upgrad would have a research team that would know this – how to get in touch with them?

-   Studies on LGBTQ work with children in institutional care

-   Which are world famous **parenting books**? Can we incorporate caregiver training from techniques given in such books / research?

-   Research on the topic of dealing with sexual exploration among adolescents & as caregivers, what to keep in mind to encourage healthy sexuality

**8-Feb, 2022:**

**Reading**: Budget for Children Analysis 22-23 - 21 pages

-   Read up on all 159 programmes / schemes related to children

-   ICPS was merged under Mission Vatsalya. Received 63.57% increase in allocation but in terms of absolute numbers it is less than 1500 crore of the previous year.

-   ICPS itself has only INR 900 Crore allocated against INR 1500 Cr of the previous year since got clubbed under Mission Vatsalya – which itself received a tad lesser than 1500 Cr.

-   Learn more about **World Vision’s Child Wellbeing Report** - the metrics they measure, how they do this survey etc.

-   Look up Aide et Action - they studied Covid-19 impact on migrant children

-   Can we align nutritional outcome indicators with national child health tracking indicators or any standardized national level benchmarking system? Refer to some of the studies referenced in the HAQ’s budget doc as a starting point to do more reading. Eg.Anaemia Mukt Bharat Scorecard

**7-Feb, 2022: **

**Reading:** Mental Health in Child Care Institutions during Covid by
Prerana - 10 pages

-   Prerana’s article on impact of Covid-19 on mental health of children - recommends to limit digital access - why is this? Is there more research done on what is the ideal screen time that’s okay for children of different ages?

-   Prerana’s Anti-trafficking Centre seems to have guides for certain topics like Mental Health that could be used as a starting point for training module creation or it could be circulated for expert opinion etc. Mental health of caregivers is a topic to be researched more & identify if there are SMEs who have done work on this. It could be a crucial piece in CAP.

-   The pandemic’s impact on children with special needs was a point in the doc – that distress could cause them to decline in their progress. Eg. if they could put buttons on their own, they wouldn’t be able to etc. While they cannot express their distress, they manifest as this.

**Reading:** Institutional Care Model by Prerana - 67 pages

-   Marronage - the process of extricating oneself from slavery

-   Prerana to be added to the Practitioners list on Obsidian.

-   The Financial / budgeting component is missing in Prerana’s Institutional Care Model.

-   Rainbow’s Care Mgmt module seems to be more templates / framework oriented looking at their details of the different registers and books maintained etc.

-   Prerana hasn’t talked about **‘family like care**’ or forming smaller groups within the CCI etc while Udayan Care seems to -probably because their CCIs function more as group homes.

-   Getting a legal / compliance specialist to get CCI’s registration process could be required since there’s a renewal needed every 5 years for which several documents about their governance, last 3 years balance sheet etc is required. \#compliance

-   What is a **healthy separation** (based on age / background etc) and a **healthy integration** to be maintained between children in a CCI?

-   CCI Response if sexual abuse of child within the CCI - Prerana is quiet about this in their institutional care model, Udayan care overs this topic in some detail but not enough I think.

-   Does Rule 39 require DCPO to be the chairperson of every CCI’s management committee? Is this given for Govt homes only? Found in Udayan Care notes.

**Reading:** Institutional Care Model by Prerana - 67 pages

After Prerana’s institutional care model reading:

-   Their medical examination / camps etc is a good reference point

-   Their focus on personnel management, daily rounds, review systems etc looks good

-   The aftercare / reintegration of children who are victims of sexual abuse is particularly complex given the abuse / sex offender / trafficker could come back and harrass / cause violence / acid attack etc. victims / families of victims move villages / towns to avoid such issues. Some children don’t want to leave the institution because of such issues

-   Proving the age of the sexual abuse victim is crucial – as if they’re minors they get CCI protection and if not, they’re moved to those womens’ homes - where it is not monitored as closely as CCIs.

-   They use ASER tool at the time of admission to assess the educational level of children – and place them in schools / bridge course accordingly. Get more information on how they do this, its effectiveness and why they chose this tool.

-   Their segment on social protection & welfare talks about getting legal documentation for their children. Worth talking to them about how they’ve gone about it and how much success they’ve had in streamlining the process for their children. They have covered details about age verification medical examination (AVM exam). Since Maharashtra has the orphan certificate - need to understand how much that’s come in handy etc. Read up the case study on ascertaining the age of a rescued victim.

-   Their points on the legal aspects of children who are victims of child sexual abuse or trafficking is quite detailed, with certain best practices on how to go about court trials, what the process looks like and how to protect the child from being re-traumatized etc.

-   Overall paper is a much more comprehensive visual of the management of the CCI - specifically from the care services point of view (perhaps because they deal with children who’ve gone through acute trauma). It’s a good read to get a flavour of the nuances / complexities of running a CCI.

-   Health section doesn’t cover the exact meal plan or a sample.
