# Brief:

- Scope & Description: This study highlights that stable placement within family care for children who experience adversity in early life is essential to ensure the best outcomes for physical development. This was a randomized controlled trial of 114 institutionalized. Children were followed from baseline (21 months, range 5–31) through age 12 years for caregiving disruptions and growth trajectories and through age 14 years for pubertal development to determine the effects of foster care vs institutional care, as well as disruptions in the caregiving environment on physical development through early adolescence.

# Physical development in institutionalised vs. foster care children:

- Profound growth failure is a hallmark of institutional care in early childhood. The current study demonstrates that a small number of caregiving disruptions within foster care, which adults may view as trivial and even routine, can have significant additional effects on child wellbeing. The stress of having to accommodate changing care environments alters normal developmental processes and changes outcome for the worse.

## Height & Weight:
- Compared with the institutionalized group, the foster care group showed greater rates of growth for height, weight, and BMI from baseline to age 12 years.
  - Increasing disruptions in the caregiving environment were related to decreasing rates of growth in height in foster care group and weight in institutionalized group and foster care group, but not BMI.
  - Aside from group differences in growth, the compromised height and weight growth patterns linked to individual differences in caregiver disruptions in foster care group underscore the importance of a consistent caregiving environment for child well-being.

## Occipital frontal circumference (OFC):

  - Despite placement in a more stable, nurturing, and stimulating environment, head circumference, a surrogate for brain size, did not significantly improve in foster care group between baseline and 12 years.
  - No group difference in the growth rate of head circumference z scores emerged between baseline and age 12 years
  - Increasing disruptions in the caregiving environment were not related to decreasing rates of growth of head circumference.
  - This result is consistent with a meta-analysis that identified head circumference as the growth parameter least likely to improve among postinternationally adopted children.
  
## Pubertal development: [[Child Development]]

  - Tanner development was delayed in institutionalized group boys compared with foster care group and family care group boys at 12 but not 14 years. Institutionalized group boys showed lower Tanner scores compared with foster care group and family care group 
  - Disruptions from 30 months to 12 years of age were greater in institutionalized group; vs foster care group 
  - There were no differences in Tanner development and age of menarche among foster care group, institutionalized group, and family care group girls at ages 12 and 14 years.
  - Our findings suggest that altered patterns of pubertal development were linked to both number of caregiving disruptions and the child'sex.
  - Tanner development in boys and girls was differentially influenced by caregiving disruptions. This finding extends the number of sex-related differences in the response to adversity or the foster care intervention documented in BEIP.
    - Boys in institutionalized group with 2 caregiving disruptions had lower mean Tanner scores at 12 years of age vs institutionalized group and foster care group boys with disruptions.
    - Girls in foster care group who experienced 2 caregiving disruptions had greater mean Tanner scores at 14 years of age than foster care group girls experiencing caregiving disruptions.
  - Thus, although we did not observe major changes in pubertal development among groups, caregiving disruptions deserve further investigation as a factor that could moderate changes in pubertal tempo in girls and boys.
  - **Romanian study** : A previous survey of pubertal development in children experiencing severe deprivation within Romanian orphanages revealed that the onset of puberty was delayed by approximately 2.5 years in girls and 1.5 years in boys. In contrast, in children adopted out of adverse environments such as institutional or foster care, many, though not all studies, have documented a higher rate of early pubertal development particularly in girls.
  - **Denmark study** : In a longitudinal study of 276 internationally adopted girls to Denmark, the normal probability curves for breast development and menarche were similar in shape to those of typically developing Danish girls but were displaced 1.3 years earlier for both breast development and menarche. Consequently, 16% entered puberty prior to 8 years of age and approximately the same percentage experienced menarche prior to 11 years of age. In that Danish cohort, an early but otherwise normal rise in pituitary and ovarian hormones that predated external signs of sexual maturation suggested that this early pubertal development is centrally driven through early activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.
  - **United Kingdom study** : Earlier pubertal development has also been observed in Romanian children placed in adoptive families in the United Kingdom. In that study, a combined group of boys and girls who had spent 6 months within institutional care prior to adoption had greater summated Tanner scores at age 11 years than the comparison group consisting of within UK adoptees and Romanian adoptees spending 6 months within institutional care.
  - Despite expectations of altered pubertal tempo, the only difference noted was that Tanner scores at age 12 years in institutionalized group boys were lower compared with both foster care group and family care group boys. Tanner development and age of menarche were comparable among girls in institutionalized group, foster care group, and family care group.
  - A shift to earlier Tanner development or age of menarche seen in the Danish study was not observed in foster care group girls. Neither was puberty delayed in institutionalized group girls as previously described.

# Tools used to measure physical development:

## Body-Mass Index:

  - Growth was assessed in institutionalized group and foster care group at baseline , 30 months, 42 months, 8 years, and 12 years.
  - supine length  or height, weight, weight-for-length/height (baseline, 30 months henceforth included in the term BMI), and BMI (42 months and 8 and 12 years) were converted to age and sex standardized scores (z scores) based on Center for Disease Control 2000 data.

## Occipital frontal circumference z scores:

  - Occipital frontal circumference (OFC) z scores were calculated using the standardized data (0–18 years of age) of Roche et al.
-
## Tanner stages:

  - Participants were given the option to complete a self-report puberty assessment scale at ages 12 and 14 years.
  - Participants were shown a series of pictures depicting different Tanner stages of physical development in breasts/ genitalia, and pubic hair and asked to circle the picture that best resembled their current appearance.

# Limitations of the study:

- First, despite the fact that data on growth and testosterone levels varied in the expected direction with Tanner scores at 12 years of age, a shortcoming is the use of a self-administered Tanner assessment tool. Though considered reliable and necessary in the current situation because of the vulnerable nature of our sample, self-assessment never quite attains the accuracy of direct examination by trained observers.
- Second, implicit in the assumption that we might observe earlier or later pubertal development was that our subjects and previously reported adopted or institutionalized children experienced similar adverse environments. Late pubertal development was described in children experiencing a lifetime of severe adversity in the worst Romanian orphanages during and immediately after the Ceausescu era. Although children in the institutionalized group did not experience the same quality of family care as the foster care group neither did they experience the unspeakable conditions endured by the previously reported cohort.
- Third, adversity in early life encompasses many domains and the present study was designed to examine only a limited number of variables that could potentially impact physical development. Taking into account the presence and magnitude of additional adverse experiences in the groups is difficult if not impossible.
- Finally, because of decisions over time by Romanian child protection officials, many children originally randomized to institutionalized groups found placement within family care. Because all analyses we reported are based on the children's original group assignments, the movement of higher risk children to more nurturing environments may moderate or obscure differences in outcomes between foster care group and institutionalized group.
- Because of these limitations, we recommend caution about generalizing our results to other groups of children experiencing adversity in early life.
