# Brief:

* Scope & Description: This paper aims to highlight the diversity of the educational pathways taken by people with care experience and provide insight into some of the events and experiences that have influenced these pathways by drawing on data collected as part of a qualitative life course study of the educational pathways of care-experienced adults aged 24 to 36 in Ireland.

# Life course perspective on educational pathways

* The life course perspective is an interdisciplinary framework for understanding human development from birth to death (Mayer, 2009).
* Several principles (for example human agency and the timing of lives) and concepts (for example transitions and turning points) are central to the life course perspective (Hutchison, 2005). Together these principles and concepts address a varied and multidimensional range of factors that shape human development over time providing a unique insight into the nuances of development.
* Roksa and Velez (2012) note that education is a ‘process’ that occurs over time, regularly becoming entwined with other transitions and events in the life course pointing to the value of taking a long-term view of experiences.


## Diversity in educational pathways

* The life course perspective has evolved to include the theme of ‘diversity in life course trajectories’ (Elder Jr, 1998; Shanahan, 2000). This theme acknowledges that there is considerable diversity in life course trajectories due to a range of factors including cohort variations, social class, gender, culture, and individual agency (Hutchison, 2011).
* The life course perspective, and the accompanying principle of diversity in life course trajectories/ pathways, provides a framework for conceptualising this potential diversity in the context of the educational pathways of adults with care experience.


# Educational pathways in the general population

* Existing literature indicates that in the general population while many people progress to post-compulsory education straight after they finish their compulsory schooling, many also take different and delayed routes into further and higher education at different times in their lives (Bozick & DeLuca, 2005; Roksa & Velez, 2012).
* Meiners (2018) notes that among working students, when multiple roles are held, these are not independent of each other and negotiation is required between roles; arguably this is also the case for other roles such as ‘parent’ or ‘carer’. While negotiating this balance can be difficult, Meiners (2018) adds that enrichment in one role can have benefits for other roles.
* Schoon and Duckworth (2010: 283) observe that early school leaving is often associated with relatively “poor adult outcomes” such as low income and poor mental health while also noting that some people who leave school early do “find continuous employment and achieve financial independence”.
* Drawing on two British Birth Cohort studies (1958 and 1970), Schoon and Duckworth (2010) examined factors associated with a successful transition for early school leavers by the age of 34. School motivation and positive attitudes to learning were identified as important. Guided by a life course perspective the authors also considered macro issues (for example the economic impact of recession) and point to the importance of having “structured education and employment pathways and policies for young people from relative disadvantaged backgrounds” (p. 291).


# Educational pathways of people with care experience
* Existing research with young care leavers has shown that, when it comes to their educational pathways, former children in care tend to experience delayed progressions through education in comparison with their peers (Driscoll, 2013; Jackson & Cameron, 2012; Montserrat, Casas, & Malo, 2013).
* The more recent YiPPEE study3 investigated the educational pathways of care leavers aged 18–24 after the end of compulsory schooling in five European countries England, Denmark, Sweden, Spain, and Hungary (Cameron, Hollingworth, & Jackson, 2011; Jackson & Cameron, 2012).
* The authors identified five ‘typical’ educational pathways travelled by young people:
* Those who progressed through school in line with their peers on the academic route 
* Those who pursued the academic route but with a delay (i.e. repeating years, retaking courses of study, starting university later than normal) 
* Those taking a vocational pathway leading to study at college or university or work-based training 
* Those taking short-cycle vocational training 5. Those on ‘yo-yo’ pathways: Young people in this group were enrolled and dropped out of courses and had frequent changes of direction (Jackson & Cameron, 2012).
* In Hungary, where young people leaving care can avail of aftercare support up to the age of 25 if they are engaged in post-secondary education on a full-time basis, findings from the YiPPEE study indicate four educational pathways taken by young people leaving care with two leading to higher education and two to obtaining vocational qualifications (Rácz & Korintus, 2013).
* While the pathways identified in the above studies provide valuable insights, we suggest that examining the educational pathways of people with care experience would benefit from a more long-term perspective drawing on the views and experiences of ‘older’ care leavers in order to examine the extent of any ‘delay’ as well as those factors that have shaped and influenced the educational pathways of care-experienced adults.
* Mendis (2015, Mendis et al., 2018) reports the findings of a qualitative study of the experiences of 18 women university graduates in Australia now aged 25–65 who had spent at least three years in care. The author identified five groups according to their educational experiences: Destined, Decided, Determined, Denied, or Delayed. 
* The author reports the experiences of the women in each group from those in the Destined group who received assistance and resources towards their education through to those in the Delayed group who had a negative experience of school all the way through contributing to poor performance and challenging behaviour while at school. Members of the Delayed group realised the value of education later in life and decided to remedy their earlier lack of qualifications.
* In a more recent paper, Harrison (2019) synthesises three English datasets to map participation in higher education among care-experienced young people. Among the findings of this study, Harrison (2019) reports that care-experienced students pursuing higher education as identified in this study, are, on average, older than other students and many have returned to education following a considerable gap. Many also pursue Higher Education later via further education adult/work-based education.


## The value of a longer-term perspective

* While the perception is that it is the norm to pursue further and higher education immediately after completing compulsory schooling, evidence from the wider literature on education suggests that many people in the general population delay or postpone entry. From the perspective of young people leaving care, for many, perhaps it makes sense to postpone entry to further and higher education to manage more immediate matters such as finding somewhere to live and managing finances.
* Bengtsson and colleagues (2018) point to this potential early focus for young people leaving care. The authors report findings from a small-scale Swedish qualitative longitudinal study of 15 care leavers' (aged 16 to 21) expectations of the future. Participant short-term expectations were primarily focused on their worries in relation to leaving care and how they would cope upon leaving care with the challenges of life. Long-term expectations however, were quite different and reflected positive expectations about their futures suggesting that, in the case of this study at least, young people anticipated difficult times ahead in the short-term but were optimistic and hopeful about their long-term experiences.


# Methods

* This study was completed using qualitative methods. Prior to recruitment and data collection taking place the study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the [School of Social Work and Social Policy, Trinity College Dublin.].
* Eighteen adults with care experience were recruited to participate in this study. The following criteria were used to recruit participants: 1) spent a minimum of two years in care as a child in Ireland at any age. Given the exploratory nature of this study we did not specify the age at which time in care had to have occurred for example, during adolescence; 2) were currently aged 25–35.
* Educational life history interviews (Moore, 2006) were conducted with all 18 participants in a location of their choice.
* When participants had finished telling their story the first author asked a range of follow-up questions drawing on her knowledge of the topic literature and to probe issues participants had raised in their initial narrative.
* All interviews were transcribed verbatim by the first author and all participants were allocated a pseudonym during the transcription process. All other identifying information (e.g. areas participants lived, school names) were also anonymised.


# Findings

* The average age of participants was 29 with a range of 24 to 36. Eleven participants were female and seven were male. Participants had spent between two years and 18 years in care. Six participants had been in foster care only, and six residential care only. A further six had been in both residential and foster care.
* There was considerable diversity in the number of placements participants had been in from one to over 21 with two participants noting that they did not know how many placements they had had altogether but that it was over 20 for one, and over 21 for the other.
* In terms of education, the average age when participants left school was 18 with five leaving school between the ages of 14 and 16.
* Four ‘types’ of educational pathways taken by participants were identified following data analysis:
	* Typical Pathway 
	* Typical Pathway ‘plus’ 
	* Short-term Disrupted Pathway 
	* Long-term Disrupted Pathway
* The four pathways focus on the latter stages of participant education, primarily secondary education, post-compulsory education, current ‘outcome’, and plans for the future. Pathways one and two – the ‘typical’ groups reflect typical pathways in education taken by those in the majority population. Pathways three and four reflect alternative pathways that were ‘disrupted’ and involved delays and detours as a result of various experiences in participant lives.


## Pathway 1: typical pathway



* Participants who had taken this pathway completed their compulsory education ‘on time’ and went on to pursue undergraduate degrees straight after completing their compulsory education.
* While all three participants in this group took a ‘typical’ pathway 4 In the Irish context, children generally attend primary school from approximately age five to age 12 and secondary school from age 12 to age 18. 5 Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) courses are full-time and last for one to two years. 
* They offer a mixture of practical work, academic work and work experience (Citizens Information, 2018). 5 from secondary to higher education, they had notably different early school and home experiences. One participant was in the same longterm placement from infancy, one came into care aged eight after chaotic early years with her birth family, and the other came into care aged 15.
* All three participants in this group were exposed to high expectations and positive attitudes towards education at varying points in their educational pathway. By the time they reached their early twenties, all three participants who took this pathway had completed undergraduate degrees


## Pathway 2: typical pathway ‘plus’



* Participants on this pathway had all successfully pursued higher education in the years after they left school. For participants in this group this progression involved completion of a one-year further education course prior to entering higher education.
* All three found themselves struggling in different ways towards the end of secondary school and this manifested itself in skipping school, worrying about support after they left care, and acting out.
* Leaving Certificate exam, all three reported not achieving high grades and opted to pursue a Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) course as a next step.
* Two participants in this group commented on the support they received from their foster carers, feeling that they had a ‘safety net’ to fall back on if things did not work out when it came to their education. This was invaluable in terms of enabling them to take risks.


## Pathway 3: short-term disrupted pathway



* Participants on this pathway had taken a period of time out of education in their teenage years before returning to further and/or higher education in their late teens or early 20s.
* All participants in this group spent the years after leaving secondary education in a range of contexts and roles. For some the time was spent working and pursuing short-term courses or caring for their young babies while others experienced addiction and homelessness.
* Returning to education was prompted by various factors including the possibility of gaining financial support for pursuing education, a concern regarding losing financial support related to aftercare, consistent and regular encouragement of extended family, wanting to prove those who doubted them wrong, and wanting to provide for young children.
* Some completed several PLC courses before entering an undergraduate degree programme. All participants in this group had commenced an undergraduate degree by their early 20s. One participant was pursuing a further education qualification and hoped to complete her undergraduate degree in the future.


## Pathway 4: long-term disrupted pathway



* Participants on this pathway had taken an extended break from education before returning, or planning to return, to further or higher education.
* Six participants had taken this pathway. While some in this group had had chaotic and highly disjointed school and placement experiences, one had had a highly stable placement and educational experience.
* In the years between their secondary education and their most recent return – or planned return – to further and/or higher education participants, had been engaged in diverse activities including working in various sectors (for example, retail, the hospitality industry, and the voluntary sector), learning a trade, experiencing homelessness, parenting, and caring for birth parents reflecting various life experiences.
* The length of time spent away from education ranged from three to over 10 years. Some participants in this group clearly stated that they had not felt ready to pursue further or higher education until their late twenties.


# Discussion



* In the case of the 18 adults interviewed for this study, the pursuit of post-compulsory education occurred in different ways and within different timeframes. The pursuit of education is not always a linear endeavour (Davey & Jamieson, 2003; Feinstein & Peck, 2008).
* The alternative disrupted pathways identified in this paper resonate with some of those identified in previous studies, for example in the YiPPEE study (Jackson & Cameron, 2012) and Harrison's (2017) recent work in England. Many participants in this study pursued higher education via ‘PLC’ courses echoing Harrison's (2019) finding that many care-experienced young people in England pursued pathways into higher education via further education and adult education courses.
* It is important to note the higher numbers of participants who had taken “alternative, ‘disrupted’ educational pathways in what could ultimately be considered a predominantly ‘successful’ group as most had completed or were pursuing undergraduate degrees and/or further education qualifications at the time of interview. This would suggest that delays in educational pathways may be the norm for this group of care-experienced adults.
* While the early school leavers in this study sample “bucked the trend” and returned to further and higher education (Davey & Jamieson, 2003: 266), this may not be the case for all people with care experience who leave school early.
* A range of factors related to family and structural issues influenced participant pathways including family and school culture, support from carers, financial support available, and the role of work and family life.
* These findings resonate with both the life course perspective's conceptualisation of individual and structural factors influencing diversity in pathways (Hutchison, 2011) as well as existing evidence that suggests that when compared to students who pursue post-compulsory education “on-time” students who delay the pursuit of further and higher education may have transitioned to other roles prior to re-entering the world of education (Roksa & Velez, 2012).
* Study findings resonate further with evidence from the wider education literature on progression to post-compulsory pathways. While some participants did progress to post-compulsory education immediately after their compulsory education (those in the Typical Pathways), others took different routes into further and higher education (those in the Disrupted Pathways) (Bozick & DeLuca, 2005; Roksa & Velez, 2012). For some participants, various difficulties experienced in the years after leaving care were related to subsequent delays in the pursuit of education similar to Montserrat et al.' (2013) findings.
* Many participants in this study identified multiple roles that they were navigating while pursuing, or seeking to pursue, further and higher education including being parents, employees, and carers. Several participants transitioned to being a student from, for example, being a parent, and were consequently navigating and managing both (and often other) roles at the same time.
* However, holding and navigating multiple roles may also present challenges to entering and progressing through further and higher education. We suggest that the presence, experience, and impact of these multiple roles in the educational pathways of adults with care experience represents a key area for future investigation and research.
* The transitions experienced by participants in this study during their educational journey suggest multiple, multilayered, complex, and potentially “off-time” transitions (for example becoming a parent or caring for a parent during the late teens/early twenties9) may be linked to the disrupted educational pathways of careexperienced adults. This issue warrants further investigation


# Concluding remarks



* Firstly, the life course principle of expected ‘diversity in life trajectories’ provides a valuable lens through which to consider the educational pathways of adults with care experience.
* Secondly, the potential for the concepts of roles and transitions to enhance our knowledge of this issue warrants further investigation.
* Thirdly, the pathways identified in this paper challenge our existing notions of educational “outcomes” when it comes to people with care experience.
* Fourthly, the pursuit of disrupted pathways into and through further and higher education by adults with care experience has implications for key professionals and adults working with children, young people, and adults with care experience.
* Promoting awareness and information regarding alternative pathways into education is potentially a key factor in fostering participation in education later in life more generally.
* Finally, the diverse and disrupted pathways through education taken by many participants in this study have implications for both policy and research in this area.
* The ‘implicit condition of eligibility for extended care or after care support’ may lead to those not in education suffering and being excluded from a service which may be very much needed (Gilligan, 2018: 12).
* This study has highlighted the value of drawing on the life course perspective when examining the educational experiences of adults with care experience. Life course principles and concepts such as ‘diversity in life course trajectories’ and ‘transitions’ provide useful conceptual tools for understanding and disentangling the complexity at the heart of this issue.
