## Normal Development

Several recurring developmental principles or themes are important to keep in mind when defining normal development and identifying growth processes and milestones.

### Nature and nurture
* There is an interaction between nature and nurture, that influences development
* For mental health professionals, it is necessary to consider the extent of their child clients’ normal or atypical development, it is important to recognize the complex interplay of nature and nurture and how this contributes to the clients’ clinical presentations.
### Developmental timing and plasticity
* Normal child development occurs on a continuum, ranging from children whose physical, cognitive, social-emotional, and behavioral development may lag behind those of their peers, to children who are precocious, meeting or surpassing developmental milestones before most children their age. Even still, a majority of children who develop slightly earlier or later than their peers may do so within a “normal” timeframe.
* It is useful to keep in mind that, barring early mental or physical disorders, lapses in development and deviations from the norm at different points in time are not necessarily predictive of subsequent developmental deficits or delays. Instead, children typically continue to grow and change. Traits or skills can be altered throughout the lifespan although they typically are more malleable earlier in development. This notion of plasticity is an important characteristic of normal child development. 
### Critical and sensitive periods
* Critical period: A critical period is a limited time that begins and ends abruptly during which a specific function develops. If the conditions for development are not available during that time it may be extremely difficult or even impossible to develop these functions later in life. 
* Sensitive period: A sensitive period is a time when it is easiest for children to acquire certain skills. It is similar to a critical period in that it is a time of optimal development, but it is best understood as a time of maximum sensitivity that begins and ends more gradually and is more amenable to recovery
* Role of culture and context
* development may vary considerably within and across racial/ethnic and cultural groups. 
* They may also vary according to other contextual differences including historical era, community, or socioeconomic status.
* Nature and timing of some capabilities are less likely to vary across context, particularly in physical and cognitive domains. Skills and behaviors— such as cooing and babbling, initiation of speech, or the ability to use abstract reasoning—develop in a more species-specific pattern; they are all capabilities that are unlikely to differ cross-culturally


## Stages of development

* Infancy: 0 to 2 years
* Toddlerhood and preschool: 2 to 5
* Childhood: 6 to 11
* Adolescence: 11 to 18


# Domains of development

## Cognitive development
* Cognitive development focuses on changes and growth in internal mental processes, such as -concrete and abstract thinking, reasoning, problem-solving, memorizing, recalling, planning, imaging, and creating.
* Linguistic development
* linguistic development domain references the child’s communication skills, developing speech patterns, and sentence structuring.
* Social-emotional development
* The social-emotional domain involves the development of relationships with others and the learning of social norms and customs, as well as growth in the ability to identify, understand, express, and modulate one’s feelings. 
* Behavioral development
* Behavioral milestones refer broadly to the child’s development of age-appropriate behavior, such as - following rules/regulating deviant behavior.


## Normal development in infancy and early toddlerhood (birth- 2yrs)

### Birth – 6 months
* Cognitive milestones
	* increased differentiation of external stimuli -patterns/colors/sounds
	* recognition of facial expressions
	* preference for familiar people. Closer to six months, babies may cry more often   when held by unfamiliar adults
	* cries to express needs (hunger, thirst, etc.)
	* are able to recognize and imitate adult facial expressions
	* infant’s memory and attention skills likewise improve

* Linguistic milestones

    - babies also begin cooing, making noises that are characterized by short vowel sounds, and move into babbling by four months, when consonant sounds are added and speech becomes repetitive (ex: “bababa”)

* Social-emotional and behavioral milestones

    - Early behavioral and emotional self-regulation based on the establishment of regular activities and routines (e.g., eating, sleeping, etc.)
    - Social smile: As a response to familiar human faces (6 weeks) and as initiated by the baby (3 or 4 months).
    - Multiple displays of emotions by age six months (e.g., frustration, anger, sadness, etc.)
    - Sleep cycles become more predictable by the age of eight weeks
    - Gaze aversion: Normal reaction to overstimulation and arousal
    - Individual and contextual differences in temperament

### Seven months – 1 year
* Cognitive milestones

	 - prevalence of object permanence, which is the understanding that objects or people still exist when they are not readily seen or heard.
	 - Growing perceptual and sensory capabilities
	 - Improvement of memory and attention skills: Dependent on the familiarity of the situation, person, or infant’s motivation
	 - begin to point at objects around age 1, as another form of communicating their desires.
	 - infants will learn and respond to their own name at this point

* Linguistic milestones
	* Infants may babble or make noises to suggest they want something (eg: toy, food

* Social-emotional and behavioral milestones
	* Able to differentiate the self from those around the infant
	* Social referencing begins, it is the term used to describe the way that infants take their cues from others in deciding what emotions and actions are appropriate in a specific situation
	* Development of attachment relationships: Infant’s bond with the primary caregiver
	* Separation anxiety: Displays anxiety when the caregiver leaves

### 13 months – 18 months
* Cognitive milestones
	* Memory storage and retrieval continue to advance
	* babies at this age can imitate others with increasing delays between the time of the observed behavior and the imitation of this behavior in other contexts
	* Infants at this age also begin to store prior experiences in memory and are aware when present situations are not in accordance with prior events/pre-existing expectations

* Linguistic milestones
	* Infants typically say their first word at 12 or 13 months
	* After the first word, vocabulary will grow to about 200 words during this period (this varies depending on the developmental environment)
* Social-emotional and behavioral milestones
	* more concrete signs of self-awareness develop
	* Infants now are aware that their body, emotions and behaviors are separate entities from those of their primary caregiver and from others

### 19 months – 2 years
* Cognitive milestones
	* cognitive advances continue in the areas of memory, problem-solving, and attention.
	* infants can develop and carry out action plans (eg: building a structure with blocks)

* Linguistic milestones
	- start combining two or more words

* Social-emotional and behavioral milestones
	* infant becomes aware of the names for various emotional states and starts to use language and other behaviors to regulate his or her emotional experience
	* shows an increased capacity for empathy
	* more complex emotions emerge at this time- embarrassment, guilt, and shame, all of which are emotional responses to others’ perspectives of the child’s behavior.
	* Behaviors indicative of separation anxiety decreases in their intensity during this stage and infants begin to show higher-level emotional regulation skills, such as delay of gratification.



## Normal development in late toddlerhood and preschool (2 yrs-5yrs)


* Cognitive milestones
	* normally developing children will engage in more complex sociodramatic play, including developing imaginary friends, reflecting a growing capacity for mental representations
	* Make-believe play with peers begins at age two or 2½, and increases in complexity until age four or five
	* At age three or four, toddlers also come to understand dual representation or the recognition that a symbolic object, such as a model of a train station, is both an object and a symbol of something else.
	* Private speech occurs when toddlers and preschoolers talk to themselves out loud, providing themselves with guidance when solving problems, such as thinking through or planning their behavior

* Linguistic milestones
	* Important milestones include the growth of the child’s vocabulary to about 2,000 words by age five.
	* Ability to define known words and integrate new words into sentences upon hearing them toward the end of the preschool period

* Social-emotional and behavioral milestones
	* At age two, there is a universal increase in physically aggressive behavior, which can include biting and hitting peers, family members, and the primary caregiver.
	* Temper tantrums are also normative during late toddlerhood.
	* understanding the emotions of others occur during this period. In particular, more complex behavioral and linguistic expressions of emotion, including empathy and sympathy, develop during this time. 
	* By age three or four, toddlers and preschoolers become more accurate in their appraisal of emotions and emotion-related behaviors in others, including peers
	* emotional display rules, children become more aware of when to display certain emotions
	* Children’s capacity to describe mental states and the characteristics of others also grows in accordance with increasing self-awareness and language skills
	* During this period, children also come to recognize cultural and racial differences between groups
	* become more aware of gender-stereotyped behavior by age five or six
	* children become more competent at feeding themselves
	* toileting oneself also typically emerges and becomes part of the child’s behavioral repertoire at this time
	* toddlers and preschoolers’ continuing growth in self-awareness, they become more curious about, and begin to explore themselves sexually.



## Normal development in childhood (6yrs -11 yrs.)

* Cognitive milestones
	* by age eight or nine most children can focus on their material, or are easily redirected.
	* Children also become aware of various skills to improve or increase memory. Using cognitive rehearsal strategies - the creation of mental cues and categories, or the repeating of information to help themselves recall important tasks or processes.
	* more orientation to time and spatial organization
	* more sophistication in the seriation and categorization of objects according to specific characteristics such as shape, size, length, color
	* increasing capacity for the processing of auditory and visual information
	* Problem-solving and reasoning also improve during childhood as thinking becomes more organized, creative, and flexible, and the capacity for metacognition, or “thinking about thinking” develops.
	* cognitive self-regulation or the process of monitoring one’s thoughts and actions in learning new skills also develops

* Linguistic milestones
	* vocabulary growth increases to an average of 10,000 words during this period.
	* acquire shading skills, or communication skills related to gradually changing the topic of the conversation.

* Social-emotional and behavioral milestones
	* self-esteem, or beliefs about self-worth, begins to drop in comparison to its higher levels during the toddler and preschool years
	* The need for self-control increases during this developmental stage as children engage in purposeful actions that are often in larger groups
	* children tend to play with children of their own genders
	* awareness of more complex emotions (pride, shame, guilt, embarrassment) becomes more sophisticated and children change their behavioral responses to such emotions as they develop in their maturity
	* Problem-focused coping occurs. Here children when children identify if the issue, they are facing is changeable or not, think about possible solutions, and then carry out their chosen solution.
	* Empathy is another complex emotional state that continues to develop during this period
	* Children become more sophisticated in their ability to think about the thoughts or emotions of others, showing increased perspective taking that also informs their capacity to demonstrate empathy.
	* Peer victimization or bullying also begins to occur more frequently
	* Progress in moral development



## Normal development in adolescence (12yrs - 18yrs)



* Cognitive milestones
	* growing self-consciousness and metacognition, or increased attention to and awareness of their own thought processes
	* due to the hormonal despite their greater sophistication in complex reasoning, adolescents may also become more impulsive and less attentive at times, and may also struggle to effectively make decisions and plan for the consequences of their behavior
	* Cognitive distortions about the self also appear with adolescents increased self-consciousness—called the imaginary audience and defined as a belief that they are the main focus of other people’s attention
	* The personal fable (Belief that one’s experiences and feelings are unique from others) may also give rise to a sense of invulnerability and singularity, creating a propensity for behavioral risk-taking
	* more advanced in their performance of mental operations and their information-processing skills and cognitive self-regulation improve overall. 
	* Greater planning and problem-solving abilities, abstract thinking and reasoning, and the capacity to understand, compare, or integrate advanced theoretical perspectives

* Linguistic milestones
	* vocabulary can grow to over 40,000 words by age 18
	* vocabulary will likely include a number of abstract terms, with adolescents mastering the syllable stress and intonation of these more difficult words
	* By age 14, adolescents will use and understand conversational nuances, such as sarcasm or irony
	* By age 18, their communication patterns are increasingly patterned according to specific contextual cues or societal expectations across a variety of environmental situations

* Social-emotional and behavioral milestones
	* Adolescents are more self-aware and self-conscious than younger children and may engage in more frequent risk-taking or experimentation, particularly when encouraged to do so by peers.
	* Mild to moderate variations in mood and behavior
	* Importance of peer group conformity
	* Peer victimization becomes more social or relationally focused in content



## Additional advice to practitioners



* A lack of food, housing, or financial security can make it difficult for parents to provide sensitive, responsive, and stimulating care to their children. For this reason, practitioners and health workers should be especially aware of such stressors in order to support parents who are learning to respond to crying newborns, so as not to become an additional source of stress for the family (birth- 6 months)
* Practitioners should note that parents who are more informed about the benefits of pretend play may take a more active role in introducing complexity and diversity into play themes (19 months – 2 years)
* Magical thinking or belief in otherworldly figures will vary according to cultural beliefs and norms, and continued belief in these figures is not necessarily atypical in certain cultural contexts. Health practitioners working with these communities should take these beliefs into account when conceptualizing normal development. (2 years -5 years)
* It is important for practitioners to understand the cultural norms of their clients and how they can best align with acceptable practices.
* Practitioners and other healthcare providers should be aware of the culture and context in which their clients are embedded and should practice cultural sensitivity, both when examining adolescent transitions to adulthood and when considering the previous developmental stages.
