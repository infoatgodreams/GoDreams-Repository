# Parent-Child Separation


## Causes for Parent-Child Separation?

* Beyond forced displacement, international migration is also at an all-time high, with 258 million people estimated to live in a country, not of their birth in 2017.
* Beyond international migration, parent-child separation also occurs in internal migration, for example, when children are left behind when parents migrate.
* define parent-child separation as longer than routine daily or even weekly separations associated with parental work or other factors.
* parent-child separation due to migration of one generation but not the other (i.e., situations in which children migrate without their parents, as well as those in which parents migrate without their children).
* Separation occurs for many reasons, both involuntary and volitional, including persecution, conflict, war, disaster, and search for work and other opportunities not available in a home country.
* parents separated from children during the asylum process (either during flight or after arrival in the host country), 
* unaccompanied children who flee persecution or war without their parents, and trafficking or 
* conscription of children in the context of conflict or migration.


## Effects of Parent-Child Separation



* Experiencing persecution, conflict, war, or disaster in childhood has well-documented negative impacts on children’s health, learning, well-being, and educational progress.
* parents can provide a buffering presence that mitigates the severity of these impacts on their children, providing both physical protection and emotional security.
* Separation of children and parents in these contexts both removes this important source of mitigating adversity and compounds the stress and trauma that a child experiences, amounting to a potentially devastating developmental and psychological impact.
* the experiences of evacuated children to better understand the consequences of physical separation from their mothers and learned that in many cases separation was even more traumatic for children than exposure to the stressors associated with war and frequent air raids.
* attachments with their mothers, how sensitive and responsive parenting was key to the formation of secure attachments, and how this process can be disrupted in situations of prolonged (greater than 6 months) separations from mothers before the age of 5.
* Disruptions in attachment were therefore conceptualized as the key mechanism linking parent-child separation to emotional and behavioural problems.
* Secure attachment, for example, was found to protect against the vulnerabilities posed by institutionalization, early deprivation such as household income poverty, and other risks experienced during childhood.
* effects of early institutionalization on later development documented the role of a larger set of contextual and individual mechanisms:
    * including exposure to peers with problem behaviours, 
    * poverty-related factors, and 
    * physiological factors such as stress reactivity in children and their caregivers 
* parent–child separations, whether voluntary on the part of parents or involuntary and forced in nature, have negative consequences across 
    * cognitive, 
    * social-emotional, and 
    * mental health domains for children and youth, 
    * with evidence of disruptions in adult–child relationships, peer relationships, and physiological processes as mechanisms.

## Types of Parent-Child Separation:
### Children in Institutions:

* approximately eight million children worldwide live in institutions separated from parents
* Institutional care carries risks for poorer cognitive and social-emotional development, especially for young children
* little opportunity for engagement in relationships with caregivers, all of which have been linked to poorer learning, social, and emotional outcomes.
* Institutional care may vary in quality and can be categorized into three types: 

    (a) institutions with global deprivation of both physical and psychosocial needs, 


    (b) institutions that provide basic nutritional and physical needs but deprive children of stimulation and relationship needs, and 


    (c) institutions that meet nutritional, physical, and stimulation needs but deprive children of stable, long-term relationships with caregivers.

* what most institutions had in common from a comprehensive global review:
    * institutions were characterized by relatively high group sizes even during the infant/toddler years, Child-to-caregiver ratios in their review ranged from 8:1 to 31:1.
    * staff were often not consistently assigned to the same group and worked long and shifting hours.
    * caregivers received limited training with the focus more often on health and nutrition rather than on responsive caregiving and psychosocial or mental health support.
    * do their duties in a business-like manner with little warmth or sensitivity to individual children’s emotional needs.


#### Effects: 
* Effects can manifest in higher rates of developmental delays or poorer developmental outcomes (Wade et al. 2019).
* Outcomes, typically measured in comparison with low-income children from the same country or low-income children in host communities,
* if the samples have migrated, include poorer brain functioning, smaller brain size, lower levels of cognition, and elevated social/behavioural problems, specifically disinhibition, inattention, hyperactivity, and attachment disruptions.
* Institutional care showed large negative associations with physical growth, language, and cognitive, social-emotional, and brain development
* institutionalized children were more likely to be categorized as insecurely attached  
* Negative impacts of early institutionalization can persist over time, even after leaving institutional care. 
* the physiological effects of stress on the limbic and neuroendocrine system in three groups: Romanian children living in institutions, children adopted early into Canadian families (under 4 months of age), and Canadian-born children living at home with their birth parents. Six and a half years after adoption, children who lived more than 8 months in Romanian orphanages exhibited higher ambulatory cortisol levels.
* at age 16, early-emerging deficits in problem-solving, attention, spatial planning, and short-term visual attention persisted into adolescence, and the gap in spatial working memory between once-institutionalized and never-institutionalized children widened in comparison to earlier in childhood.


#### Mitigating Factors:


##### Foster care placement:
* children who are placed in foster care before 24 months of age are more likely to have secure attachments despite their early time in institutional care 
* show cognitive development scores in the normal range.
* at 42 and 54 months old, children who had been placed in foster care showed cognitive gains over their peers who remained in orphanages.
* Placement in foster care also improves electroencephalogram measures of brain activity, relative to those who remained in institutional care.
*  when children have to be separated from their parents, the quality of caregiving matters.


##### Time and timing in institutions

* Length of time in an institution appears to be negatively associated with developmental outcomes.  
* at age 4, the duration of institutional stay was positively related to the number of symptoms of attachment disorder.
* Cognitive recovery was inversely related to the length of stay in institutional care.
* tracking children 5 to 11 years after adoption from an orphanage, the sample performed worse on cognitive and language measures compared to nonadopted children, but that performance was inversely related to time spent in institutional care,
* prolonged residence in orphanages led to higher neuropsychological deficits in memory, attention, and inhibitory control but similar levels to peers in auditory processing, rule acquisition, and planning
* cortisol differences into middle childhood and found that children who lived more than 8 months in Romanian orphanages still exhibited elevated physiological stress.
* Generally, the earlier and younger that children leave institutional care for stable foster care or adoption, the better it is for their outcomes and trajectory.
* For children placed at or after 15 months old, expressive language and receptive language were negatively impacted into early childhood but not later.
* At 18 months of age or after, parasympathetic nervous system reactivity was negatively affected into early adolescence (age 12).
* When placed at or after 24 months of age, a child’s IQ, attachment organization, and security were negatively affected into early childhood. 
* those placed before 30 months of age showed growth in their learning and visual-spatial memory such that they were indistinguishable from other children by age 16.
* research on children in institutional care indicates that parent-child separation in the form of institutional custody should be minimized and avoided, with stable foster care or adoption a preferred arrangement.
* Duration of institutional care negatively impacts child outcomes in a wide range of domains in the short run and some outcomes into adolescence


### Refugees Fleeing War and Persecution:


### Forced separation during asylum:
* a refugee is defined as “someone who is unable or unwilling to return to their country of origin owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion”
* Asylum is the designation of protection in these situations; the host country’s asylum process determines whether refugee arrivals will receive this designation
*  detention as “the deprivation of liberty or confinement in a closed place which an asylum-seeker is not permitted to leave at will, including, though not limited to, prisons or purpose-built detention, closed reception or holding centres or facilities.”


#### Guidelines:
* UN Convention on the Rights of the Child states that detention not be indefinite and that “in all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interest of the child shall be a primary consideration” 
* prioritization of family unity.
* “consider progressively abolishing the administrative detention of migrants.
* ensuring that the legislation does not allow for the detention of unaccompanied children and that detention of children is permitted only as a measure of last resort.
* and only when it is determined to be in the best interests of the child.


#### Effects:



* Beyond the immediate and large economic effects on families due to the decline in household income associated with the detained parent, children were observed following large workplace raids to show elevated behaviour problems as well as depressive symptoms and school absenteeism.
* the Society for Research in Child Development’s statement asserted that children depend on their parents to buffer them from the adverse effects of toxic stress associated with traumatic events.
* Parent-child separation in extreme stress can and will worsen the physical and emotional toll it takes on children.
* children and adolescents who have already faced previous adversity are particularly susceptible to long-term further negative consequences.


#### Potential mitigating factors:
* no direct studies.
* community-based organizations and policymakers have issued family preparedness guidelines in the United States to help alleviate the negative consequences of parent-child separation among families with undocumented parents.
* identifying guardians in the event that a parent is detained.
* providing “know your rights” information such as not letting a border and customs agent into one’s home without a warrant
* Other approaches that have prevented parent-child separation have included churches or other faith-based organizations serving as sanctuary spaces


### Unaccompanied minors:
* some children are separated from their parents by official state procedures in the process of seeking asylum, other children undertake flight or migration on their own, unaccompanied by a parent or adult family member.
* Some prefer the term ‘unaccompanied minors’ to ‘separated minors’ emphasizing the distance between child and family and that they may or may not be technically unaccompanied but may in fact be in the company of nonrelated adults such as a trafficker, an agent, or siblings who are minors 
* The process of migration, for unaccompanied children, includes stressors at each phase, including premigration, transit, and arrival. 
* Premigration, unaccompanied children are likely to have experienced threats and witnessed or been victims of violence
* in transit, unaccompanied children are vulnerable to a range of risks, including safety threats, abuse, and attacks
* on arrival, unaccompanied children face uncertainty in unfamiliar surroundings without their usual sources of support.
* may also experience stressful detention experiences in which conditions and treatment may be poor or prisonlike and unfit for children.


#### Effects:
* Most studies assessing the psychological impact of migration on unaccompanied children are qualitative reports by advocacy groups; thus, there are virtually no empirical studies.
* high rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, aggression, and suicidal ideation among unaccompanied children in detention.
* Compared with refugee children who flee with their families, unaccompanied children are at greater risk for trauma and mental illness.
* The mean number of traumatic events experienced by unaccompanied minors was 28, more than double the amount for accompanied refugee children, which was 12.
    * Unaccompanied children were more likely (63%) to have been a victim of four or more traumatic events in their lives (including preflight, during flight, and after arrival) than children and adolescents with families (16%)
    * a higher occurrence of depressive disorder (46% of unaccompanied compared to 27% of accompanied), 
    * borderline personality disorder (22% versus 9%) and 
    * psychosis (15% versus 1%) compared with refugee children with families. 
    * Sixty-seven percent of unaccompanied refugee girls and 14% of unaccompanied boys had experienced sexual abuse.


#### Mitigating Factors:
* post-arrival foster parents buffer the negative effects of the trauma of solo migration and resettlement.
* 20 foster parents reflected on the qualities and supports that made a positive difference in their adjustment and success to their new homes in the United States:
* Sudanese children’s work ethic indicated charisma, interpersonal skills, and commitment to education contributed to their children’s success
* unaccompanied refugee children include a focus on goals, a high locus of control, intelligence, future orientation, religious faith, seeing their refugee status as an opportunity, resourcefulness, and adaptability
* Sudanese youth attributed their success to the emotional support and advice of their foster parents and the services, housing, money, tutoring, and classes of host agencies
* importance of their peer group for emotional and instrumental support and the school as a central source of community support, activities, and outings
* The psychological presence of the refugee children’s parents also remained a source of guidance and resilience.


### Child-Trafficking and Conscription


#### Child-Trafficking:

* Human trafficking is the “recruitment and movement of people—most often through the use of deception, threat, coercion, or the abuse of vulnerability—for the purposes of exploitation”.
* 33% of the victims were children.
* confront an abundance of challenges to their safety, their development, their health, and even their lives. For those who are trafficked into sexual servitude, HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases present a threat to their survival.
* access to care for these vulnerable children is especially limited
* children and youth are likely to be unaware of their rights or of available services


#### Effects:

* important to recognize the distinct burden of trafficking: the multitude of traumas experienced chronically for long periods of time and typically involving multiple perpetrators
* Mental health disorders are prevalent among trafficked children. In a qualitative study of 29 young people trafficked into the United Kingdom, over half of the young people have been trafficked for sex work (n = 15):
    * sexual violence had been experienced by those trafficked both for sex and for domestic and other labour (n = 18). 
    * In addition, physical violence (n = 24), deprivation (n = 29), threats to family (n = 11), and restrictions of freedom (n = 18) were widely experienced.
    * Two-thirds of participants screened positive for high levels of mental health disorders.
    * participants showed high levels of depression (56%), anxiety (33%), and PTSD (26%) (Kiss et al. 2015). 
    * Approximately one-third of participants had experienced physical and/or sexual violence while trafficked
* mental health symptoms were strongly associated with recent self-harm and suicide attempts; 12% of participants had tried to harm or kill themselves in the month before the interview


#### Conscription:

Child soldiers are defined as “any person below 18 years of age who is or who has been recruited or used by an armed force or armed group in any capacity, including but not limited to children, boys and girls, used as fighters, cooks, porters, messengers, spies, or for sexual purposes”.


#### Effects:
* Abducted and conscripted children are more anxious and depressed, more hostile, and less prosocially active than children who were never abducted and never served with the armed forces
* PTSD symptoms are rampant among abducted and conscripted children. In one study, 97% of abductees demonstrated clinical levels of PTSD.
* 141 former child soldiers in Nepal with 141 never-conscripted children matched on age, sex, education, and ethnicity. While both groups showed mental health and psychosocial problems, child soldiers fared worse.
* depression among girls and PTSD among girls and boys even after controlling for trauma exposure.
* Exposure to trauma and the resulting impacts on former child soldiers vary depending on the age of abduction, duration of captivity, location of captivity, and military training. 


#### Mitigating Factors:
* former child soldiers have demonstrated social and psychological resilience when community acceptance is high 
* Post-soldiering adjustment in former child soldiers in Sierra Leone, examining the role of stigma and its relationship between war experiences and psychological adjustment back into the community.
* family acceptance was associated with decreased hostility, and increased community acceptance was associated with adaptive behaviours and attitudes.


### Left-Behind Children:

volitional separation when parents pursue economic or other opportunities not available at home. In these cases, parents typically leave their child(ren) behind with a caregiver, creating a potentially vulnerable global population of left-behind children.


#### Effects:
* parent-child separation due to economic migration affects children in a range of ways and contexts, including lower school performance, increased conflicts with teachers and peers, anxiety, low self-esteem, depressive tendencies, loneliness, and substance abuse 
* children separated from their mothers for 4 years or longer reported significantly higher-level anxiety and depression symptoms than those who were never separated, controlling for developmental level and country of origin.
* risks to development for children left behind appear to be generally similar across cultures, studies in specific country contexts reveal mitigating factors that may moderate those negative effects.
* children who were left behind in Jamaica, compared with peers living with both parents, showed elevated depression scores and a higher probability of behavioural problems.
* Children who were left behind by migrating parents had poorer school performance; increased feelings of abandonment, anger, and loneliness; and more sleep complaints. 
* The gender of the child was not found to be a factor. In terms of mitigating factors, having a supportive family and being able to talk to someone buffered the negative impact on the child. 
* In one study of Chinese rural children left behind by parents left-behind children performed as well as children living with both parents, although both groups performed poorly.
* parent migration impacted left-behind children by increasing their workloads and reducing study tutoring, supervision, and parental affection.


#### Mitigating Factors:

* in a sample of left-behind adolescents, a teacher-student relationship positively predicted self-esteem and negatively predicted depression and problem behaviours.
* association between teacher-student relationship and depression was stronger among the left-behind group. 
* friend companionship for left-behind children was positively associated with their emotional outcomes and moderated the association between father-child cohesion and emotional outcomes among children with two migrating parents. 
* the parent-child relationship itself may serve to mitigate the negative effects of separation.


## Interventions Mitigating Negative Effects of Separation

* Characteristics of the school-based group, community-based group, and community-level interventions and associated positive outcomes are highlighted, followed by cross-cutting issues and themes across the intervention types. 
* therapy provided through dyadic mental health interventions is excluded from this review due to a lack of controlled interventions with separated or unaccompanied children.


### School-Based Group Interventions

* In India, a school-based intervention targeted Tibetan adolescents living in exile with limited family contact. 
* This life skills training intervention, carried out with 300 adolescents aged 13–19 years, showed positive social and mental health impacts. 
* Groups of 5 to 11 adolescents were randomly assigned to the intervention or to regular school classes. The intervention group was introduced to 10 life skills and 28 subskills.
* This program reduced youth reports of stress related to, school, leisure and the future through various skill-based course topics such as creative thinking, critical thinking, effective communication, empathy, and decision making.
* Classroom-based interventions can be feasibly implemented by nonspecialized, trained personnel. Children with lower levels of war-related stressors had larger improvements in mental health.
* 400 children aged 9–12 years, 35% of whom had witnessed the death of a family member and others who had experienced family separation. 
* Fifteen sessions were carried out over 5 weeks in groups of up to 15 youth. There were no intervention effects on primary outcomes; however, for those with lower levels of war-related stressors at baseline, there were statistically significant reductions in PTSD symptoms, anxiety, and functional impairment.
* school-based cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) group intervention in two schools in London for traumatized refugee or asylum-seeking children from countries affected by war. 
* Teachers identified participants based on students’ classroom behaviour and their disclosure of traumatic events.
*  Across the sample, one-third had lost a parent in war, 15% had been separated from both parents, and 44% had experienced separation from one parent. 
* The intervention reduced overall and intrusive PTSD symptoms and increased improvements in behaviour, as indicated by a teacher measure. 
* Writing for Recovery, a classroom-based intervention developed by the Children and War Foundation for bereaved children and youth was implemented with 61 Afghani adolescents living in Iran.
* the intervention consisted of two 15-minute sessions implemented on three consecutive days and initially focused on writing self-reflections of trauma or loss experiences, followed gradually by more externally directed writing, such as advice for those who may have gone through similar experiences.
* significantly decreased traumatic grief symptoms, according to a self-report measure.


### Community-Based Group Interventions

* Group interventions may be an effective way to target multiple youths who have experienced loss and separation in a single setting while facilitating social interaction with others facing a similar experience.
* trauma-focused, cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT)
* 15 TF-CBT sessions were group-based, except for two to four individual sessions. Special attention was given to culturally appropriate adaptions of the intervention materials, and the intervention was delivered with Congolese counsellors. The intervention was shown to significantly reduce symptoms including posttraumatic stress, distress, depression, and anxiety and to increase prosocial behaviour.
* Utilizing preexisting community and social services and programming might be an effective way to leverage systems that are already in place to reach those separated from a caregiver.
* In Germany, Mein Weg, or My Way focused on psychoeducation and eliciting trauma narratives.
* As part of Mein Weg, groups of two to five participants attended 90-minute sessions six times a week. The intervention significantly decreased participants’ posttraumatic stress symptoms, as measured by the Child and Adolescent Trauma Screen self-report.
* As family members and caregivers can create support systems for children and youth experiencing separation and loss, involving them in community-based group interventions presents a salient approach to programming.
* Family Bereavement Program: The treatment condition consisted of 12, 2-h sessions each week, four of which were for youths and their caregivers together, and the control condition, which was written material on bereavement
* to increase positive coping and decrease negative thoughts and stressors. The program decreased levels of behavioural problems according to a behaviour checklist.
* Youths who had lower levels of mental health issues at the beginning also experienced lower levels of mental disorder diagnoses based on self-report and a version of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children.


### Community-Level Interventions

* Community-level interventions for youth affected by war or for unaccompanied refugee youth have integrated community members and leaders, as well as utilized a variety of community and/or accessible public spaces, to reach children and youth. 
* Youth Readiness Intervention, which integrated CBT and interpersonal therapy developed for 15- to 24-year-olds in a randomized controlled trial.
* Program outreach, recruitment, and implementation were done at the community level, and the 10–12 intervention sessions at times involved family and community members as a way to foster engagement and establish a support system.
* improved with regard to emotion regulation and prosocial behaviour, as well as educational engagement, like attendance and enrollment, according to a teacher survey (classroom performance scale) and youth report. 
* Communities may seek to address the negative effects of separation through a collaboration among government agencies, trained staff, and other organizations, such as charities or non-governmental organizations.
* The community-based intervention, the Children Companion Mothers Program (CCMP), took place over 3 years. As part of the intervention, each participating village had a physical space for children to attend after-school activities; a paid, full-time program employee providing welfare services and program access to children; and a commitment of local governing institutions and authorities to collaboratively solve issues faced by left-behind children, as identified by the village program employee. 
*  overall, results suggest that this community-level approach may have reduced disparities between left-behind and non-left-behind groups as shown by CCMP participants’ levels on various well-being indicators.
* CCMP participants exhibited higher resilience, safety awareness, and communicative competence as well as better academic performance, guardianship, and physical health habits than participants in the control group, according to self-report measures. 


# Conclusion

* Several of the evaluations showed that programs targeted to those who have experienced parent-child separation may be most beneficial to those who have fewer personal risk factors at baseline
* lower levels of trauma and stressors were associated with positive outcomes. 
* This might suggest that the integration of various programs bolstering psychosocial well-being and support in existing structures can serve as a protective measure to prepare students for healthier outcomes in adverse, but potentially unavoidable, situations. 
* Accounts of a school-based group, community-based group, and community-level interventions described the presence of support systems of peers and adults, including teachers and caregivers.
* collaboration among educators, including teachers and paraprofessionals, government agencies, volunteers and community leaders trained to deliver mental health programming.
* identify those who are suffering from the negative impacts of parent and family separation and are also aware of services available and how to connect children to these services. 
* As such, the creation of collaborative networks can serve as a protective factor to mitigate trauma following temporary or sustained parent separation.
* focus on skill-building (e.g., decision making, problem-solving, communication, and relaxation as stress management) 
* Providing children and youths with useful content explicitly focused on equipping them for their daily life and future.
* future directions for research:
    * First, developmental scientists should examine the nuances of specific policies regarding their effects on children and youth. 
    * Developmental scientists may need to either collaborate further with immigration policy experts or include in their training programs an exploration of the specifics of immigration policy alongside more commonly studied areas of policy such as those related to poverty or education.
    * studying migration around the world would benefit from consistently gathering data on patterns of separation—overall duration, number of spells of separation, and the developmental timing of separation episodes.
    * s coordinated efforts to develop brief approaches to assessing separation in studies of displaced, refugee, or migration populations that include developmental outcomes.
    * mitigating-factor research could be expanded to include a larger and more up-to-date range of phenomena that have been studied to date.
    * Do remittances (sent by parents or by youth) and the support they provide in home countries play a mitigating role, and if so, under what circumstances? 
    * How do siblings or other family members play a mitigating role when parent-child separation occurs?
    *  Finally, sorely lacking are intervention research and policy analysis that aims to improve the family process and child development upon reunion or (perhaps more importantly) strive to prevent parent-child separation in the first place.
