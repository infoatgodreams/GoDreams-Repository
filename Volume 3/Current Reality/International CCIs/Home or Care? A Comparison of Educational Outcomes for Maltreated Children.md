# Brief:

* Scope & Description: A study was conducted to explore the differences in educational outcomes between children-in-care and children-out-of-care and it was found that being in care is not a directly related with poor educational outcomes. Other influential factors were found that are discussed.

# Difference between educational outcomes of children in care with those out-of-care

- More recently, an analysis of GCSE examination results of all children at the age of sixteen (General Certificate of Secondary Education) found that although children in care had significantly lower average point scores than children in the wider population, those continuously in care for one year or more performed better in examinations than ‘children in need’, who received home-based services (Sebba et al., 2015). Children in care for less than a year per- formed worst of all, a finding consistent with another study which reported better educational outcomes for adolescents in long-term foster placements (Dixon et al., 2006).
- Some studies in the USA and Australia that compared children in care to other child welfare-involved children found no differences in academic performance after controlling for differences between the groups(Font and Mcguire-Jack, 2013; Berger et al., 2015), although others found their educational performance was worse than that of the comparison group (Weiss and Fantuzzo, 2001; Smithgall et al., 2004). 
- However, an American study that compared children in care to others in the community, including maltreated children not in care, reported that children’s test scores on various measures were fully or partly mediated by maltreatment (Fantuzzo and Perlman, 2007).
- Both the children currently in care and those in the home group were less likely to meet age-related expectations for receptive vocabulary, literacy and communication than children in the general population. Children in the care appeared slightly more likely to meet the standard age-related expectations for receptive vocabulary than the home group, although this difference did not quite reach significance. 
- In teacher assessments of communication (listening, speaking and understanding), however, the care group were significantly less likely to meet expectations than the home group. Nevertheles, the difference between children in care and other children with histories of child welfare involvement was not statistically significant, reflecting findings elsewhere
- The two groups proved to be well-matched in terms of their current age and welfare histories, and there was also little difference between them on measures of parenting style. However, children in the care group were significantly more likely to have experienced severe maltreatment. They had also experienced a significantly higher total number of risk factors, including more types of abuse and neglect and more parental problems. 
- The care group were also more likely to be disabled and to have SEN, although these differences did not quite reach statistical significance. Their parents were nearly twice as likely to have problems of drug or alcohol misuse, and were more likely to be involved in offending and to have a disability or chronic health problem. More serious histories of adversity may increase both the risk of admission to care and the risk of poor educational outcomes, thus potentially operating as a confounding factor, which may help to explain differences in attainment between children in care and those in the wider population.
- Differences in the pre-school skills of advantaged and disadvantaged children have been found to be predominantly in language and communication. Early language, including vocabulary development, is linked to early literacy and it is this that is linked to wider educational attainment and later-life outcomes (Phillips and Lonigan, 2009; Marmot, 2010).
-  For most children who start school behind their peers, the attainment gap will only increase throughout their school career. 
- It is therefore essential to understand the early development of vocabulary, communication and literacy skills for children who enter care at an early age.
- This article reports the findings of a new study, which drew on a set of variables compiled from multiple data sources to compare the educational development of a sample of young children in care due to abuse or neglect to that for children with histories of maltreatment currently living at home. 
- The analysis draws on the conceptual framework that children’s backgrounds and pre-care experiences, including of maltreatment, are implicit in mediating their educational outcomes. 
- Studies, which have tried to overcome this selection bias by comparing children in care to others with similar demographic characteristics have reported a weaker relationship between placement and educational outcomes. 
- Others have compared them to children involved with child welfare services who remain at home, with an early English study finding that foster children performed no worse than a comparison group receiving social work support in the community. It concluded that, whilst care did not appear to compensate children for prior educational disadvantage, nor was it the cause of their poor educational achievement


# Other factors influencing educational outcomes of children in care with those out-of-care

- Other factors influencing poor educational outcomes were having behaviour problems at school (receptive vocabulary and literacy) and receiving support for SEN (literacy and communication).
- Children’s pre-care experiences, including abuse, neglect and other adversities, the emotional and behavioural problems they may develop as a consequence of these experiences and the higher likelihood that they would have a disability or SEN are all likely to play a part in driving educational outcomes for these children.
- Children in the care group were significantly more likely to have experienced severe maltreatment. They had also experienced a significantly higher total number of risk factors, including more types of abuse and neglect and more parental problems. The care group were also more likely to be disabled and to have SEN, although these differences did not quite reach statistical significance. Their parents were nearly twice as likely to have problems of drug or alcohol misuse, and were more likely to be involved in offending and to have a disability or chronic health problem.
