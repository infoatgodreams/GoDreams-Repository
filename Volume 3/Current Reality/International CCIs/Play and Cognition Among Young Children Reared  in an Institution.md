# Brief:

* **Scope & Description:** 

    Assessing the relationship between cognitive functioning and play behaviours of children residing in an orphanage. Comparing previous data for children of the same chronological age (Twenty-six young children (15 boys) between 10 and 38 months of age) living at home. The findings suggest that the relationship between thinking and playing is robust, even in an institutional environment. Additionally, practitioners assessing children from institutions who cannot engage in standardized testing may consider observing play behaviours to make an initial estimate of developmental status.

# Introduction: 

## Relevance of Play: (Cognition and Play)

* Play has been related to the development of both cognition and social competence (Fisher, 1992).
* Play involved moving from learning schemes such as grasping or swinging an object, to new schemes involving higher levels of integration through pleasurable, spontaneous, and unorganized repetition and synthesis. 
* According to Vygotsky (1978), play behaviours do not precisely mirror cognitive or other developmental processes, but play is an impetus for development.
    * **Play and development:** Studies describing play and its relationship to development have demonstrated associations with cognition, motor skills, language, sensory processing, socialization, affect, and disposition
    * children progress through a succession of simple to more complex play stages associated with cognition.
    * The strong correlation between cognition and play parallels other studies of children with developmental disabilities. In these studies, children with cognitive delays progressed more slowly than typical peers in their achievement on standardized assessments of cognition; however, the correlation between cognition and play was moderate to high
    * sample of children residing in an Eastern European orphanage demonstrated play behaviours that 
        * (a) can be classified on a play scale, and 
        * (b) progress through hierarchical levels of play, despite living in an environment devoid of many of the typical play objects and opportunities that home-reared children encounter. 

    The findings indicate that the relationship between cognition and play is relatively robust.


## Play in Young, Institutionalized Children
* In a classic field study of child development in orphanages, Provence and Lipton (1962) described infants reaching for and grasping toys until 5 or 6 months of age, but from that point on their exploration dwindled and continued to do so with further institutionalization.
* Children with flat affect reject toys and withdraw
* Children cared for in institutions exhibited less exploratory play, less varied play, and developmentally lower levels of play than their home-reared peers. (These findings must, however, be interpreted conservatively).
* Kaler and Freeman (1994) conducted a play test on Romanian children. The children’s level of play behaviours was positively correlated with performance on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (r = .64). The authors described the children’s play behaviours as “... quite low for the sample’s chronological age but appropriate for the mental age”


## Play Behaviors of Children Who Are Adopted into Families from Institutions? 
* **Methodology:** 
	*  Assessed play behaviours of 4-year olds, previously adopted from Romanian orphanages 2 years earlier by British families. 
	* Comparison group: British-born adoptees with no institutionalization adopted before 6 months of age
* British-born adoptees exhibited significantly higher levels of pretend play, roleplay and referencing of others’ mental states than the Romanian adoptees, suggesting that the effects of institutionalization may be long-lasting. 


### Developmental context in assessment of institutionalized children.

*  Kaler and Freeman suggested using caution when interpreting results from assessments such as the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and similar developmental measures when evaluating children who have experienced institutionalization. 
* It is likely that children living in institutions have had little experience with objects such as toys, balls, and puzzles that are used in these evaluations. It is possible that this unfamiliarity can influence assessment results.
* a weak relationship between play and cognition could also indicate that moderating variables, such as motivation, sense of security, or motor behaviours, were influencing this relationship. 
* Conversely, if institutionalized children demonstrated play behaviours that highly corresponded with standardized measures, it may offer practitioners alternatives during challenging assessments. 


# Methodology:

## Measures:  [[Assessment Tools]]

* Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 2nd edition (BSID-II; Bayley, 1993). We used the BSID-II to assess children’s general cognitive development. 
* Play assessment: used two toy sets to assess play. 
    * The first consisted of exploratory toys comparable to those donated to the institutions. 
    * The second set consisted primarily of symbolic toys to provide sufficient opportunity to elicit the children’s symbolic play behaviours.


## Procedure (Implications for future application, relevance of caregiver):

* All assessments were conducted in the child’s living area or another area typically frequented by that child where sounds and visual distractions could be minimized.
* Children’s native language used.
* After completing the BSID-II, the child was invited to a play area where he or she was videotaped playing for 6 min with the exploratory toys and 6 min with the symbolic toys. 
* During the play observations, the first author sat near the child and observed. Not surprisingly, given that a child is rarely in an area by him or herself in an orphanage, pilot testing had indicated that the children were better able to remain in solitary free play if the examiner was in close proximity. 
* Compared participants to those from a sample reported in the literature of children reared at home (McCune, 1995). 
* Similarly, Sorce and Emde (1981) found that just the supportive presence of a child’s mother, without any interaction, could significantly improve the child’s amount of time spent in exploration and play behaviours. 
* Given that many studies have demonstrated that caregivers’ interactions facilitate play beyond a child’s independent play behaviours 
* The examiner did not initiate interactions. The examiner responded to any play or social bids from the children by saying warmly, “I have work, you play here.”


## Findings:

1. Observations based on chronological age: 
* The youngest participants (13 months) primarily engaged in exploratory play with time spent in functional relational play increasing in children 18 months old
* The symbolic play emerged in children 19–24 months and 25–30 months old; however, children still spent over half of their time in exploratory play.
* Children 31–38 months old spent the majority of time in functional play, additionally, this group spent more time in symbolic play than younger children.
* The correlation between chronological ages and DPS total scores (r = .77, p ≤ .01) indicates that older children had higher play behaviours. 
* The correlation between BSID-II mental development raw scores and total play scores (r = .78, p ≤ .01) indicates that children with higher scores for mental development had higher play behaviours.
* When compared to McCune’s sample by mental (cognitive) age, the institutionalized children did not perform significantly different in symbolic play.
* when compared to children with the same chronological age in McCune’s sample, fewer children from the sample demonstrated play behaviours at each level of play with the exception of symbolic play (level 10). 
* This finding paralleled Kreppner and colleagues’ (1999) findings that play behaviours of children previously institutionalized were rated lower than those of a comparison group. 
* Generally, the number of children in our investigation whose play behaviours were at or above mental age expectations did not differ significantly from McCune’s (1995) sample.
* children living in institutions appeared to play at a level better matching their mental than chronological age.
* In addition to underlying cognitive abilities, such as those related to expressive language, other foundational behaviours such as object manipulation and social development have been found to be associated with play behaviours.
* Further research is needed to clarify how specific component abilities relate to play.
2. Limitations:

    Comparing to McCune’s sample: Such a comparison has obvious limitations and should be interpreted conservatively. 

* First, we cannot determine the inter-rater reliability for assessing play levels between the two studies.
* Second, our sample was smaller than McCune’s. 
* Third, a sample of children with typical development living at home is not an ideal comparison group.

# Suggestions:

* Would be instructive to have another type of comparison group such as children born in the United States who are adopted to better understand which delays may be more characteristic of children who have been institutionalized.
* Given the cognitive delays in our sample, another option would be to contrast children living in institutions to children with mixed developmental disabilities living home-reared children matched for both mental and chronological age in order to test whether delays in play behaviours are specific to institutionalization in contrast to cognitive delay.
3. Implications:
* Findings suggest that cognitive development, as measured by the standardized BSID-II, is related to play behaviours. 
* This finding also suggests that play assessments may be used by therapists attempting to assess children newly adopted from institutions who are difficult to engage in standardized testing, but able to be engaged in play. 
* A therapist familiar with a play scale similar to the one used in this study may be able to gauge a child’s developmental status through observing play behaviours.
* There is a paucity of evidence available to guide practitioners in providing intervention to children who have developmental delays in addition to having experienced an adverse early environment such as institutionalization. 
* More data specific to physical and occupational therapy are needed. Pediatric physical and occupational therapy practitioners are encouraged to advocate for the needs of these children.
