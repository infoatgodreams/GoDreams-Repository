# Brief:

- Scope & Description: Special health care needs are prevalent among children in the child welfare system. Many children with special health care needs have cognitive, language, adaptive, social, or behavioral functional impairments. For this study data was obtained from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-being, a national probability study of children investigated for child maltreatment. The sample consisted of 5496 children aged 0 to 15 years at baseline. For analysis, descriptive statistics was used to determine special health care needs and children's functioning from baseline to 3-year follow-up. Logistic regression was used to examine correlates of special health care needs.

# Special Health Care Needs (SHCNs) in Child Welfare System:

- Thirty percent to 60% of children in foster care have been estimated to have chronic health conditions. When behavioral, emotional, and developmental concerns are taken into consideration, the estimated proportion of foster children with serious health care needs jumps to ⬎80%.
- Meeting the needs of such children requires the coordination of community-based systems of care. For many children with SHCNs, the child welfare system (CWS) plays a critical role in this coordinated service array.
- To effectively coordinate care for children's SHCNs in the CWS population, we must know how frequently SHCNs occur, which children are most at risk for them, and how these needs may affect children's development and functioning.
- Adopted and foster care children may be at increased risk because of a greater prevalence of biological or environmental risk factors. These children may also be more likely than others to have their needs identified or reported because of health screenings provided by CWS or because adoptive and foster parents may be more alert to health conditions and better able to access pediatric care than other caregivers.


## Occurrence of SHCNs:

  - Caregivers reported that 50.3% of the children had less than or equal to 1 SHCN at some point during the 3-year study period.
  - At baseline, 35.1% of children were reported to have had SHCNs. Thirty-one percent were reported to have had SHCNs at the 1.5-year follow-up, and 33.5% were reported to have had SHCNs at the 3.0-year follow-up.
  - Boys were significantly more likely than girls to have had SHCNs, and children aged 0 to 2 years at baseline were significantly less likely to have had SHCNs than older children.
  - Adopted and foster children were significantly more likely to have had SHCNs than children in other living arrangements.
  - Overall, 56.1% of children with either form of SHCN had 1 or less than 1 of the 7 developmental problems
  - Especially high rates of SHCNs in this target population seem to stem from the preponderance of developmental and behavioral needs. Children in the CWS show much higher rates of special needs than children in the general US population.
  - Our data suggest that the children with SHCNs in this sample were at substantially high risk for a variety of cognitive and behavioral impairments.
-
## Recommendations regarding SHCNs:

  - The early identification of SHCNs may offer the opportunity to foster positive functioning or simultaneously identify co-occurring problems.
  - The findings regarding gender, age, and poverty resemble those of van Dyck et al and Newacheck et al, although these studies found significant differences by race and ethnicity that were not found in our study.
  - Previous studies have found high rates of SHCNs among children placed in out-of-home care. This study supports previous findings that children with a history of out-of-home placement (adopted and foster care) are at particular risk for both chronic health problems and special needs

# Two main types of SHCNs:

NSCAW includes 2 indicators of SHCNs: 
- the presence of a chronic health condition and the presence of special needs
- These children who have a special health care need are also at an increased risk for chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional conditions requiring extensive health and related services. The two main types of Special health care needs are:

### Chronic health Conditions:

  - As for chronic health conditions, 27.9% of children had ever had one. children aged 0 to 2 years at baseline were significantly more likely to have had a chronic health condition than children aged 6 to 10 years at baseline.
  - Children with a chronic health condition were significantly more likely than children without SHCNs to have a score in the clinical range in the cognitive, adaptive, behavioral, social skill, and maths and reading areas.
  - Overall, 53.5% of children with chronic health conditions had a problem in less than or equal to 1 of these areas compared with 29.1% of children without SHCNs.
  -
### Common Chronic health issues:

- The most commonly reported condition was asthma (8.0% and 8.5% at any given point). Overall, 12.8% of all of the children were reported to have had the condition over the course of 3 years.
    - A recent national study estimated that 13% of all children (younger than age 18 years) had at some point in their lives suffered from asthma
    - Other conditions less frequently reported over the course of 3 years included repeated ear infections (5.2%), other respiratory problems (4.7%), severe allergies (4.2%), epilepsy (1.9%), and eczema or other skin disease (2.0%).

### Special Needs:

  - As reported by caregivers, 33.2% of children had a special need either currently or in the past. There were significant differences in having a special need by gender, age, poverty, and living arrangement.
  - Boys were significantly more likely than girls to have a special need, and children aged 0 to 2 years at baseline were significantly less likely to have a special need, compared with every other age group.
  - Children living at or below the poverty level at baseline were significantly more likely than children living above the poverty level at baseline to have had a special need.
  - Finally, adopted and foster children were more likely than children living at home to have had special needs
  - Children with a special need were significantly more likely than children without SHCNs to have any of the developmental problems. More than half (50.7%) of the children with special needs had a clinically significant score for behavioral problems.
  - Overall, 62.8% of children with special needs had less than or equal to 1 of these developmental problems compared with 29.1% of children without an SHCN..
  -
### Common Special Needs:

- The most common special need was a learning disability (10.4% and 13.7% at any given point). Overall, 20.6% of all of the children had learning disabilities over the course of 3 years.
    - Other commonly reported conditions over the 3-year study period included 14.1% of children with emotional disturbance, 12.3% with speech impairment, 2.4% with mental retardation, 2.0% with hearing impairment, 1.3% with autism, and 1.2% with vision impairment.

# Measures used for assessing SHCNs: [[Assessment Tools]]

## For Demographic information:

  - Caregivers were asked about their child's gender, child's age, child's race/ethnicity, family income, and number of adults and children in the household. Family income and number of adults and children in the household were used to determine at baseline poverty level according to the US Census Bureau guidelines
  -
### Child's living arrangements:

At each follow-up, a child's current living arrangement was obtained from caregivers or from caseworkers if necessary. If the caregiver or the caseworker reported that the child was at some point placed out of home, then the child was coded as &quot;yes&quot; for having an out-of-home placement history. At the final follow-up, children were currently classified as one of the following

- living in-home with biological parents or other pre investigation caregivers, with no out-of-home placement history
- living at home with biological parents or other pre investigation caregivers with an out-of-home placement history
- living at home with adoptive parents (among adopted children, only 29 children were never placed out of home
- living in kinship care (children cared for by relatives, including grandmothers, sisters, and aunts, including 58 children who were never placed out of the home of their kin
- living in foster care. Children lacking 3-year follow-up data on living arrangements were classified from the most recent follow-up period with available data.


## Indicators for Chronic health conditions and Special Needs:

NSCAW includes 2 indicators of SHCNs: the presence of a chronic health condition and the presence of special needs. Each of these indicators is based on a caregiver report.

### Chronic Health Conditions: 
- At each interview, caregivers were asked whether their child had any health problems that last a long time or come back again and again. If yes, caregivers were asked to name them. Caregivers could report ⬎1 problem. For the chronic health condition questions, the wording denoted a chronic health condition prevalent at the time of the interview
  -
### Special Needs: 
- At each interview, caregivers were asked if they had ever been told by an educational or health professional, or told since the last interview, that their child has &quot;learning problems, special needs or developmental disabilities. 
- If yes to either of these questions, caregivers were asked to describe these problems. The special needs questions in NSCAW were designed to correspond with disability categories under the Individuals With Disabilities Act.


## Assessing Maltreatment characteristics:

  - The most serious type of maltreatment was assessed by asking the caseworkers the following question in the baseline interview: Of the types of abuse or neglect that were reported, please tell me the type that you felt was the most serious (physical maltreatment, sexual maltreatment, emotional maltreatment, physical neglect (failure to provide), neglect (lack of supervision), abandonment, moral/legal maltreatment, educational maltreatment, exploitation, and other)
  - For the majority of children, the main type of maltreatment was neglect (lack of supervision: 25.2%; failure to provide: 18.0%), followed by physical abuse (25.2%).
  -
### Substantiation:

- Substantiation denotes the official decision of the CWS service that the maltreatment allegations are valid. Caseworkers indicated whether the evidence of maltreatment was substantiated, indicated, or neither substantiated or indicated. 
- It indicates is a case disposition used in some states when the caseworker judges that evidence of maltreatment exists but not enough to substantiate the allegation. Only when caseworkers chose the response option substantiated were children classified as such.
    - Most children's cases were not substantiated (73.8%). At the 3-year follow-up or at the time of the last contact, almost three fourths of the children had never been placed out of the home, and no other living-arrangement category included ⬎9.9% of the children

-
## Assessing Child Functioning:

- Data on child functioning came from the field representative's direct assessment of the child at the 3-year follow-up in 6 areas: cognitive development, language, adaptation, behavior, social skills, and academic problems.

  -
### Battelle Developmental Inventory:

- To measure cognitive development, NSCAW used the cognitive domain of the Battelle Developmental Inventory, which assesses perceptual discrimination, memory, reasoning, academic skills, and conceptual development for children 0 to 4 years old

  
### Kaufmann Brief Intelligence Test:

- The Kaufmann Brief Intelligence Test was used for children below or equal to 4 years of age. It is a brief, individually administered measure of verbal and nonverbal intelligence. We used the standard score for vocabulary, matrices, and total IQ composite.

  
### Preschool Language Scale:

- The Preschool Language Scale-3 was used to measure language development for children ⱕ6 years, 11 months old. 
- The auditory comprehension subscale measures receptive communication skills; the expressive communication subscale measures expressive communication skills with tasks that focus on social communication and vocal development.
- A total language score combines these 2 subscales.

  
### Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale Screener:

- NSCAW used the daily living skills items from the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale Screener to measure adaptive problems. These items assess personal care skills (eg, how the child eats), domestic skills (eg, how the child performs household tasks), and community skills (eg, child's knowledge of safety).


### Child Behavior Checklist &amp; Teacher's Report Format:

NSCAW used the Child Behavior Checklist and Teacher's checklist  Report Form to measure behavioral problems.30 checklists are designed to assess children's social competencies and problem behaviors


### Social Skills Rating System (SSRS):

NSCAW used the Social Skills Rating System (SSRS) to measure caregiver perception of the social skills of children between the ages of 3 and 18 years.32 Separate versions have been developed for preschool, elementary school, and secondary school. The SSRS assesses social skills in 4 domains (cooperation, assertion, responsibility, and self-control) and provides standard scores for the total and individual domains.

### Woodcock-McGrew-Werder Mini-Battery of Achievement:

The reading and maths subtests of the WoodcockMcGrew-Werder Mini-Battery of Achievement were used to assess academic problems of children aged equal to or less than 6 years.

# Learnings from the study:

## Data Collection:

- The data to determine SHCNs came from caregivers reports, not medical charts; consequently, they do not necessarily correspond with medical diagnoses, or they may be subject to response and recall bias.


## Incorrect estimation of the prevalence of SHCNs:

- A second limitation concerns ways we may be underestimating the rate of SHCNs in the population of children involved in CWS investigations. 
	- First, some caregivers may have had limited insight into their children's health problems and special needs; 
	- second, the definition of SHCNs used in our study is more restrictive than the MCHB definition, which is a critical issue in the estimation of prevalence


## Time reference periods:

- The third limitation of this study stems from the time reference periods used in the NSCAW SHCN questions. In NSCAW follow-up interviews, caregivers were asked to identify special needs arising only since the previous interview period.It is, therefore, possible that caregivers failed to report a special need at a follow-up wave if they had reported it previously, even if the child still had the special need.
