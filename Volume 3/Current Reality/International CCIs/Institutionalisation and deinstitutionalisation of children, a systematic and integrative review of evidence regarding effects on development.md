# Brief:

- Scope & Description:  The lack of consensus on how to interpret the evidence relating to the size, range, and persistence of the effect of institutional care on the development and wellbeing of children has led to disagreement as to whether policy should focus on eliminating, transforming, or improving institutions. This paper attempts to fill this gap by reviewing the literature on institutionalisation and deinstitutionalisation of children from a global perspective including a systematic review and meta-analysis of developmental sequelae. It was found that there is negative associations between institutional care and children’s development, especially in relation to physical growth, cognition, and attention. Significant but smaller associations were found between institutionalisation and socioemotional development and mental health. Reducing the number of children entering institutions and increasing the number leaving institutions is urgently needed.

# Introduction

* Millions of children grow up in publicly or privately managed and staffed residential facilities (referred here as institutions) that do not provide a child with a family environment and whose quality varies greatly. 
* The poor quality standards and frequent maltreatment mean that even when basic sanitary conditions are adequate and nutritional needs are met, social and cognitive aspects of institutional care are often of low quality and are inconsistently delivered.
* The review deals with two questions:
    * does growing up in institutions disrupt or delay physical, neural, cognitive or socioemotional development and negatively affect mental health;
    * and, when this disruption occurs, does leaving an institution and being placed in family­based care (ie, deinstitutionalisation) promote developmental recovery or catch­up, either partially or completely?
* For the purposes of this Commission, we define an institution as a publicly or privately managed and staffed collective living arrangement for children that is not family based. 
* These institutions include orphanages, children’s institutions, group homes, infant homes, children’s villages, and similar residential settings for children. Forensic or therapeutic care settings are excluded from this Commission.
* The Bucharest Early Intervention Project (BEIP)6 is the only study to use a randomised controlled design to study the benefits of deinstitutionalisation. 
* Following an extensive baseline assessment, 68 of the 136 children in institutions (aged 6–31 months) were randomly assigned to a high­quality foster care programme that was developed and financed by the investigators.7 The other 68 children were randomly assigned to care as usual, which initially meant that these children remained in institutional care.
* The strategy of this study was to set the BEIP findings apart and compare them with the broader pattern of meta­analytical results relating to the benefits of deinstitutionalisation.
* Where the findings from the BEIP align with those of quasi­experimental and naturalistic observational studies of the association between institutionalisation and outcomes (especially where the findings show a dose–response relationship), this contributes to our confidence in drawing inferences about the causal links between these two things.

# Section 1: historical and cultural context

* Throughout most of history, children deprived of parental care were most often cared for by extended kinship networks—a practice that persists in much of the world.
* Kafalah, for example, is practised in many Muslim communities to allow children to be cared for in a family outside their biological family, without a change in kinship status.
* One of the first large institutions for infants, Santa Maria degl’Innocenti, was founded in 1445 in response to the problem of child abandonment.
* European cities and in the colonies of European powers over subsequent centuries. However, despite the compassionate intent of their founders, mortality within institutional care settings was 50–70% through to the early 20th century12–16 because of unsanitary conditions and poor nutrition, among other factors.
* High mortality within institutions and emerging evidence of developmental harm21–25 instigated the transition from an institution­based to a family­based social welfare system in the USA and western Europe.
* Institutionalisation of children increased substantially in eastern Europe and what was the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) after the 1917 Russian Revolution and World War 2, because of high numbers of displaced and abandoned children and the insufficient development of alternatives such as fostering and adoption.
* In China, child institutionalisation expanded substantially after the adoption of the one child policy in 1979.
* Reviews of institutional practices confirmed that the closed environment and frequent absence of robust safeguarding policies and practices inherent in many forms of institutional care, combined with other features of low­quality care, had placed children at risk of severe physical or sexual abuse, violation of fundamental human rights, trafficking for sex or labour, exploitation through orphan tourism, and risk to health and wellbeing after being subjected to medical experimentation.
* In response, global multilateral and bilateral institutions such as the UN, the EU, the US Agency for International Development, and many non governmental organisations are promoting reforms to reduce reliance on institutions for children by strengthening birth, kinship, adoptive, kafalah, and foster families.

# Section 2: Global characterisation

* The number of children entering institutions
    * According to UNICEF, an orphan is a child younger than 18 years who has lost one or both parents to any cause of death.
    * A 2009 study of 21 countries in sub­Saharan Africa on HIV and AIDS and orphan status found children with no living parent constituted a minority (13·5%) of all orphans in the region.
    * The same study found that of the children with no living parent who resided in households (not institutions), around two­thirds were living with grand parents; the remainder were living with other adults.
    * A systematic review of data from 137 countries estimated that 5·09–6·10 million children were living in institutions worldwide in 2015 using the imputation methods with the smallest root­mean­squared error, but this estimate was qualified by the absence of a standard definition of an institution and the reliability of some of the underlying data.
    * Regardless of how many children are living in institutions, this number is highly likely to have increased over the past three decades because of the HIV crisis, humanitarian emergencies, and the increased interest of private financial donors in funding the creation and operation of institutions.
* Factors that cause children to be placed in institutions
    * Despite institutions often being described as orphanages, studies show that 80–90% of children residing in them have a living parent. 
    * Poverty is often cited as the main reason for institutional placement, along with access to health care and education. However, the majority of poor families do not place their children in institutions, and more complex causes are involved, such as the social marginalisation that can accompany childbearing outside of marriage.
    * Emergencies and disasters can also lead to a child being placed in an institution on the assumption that they were orphaned, even though they might not have been.
    * Child abuse within families is not cited as a common reason for placement in institutions in lower income countries, but is more so in higher income settings.
    * In summary, the entry of children into institutions is the result of multiple drivers, such as poverty, parental mental health problems, disability, or parental death from disease. Cultural factors might also have a role in the placement of children in institutions, as is the case when children are born outside of marriage to young mothers in some societies. Very few children worldwide have access to professional case management during placement decisions.
    * Child and family participation in decisions concerning care arrangements is an important element of social work assessment and referral, and is a principle of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
    * Characteristics of institutions
    * Institutions vary by size, staffing, region, purpose, and funder.
    * One study distinguished between globally depriving institutions (ie, ten to 30 children per caregiver) and psychosocially depriving institutions (ie, three to six children per caregiver). Published data are scarce but generally confirm that staff­to­child ratios in most institutions studied are globally depriving according to these criteria.
    * Institutions that are globally depriving also have high staff turnover, employ staff with little training, have poor caregiver–child interactions, and often segregate children with disabilities or other health problems. Deficits in nutrition and hormonal growth suppression contribute to psychosocial growth problems in institutions, especially in the early years of develop ment.
* Funding and cost-effectiveness
    * Institutions in the former states of the USSR, central and eastern Europe, and China are usually state owned.
    * In other regions, such as sub Saharan Africa, most institutions are privately owned, often by non­governmental or faith­based organisations.
    * The few data available suggest that institutions are less cost­effective than foster care. For example, statutory residential care in South Africa costs more than 8 times as much per month as does home­based support providing for basic needs.
* The number of children leaving institutions
    * Children enter a variety of caregiving environments following deinstitutionalisation, including return to birth family or kinship networks, foster care, kafalah, domestic and intercountry adoption, and ageing out into adult society. Although no global sources of data exist on the number of children leaving institutions each year, some national data are available.
    * Reports of reductions in institutions need to be interpreted carefully. From 2010 to 2015, Russia reorganised one in four of its residential institutions for children—eg, by converting the institutions into boarding schools.
    * A substantial challenge in promoting deinstitutionalisation and closing institutions is that, whether privately or publicly funded, institutions often have large local populations of people who are dependent on the existence of the institution for employment, and who support the continuation of the facility. These institutions are often in remote areas where jobs are scarce.

# Section 3: the effects of institutionalisation and deinstitutionalisation on development

* In the past 65 years, more than 300 quantitative studies have been done across more than 60 countries on the development of children raised in institutions (figure 2).
* We did a systematic review and meta­analysis of the data from these studies and examined a broad range of developmental sequelae of institutional care and deinstitutionalisation covering the quantitative studies from the past 7 decades.
* We addressed two main questions. First, is growing up in an institution detrimental to development compared with growing up in a biological, kinship, foster, or adoptive family? To answer this question, we compared the development of children placed in institutions for reasons other than their own disability or mental health problems to that of their peers growing up in a family, or to standard norms derived from typically developing peers. 
* Second, does deinstitutionalisation lead to recovery or catch up—ie, change for the better after the transition from the institution to a more family­like environment? 
* Our comparison of the effects of deinstitutionalisation shown in the meta­analysis with the effects shown in the BEIP (which compared continuing institutional care vs foster care groups at 144 months of age following the end of the trial at 54 months of age) was designed to examine, where possible, the convergence of the meta­analytical estimates of deinstitutionalisation with the causal findings of a randomised trial.
* The effect of institutionalisation: Meta-analytical results
    * In 80% of the studies we analysed, the effects of institutionalisation were assessed by comparing children in institutions with norm groups (eg, with average anthropometric growth curves) or children living with their biological parents; in 20% of the studies, the comparisons were made with adopted children, with children living in foster families, or with children living in kinship care.
    * The meta­analysis found that residency in an institution is associated with substantial developmental delays and deviations (table 1; figure 3).
    * Institutionalisation is strongly associated with delays in physical growth, brain development, cognitive development, and attention, with combined effects sizes (Hedges’ g) ranging from 0·50 to 1·44.
    * The combined effect sizes for physical health (0·29) and socioemotional development (0·32) are smaller.
    * Thus, the greatest effects on children were delayed physical growth (height and weight for age) and delayed brain and cognitive development, to the extent that in these developmental domains at least 80% of the institutionalised group are below the mean of the comparisons.
    * The more modest effect sizes for institutionalisation in the domains of physical health and socioemotional development might be partly explained by measurement issues.
    * First, in several studies the assessments were done many months to years after the children left the institution, potentially diluting the effects of institu tionalisation with postinstitutional experiences.
    * Studies assessing the children’s physical health within a year after leaving an institution showed substantial adverse effects (Hedges’ g 0·63).
    * Of note, dental health was included as part of the measurement of physical health in some studies and was sometimes better in children in institutions than in their peers who had not lived in an institution.
    * An important limitation is that most of the studies of socioemotional development (including mental health) used standard parent or caregiver questionnaires not designed to measure social deficits thought to be specific to children living in institutions.
    * The smaller effects on socioemotional development might also reflect children in institutions having learnt not to express emotion because of the oppressive and neglectful regimes under which these children often live.
    * The results might therefore underestimate the amount of disorder in children who have left institutions.
    * To evaluate the effect of institutionalisation on attachment, we compared the distribution of attachment within institutions to the normative distribution in typically developing children growing up in birth families.
    * Only a few children developed a secure attachment relationship with the closest caregiver within the institution.
    * In 11 studies including 471 children (figure 6), the proportion of securely attached children in institutions (24%) was significantly lower than the normative proportion (62%; Hedges’ g 0·76).
    * The effects of institutionalisation on growth and development might vary as a function of age of assessment, which ranged from infancy to adolescence.
    * The largest delays for physical growth and for cognitive development emerge in infancy and early childhood up to age 42 months (table 1; figure 3).
    * By contrast, attention problems tend to increase with age, possibly because executive attention generally develops later, so problems might be difficult to detect in early childhood.
    * In terms of cognitive and socioemotional development and attention, boys had more delays than girls after growing up in institutions. Girls had more delays in physical health.
* Comparison with the Bucharest Early Intervention Project
    * Compared with the meta­analytical results, delays in cognitive development are more pronounced in the BEIP. The BEIP and the meta­analysis showed similar results for the other developmental domains (overlapping 95% CIs are shown in table 1), and this convergence of non experimental results with the experimental results contributes to the robustness of our meta­analytical findings.
* Benefits of deinstitutionalisation: Meta-analytical results
    * Children show initial signs of rapid improvement following deinstitutionalisation. To examine these signs in our meta­analysis, we defined accelerated development after institutional care (catch­up following deinstitutionalisation) as the change between the earliest and the latest post institutionalisation assessments within a study (table 3; figure 4).
    * Physical growth showed a catch­up of 1 SD after deinstitutionalisation (Hedges’ g 1·05; 95% CI 0·67–1·43; figure 4).
    * Substantial recovery because of deinstitutionalisation was also found for brain growth as inferred by changes in head circumference (0·97; 0·45–1·49) and cognitive development(0·57; 0·23–0·91).
    * A recovery in children’s socioemotional problems after deinstitution alisation seemed largely absent.
    * the English and Romanian Adoptees study91 found evidence for strong persistence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder through to early adulthood.
    * Accelerated development after exiting the institution might represent a short­term catchup at the expense of delayed development at a later developmental stage.
    * Children who have had extended deprivation can develop secure attachments with their new parents from adoption or foster placements, even after being exposed to severe deprivation.
* Benefits of deinstitutionalisation: Comparison with the Bucharest Early Intervention Project
    * The effects of deinstitutionalisation in the BEIP (continuing institutional care vs foster care groups at age 144 months) and the meta analytical estimates (table 3) were similar for all developmental domains as evident from overlapping 95% CIs.
    * Foster care did not lead to improvements in all domains (eg, head circumference), and of those domains that did improve, some were affected by the age of the child when they were placed in foster care (these ages were interpreted by the investigators as being sensitive periods of development: see section 4 for details about these periods) and some were not (figures 3 and 6). 
    * Furthermore, in many of the domains that did show an intervention effect, children in foster care rarely did as well as children who had never been institutionalised.
    * Whether this absence of full remediation reflects late age at placement (ie, average age at placement was about 22 months) or sample bias (eg, are children who were abandoned by their parents different from children who were not abandoned) is unclear.
    * The convergence of the correlational meta analytical results and the experimental BEIP findings is reassuring for both the internal validity of the metaanalytical results (potential confounders do not seem to dominate the meta analytical outcome) as well as the external validity of the BEIP results. The convergence reciprocally supports both approaches.
* Robustness of the meta-analytical findings
    * The robustness of the meta­analytical results was examined with meta regression, the trim and fill method,76,77 Egger’s regression test for potential publication bias, and bootstrapping to test the influence of potential outlying values.
    * Taken together, these tests did not support a large influence of non published reports and findings, although we only systematically searched for dissertations as a component of the grey literature.

## Section 4: Accounting for individual variations in the sequelae of institutional care

* The developmental sequelae of institutional care are well established. However, as is the case for exposure to, and escape from, other putatively adverse circumstances, a child’s response to institutionalisation and deinstitutionalisation will differ between individuals.
* Under standing the source of such variation can help to improve care after a child leaves an institution and to drive therapeutic innovation for individuals with institution related impairment and disorder.
* In this section, we identify contextual (institutional and postinstitutional) and child characteristics (vulnerability and resilience) that are associated with such variation.
* Preinstitutional context
    * This preinstitutional exposure to risks represents a substantial confounder in estimates of the effects of subsequent exposures.
    * These preinstitutional risks include prenatal and postnatal exposures and events, although postnatal effects can be ruled out in many studies because children enter institutions soon after birth.
    * However, data on these factors are rarely available or controlled for in studies of the subsequent effects of institutional care on development.
* Contextual variations within institutions: Duration and timing of institutional care
    * Many studies have reported a relationship between the duration of institutionalisation and both the severity of adverse outcomes and the scale of recovery observed after deinstitutionalisation.
    * We found a dose–response association, with longer stays in the institution predicting larger developmental delays and deviations.
    * Physical growth showedthe most dramatic dose–response relationship longer duration predicted more delayed growth (Hedges’ g 0·95; 95% CI 0·53–1·36; figure 5).
    * The effect sizes for most other developmental domains were significant but smaller than for growth. These results converged with the BEIP effect sizes at age 42 months, comparing children who had remained in an institution with children who had been randomly assigned to foster care and thus spent less than 42 months in institutionalised care.
    * At age 42 months, children in institutions showed delays in physical growth (Hedges’ g 0·52; 95% CI 0·13 to 0·91) and cognitive development (0·62; 0·24 to 1·00), and an increase in atypical socioemotional development (0·46; 0·07 to 0·84; figure 5).
    * Brain growth as assessed by head circumference (0·24; –0·29 to 0·52) and attention (0·18; –0·19 to 0·54; figure 5) were not different between children remaining in institutions and their peers who had transited into foster care.
    * The clearest example of the relationship between duration of deprivation and the scale of postinstitutional recovery comes from the English and Romanian Adoptees study. In this study, even after 20 years in adoptive homes, children who had extended institutional care showed significantly elevated prevalence of autism spectrum disorder, attention­deficit hyperactivity disorder, and disinhibited social engagement symptoms.
    * Children exposed to shorter durations of institutional care were largely indistinguishable from the non­deprived adoptive control group.
    * This difference between children exposed to extended or short periods of institutional care was already established by the age of 6 years.
    * The relationship between exposure and out come is probabilistic in nature. By contrast, we define critical periods as being times during development when exposure to specific experiences (or an absence of experiences) leads to inevitable and permanent negative outcomes.
    * Such exposures might not be necessary for poor outcomes, but are sufficient (all children exposed will be affected), which has not been observed in the institutionalisation studies reviewed here.
    * Few studies ran the necessary analyses to test for non linear relationships between duration and timing of institutional care and outcomes, so these relationships could not be addressed using meta­analysis.
    * However, evidence from individual studies shows that exposures of a specific duration during infancy might be necessary (but not sufficient) for negative outcomes to occur, suggesting a sensitive period instead of a critical period.
    * these studies suggest that age 6–24 months constitutes an especially sensitive period for the effects of institutional care.
    * However, in the BEIP, several outcomes were significantly less affected—although not unaffected—in children who spent less than 24 months in institutions than in children who were institutionalised for more than 24 months.
    * Children might have a greater capacity for recovery if removed from institutional care in infancy.
    * Although the specific age at exposure to an institution and the duration of that exposure vary between studies, taken together, the results suggest that the earlier in life children are removed from adverse caregiving environments, the more likely they are to recover and the fuller their recovery is likely to be.
* Contextual variations within institutions: Care quality
    * Institutional quality is affected by structural staffing differences and care practices. A meta­analysis of the effects of these factors was not possible because only a few studies provided relevant systematic measurement.
    * However, a qualitative review supports an association between care quality or extent of deprivation and developmental outcomes.
    * Negative developmental outcomes might be less common in children who had higher quality care.
    * The link between care quality and outcomes is shown by a quasi­experiment by the St Petersburg–USA Orphanage Research Team.
    * The investigators directly compared outcomes of young children in three Russian baby homes in which these structural staffing changes and caregiver training were manipulated in a quasi­experimental design.
    * The intervention showed that care that is more stable and supportive enhances children’s physical, cognitive, and socioemotional development, both while the children are in institutional care and when they are adopted into families.
    * Strikingly, growth benefits were observed without any change in diet.
    * Both retrospective and prospective studies have indicated that being a favourite child or having a preferred attachment figure in an institution is associated with less indiscriminate social behaviour.
    * Subnutrition (defined as a bodyweight of 1·5 SDs below the expected norm) in institutions has been studied indirectly by using weight at the time of removal from institutions as an index.
    * For example, in the English and Romanian Adoptee study, even among infants with less than 6 months of exposure to deprivation, subnutrition was associated with head circumferences that were nearly 3 SDs below the mean at age 6 years.
    * Infants with no subnutrition who left institutions before the age of 6 months showed no significant reduction in head growth. 
* Postinstitutional influences: Parent and family resources
    * The degree and rate of recovery after deinstitutionalisation and the ultimate level of functioning that children have might be affected by characteristics of the receiving families.
    * As in many aspects of child development, the education of the parents and the family income and access to resources might have an important role, with maternal education, family income, and the stability of the family structure predicting educational outcomes.
    * However, unrealistic expectations for achievement in families of high social status might undermine their adoptive children’s self­confidence and negatively affect the mental health of these children.1
* Postinstitutional influences: Quality of postinstitutional care
    * The type of postinstitutional placement might also affect children’s socioemotional and cognitive development.
    * For example, in the BEIP, investigators compared one group of children living in BEIP­sponsored foster families who had benefited from specialised training and support with another group of children placed with government­sponsored foster parents who came forward as part of child protection reform efforts.
    * After controlling for duration of time spent in foster care, children in the BEIP foster group at 54 months of age had fewer symptoms of attention­deficit hyperactivity disorder and, in girls only, fewer symptoms of internalising problems.1
* Postinstitutional influences: Individual differences in parenting
    * Children adopted internationally often become an ethnic or racial minority in another culture with two parents from the majority racial and ethnic group.
    * Among adolescent adoptees, more positive engagement in the family and higher amounts of maternal control were associated with the family acknowledging the importance of racial and ethnic differences and constructing a multiracial or multiethnic family identity.
    * Aspects of parenting quality also influence outcomes for deinstitutionalised children.
    * the use of mental state language by parents predicts the development of emotional understanding in children who have been deinstitutionalised.
* Child-related factors: Genetic factors
    * Several studies of candidate genes for specific disorders have shown that genetic variations might affect the susceptibility of a child to both negative effects of institutional care and positive responses to placement in a supportive family.
    * For example, children living in institutions who have the short allele of the 5-HTT gene (SLC6A4; index of a broader genetic pathway leading to susceptibility to the effects of environmental exposures) are more likely than children without this allele to show emotional problems generally,124 and socially indiscriminate behaviour specifically.
* Child-related factors: Child characteristics
    * The developmental status of a child at the time of their placement in a family after institutional care might influence the recovery trajectory of that child.
    * Few studies have tried to quantify the extent to which individual variations in characteristics at the time of placement in a family determine medium­term to long­term outcomes.
    * A relationship has been found between physiological dysregulation linked to the effects of institutional care and functioning after removal from the institution.


# Conclusion

* We found compelling evidence that institutional care is associated with negative developmental outcomes. The negative effects are greatest with regard to physical growth (including brain growth as indexed by head circumference) and cognition, and are strong in relation to attention problems (eg, attention­deficit hyperactivity disorder).
* Effects appear to vary as a function of the type of institutional care—ie, its duration and quality—with the suggestion that children aged 6–24 months are especially susceptible to the effects of institutional care.
* Evidence of catch­up or recovery following deinstitutionalisation has been shown, although many affected children do not show full catch­up, especially children with extended deprivation.
* Despite this, many children who have left institutions adapt reasonably well. Given the corroboration of observational results by data from the BEIP randomised controlled trial data, evidence for the causal benefits of deinstitutionalisation is quite strong
* Nevertheless, meta analytical estimates converged with the findings of the only experimental trial in this field, the BEIP,6 which controlled for potential differences between children in institutions using random assignment to foster care or prolonged institutionalisation. More experimental and quasi­experimental studies are needed that make creative use of alternative approaches, such as propensity score matching, instrumental variables, or Mendelian experiments, to broaden the evidence base.
* In general, we suggest that the evidence presented here underestimates rather than overestimates the effect of institutionalisation and deinstitutionalisation on children’s development.
* In particular, the commonly used instruments might not capture some of the unique effects of institutional care, and typical outcomes such as quasi­autism and indiscriminate social behaviours are often not systematically assessed.
* The average effect of institutionalisation is an underestimation for some children and an overestimation for other children.13
* Not all children are affected to the same extent, and which individual factors make them more or less susceptible to the negative effect of institutional care needs further investigation.
* The policy Commission has two core propositions: that children’s exposure to institutionalised living should be avoided completely if possible, or minimised if not, and that to achieve this first proposition, extended kinship families need to be supported where possible, and adoptive or stable foster­family care should be supported where necessary.
