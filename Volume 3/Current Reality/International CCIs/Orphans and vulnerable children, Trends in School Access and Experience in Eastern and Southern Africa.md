# Brief:
* Scope & Description: The paper examines access to schooling and educational experiences of orphan youth, moving from a macro lens—analyses of household survey data, to a micro-lens—an in-depth secondary school survey and an ethnographic study. It appears that orphanhood itself is an inadequate measure of vulnerability that does little to describe the complexity of challenges facing children in eastern and southern Africa. The paper also points to the need for an expanded definition of child vulnerability that encompasses all children whose lives are affected by the AIDS pandemic.

## Literature review of studies of orphanhood and schooling in sub-Saharan Africa: 


### Key findings:

* parental death may be an inadequate indicator of educational disadvantage
* orphans do have systematically lower educational outcomes than non-orphans, the significance of the relationship tends to be minimal after controlling for socioeconomic status
* Poverty, in general, appears to be a more important indicator of an educational disadvantage than orphanhood in particular, although they appear to be interrelated.
* a review of DHS (Demographic and Health Surveys) data from 11 eastern and southern African countries, found that-
    * household wealth
    * gender
    * region of residence  are all more important predictors of school outcomes than the orphan status
* A review of over 100 datasets from 51 countries around the globe, including 35 in sub-Saharan Africa, found that, in the majority of countries, the size of the orphan enrollment gap is much smaller than the gap in enrollment between children from different socio-economic backgrounds.
* data from DHS surveys across seven sub-Saharan African countries, and found that the characteristics of the household head, and the standard of living in the household where the child resides, were more important determinants of school enrollment and completion than whether the child was living with both parents
* evidence demonstrates that, in the African context, family support networks are so strong that they tend to mitigate the impact of orphanhood on the life chances of children
* Qualitative studies tend to support the finding that orphans face barriers to educational participation that are different from those of non-orphans, including stigma and frequent migration between households.


## Need for an expanded definition of child vulnerability:
* Many children whose parents are still alive are faced with responsibilities such as caring for sick relatives and working to support their families or may become targets of abuse and discrimination.
* Vulnerability is difficult to define in practice, and despite a global commitment to the more inclusive definition of orphans and vulnerable children, policies still tend to single out orphans for services.


## Methodology:

This study takes a multifaceted approach, combining quantitative analyses of:

* household survey data from five countries
    * The household survey component of the study is based on data from ten Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in southern and eastern African countries between 2001 and 2010.
* a student survey administered in Lesotho, with the quantitative data on student attendance and retention patterns in primary and secondary school
    * The Lesotho student survey was conducted in Lesotho in 2010
    * The survey was administered to 550 students in 10 schools across Lesotho and saw a 99 percent response rate. 
    * The schools were randomly selected from the total system of secondary schools in Lesotho, and are intended to be generally representative of average schools in the system at large
* as well as data on secondary school experiences in Lesotho in the context of an ethnographic study conducted by Smiley (2011) in Lesotho secondary schools.


## Primary education trends:
Data was collected by the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for five countries- Lesotho, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia, in order to determine the extent of orphanhood among primary-aged school children in these countries. 


## General background
* The percentage of primary-aged children who are orphans, defined as having lost one or both parents, ranges from 13 percent in Tanzania to 33 percent in Lesotho.
* A comparison of multi-year household survey data suggests that the magnitude of orphanhood did not change significantly in the past several years, with the largest difference between the two surveys observed in Malawi (a 4% point decline over 6 years).
* The percentage of orphans among children of primary-school-age children does not differ considerably between rural and urban areas.


## Attendance

* School attendance among orphans has slightly increased (with the exception of Tanzania) and remains at a relatively high level.
* over 80 percent of both female and male orphans of primary school age attend school, with female orphans demonstrating slightly higher attendance rates in all cases.
* Across the data set, the lowest total net attendance rates were observed in Zambia in 2002, though Zambia has seen the largest improvement in primary school enrollment rates for orphans among the five countries. 
* Overall, the number of primary-aged orphans who are out of school ranges from 18 percent in Tanzania to 5 percent in Lesotho.


## Net intake rate and gross intake rate
* Even though school attendance rates for orphans appear to be high, an analysis of gross and intake rates to Grade 1 suggests that many orphans in the five analyzed countries enroll later than the official Grade 1 age for the country.
* The difference between the net intake rate and gross intake rate demonstrates the extent to which orphans in Grade 1 of primary school are overage. The gap between the overall level of enrollment and age-appropriate enrollment is lower for female orphans, indicating that they are more likely to attend school on time than males, with the exception of Zambia.


## Key findings from primary education trends:

* the proportions of orphans attending primary school are fairly high, they are also not substantially different from school access statistics for non-orphan children.


#### Attendance

* In all countries, it was found that net attendance rates for the two groups are within two percentage points of each other.
* Primary gross attendance rates are nearly equal for orphans and non-orphans in three countries (Malawi, Tanzania, and Zambia), but in two others (Lesotho and Uganda), primary gross attendance by orphans is higher than that for non-orphans.
* These data suggest that, among children who are of the correct age for primary school, orphaned children are just as likely to be attending primary school as non-orphaned children.
* However, primary schools in Lesotho and Uganda also include significant populations of orphans who are older than the official age for their grades.
	* Possible explanations for a large population of overage students in the school system
		* Older orphaned children who had not previously attended school are now at an older age
		* Orphans are entering primary school on time but are repeating grades more often, and aging within the system.


#### Repeating a grade
* Once in school, orphans actually appear to be equally or less likely to repeat a grade than non-orphans


#### Drop-out rates
* Drop-out rates are, on the other hand, slightly higher for orphans, but the magnitude of the difference registered by the household survey is not large—up to three percentage points out of a combined 3-5 percent dropout rate.
* A possible explanation is that, when facing a challenge, non-orphans are more likely to repeat a grade, while orphans are more likely to exit the system.


## Case study-Lesotho:

#### Primary education:

In 2009, Lesotho’s orphans were attending primary school at a slightly higher rate than non-orphans: 92 and 94 percent, respectively.

* It may seem counterintuitive that orphans are more likely to attend primary school, regardless of their gender, wealth status, or geographic area of residence, but in Lesotho, the latest household data shows a slight advantage for orphans in nearly every case.
* We do not observe any disadvantage experienced by orphans in primary education, at these levels of subnational aggregation.
* This also confirms an important finding: in the African context, orphan status does not necessarily equal vulnerability.
* There are no notable differences between orphans and non-orphans in primary school.


#### Secondary schools:


## Data source- DHS

* Although orphans of each age group are marginally more likely than non-orphans to attend primary school in Lesotho, according to DHS data, the trend is reversed at the secondary level, where non-orphans attend in higher proportions than orphans.
* As the data from primary school systems demonstrate, orphans are more likely than non-orphans to drop out of primary school and never reach secondary, than to repeat a grade.
* Not only are orphans less likely to attend secondary school in Lesotho, but their probability of dropping out while in secondary school is greater with older students: the difference is more than 10 percentage points at age 16, which is closer to the end of the secondary cycle in Lesotho.

## Data source- Student Survey

* This distribution roughly corresponds to the actual prevalence of orphanhood in Lesotho as noted by nationwide household surveys in large part resulting from the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
* The fact that orphans are able to attend secondary school in such large numbers may be a tribute to the support structures currently in place, including a government-funded secondary level scholarship program targeting OVC.

## Family:
* a large proportion of the surveyed students in Lesotho have experienced some form of family disruption: either one or both of their parents had died, or they were unaware of whether or not their parents were alive.
* orphans might miss school more often than non-orphans because of family hardship, discrimination, and/or unfriendly learning environments.

## Grades:

* Orphans and students with unclear parental status (grouped together for the purposes of this analysis) are less likely to attain Standard 1 grades (the highest performance level) on the primary leaving exam and are distinctively more likely to attain Standard 3 (the lowest passing level).

## Attendance:
* A group-level analysis of orphans and students with unclear family status compared with their non-orphaned peers showed that, generally, there are no stark differences in the level of reported non-attendance. 
* Orphans reported that they were more likely to miss school for economic reasons, such as having no money to pay for school fees or having insufficient food at home. 
* less than 40 percent of orphans are likely to have missed school due to lack of food since starting secondary school, compared to only 23 percent of non-orphans—making the probability of missing school for that reason 50 percent greater for orphans.
* When the clustered nature of the sample is adjusted through fixed effects regression modeling, where only within-school variation is taken into account, the difference in probability of missing school due to lack of food declines to 30 percent higher among orphans. In other words, orphans enrolled in secondary school are more likely to report missing school than their non-orphaned peers because of a lack of food.
* Orphans, on average, were more likely to perceive that teachers were mistreating them, and cite that as a reason for missing school. The probability of teacher mistreatment causing nonattendance was 15 percentage points higher for orphans in the sample. The error variance surrounding this estimate was, however, too great to be able to generalize this relationship to the population at large. 


##### Data source- Ethnographic Study

Smiley (2011) conducted an ethnographic study over a nine-month period, from August 2009 through April 2010, in a rural village in Lesotho.
Aspects of ethnographic study:
- typical secondary school in rural Lesotho was selected to serve as a case study
- in-depth interviews were conducted with approximately twenty teachers and administrators
- A group of students in the ninth year of schooling was at the heart of the study, representing double orphans, single orphans, non-orphans facing other significant life challenges such as ill or abusive parents, and children with no outward signs of such challenges.
- The researcher collected 113 diary entries on ten topics from eighteen students, also visiting most of the children at home and interviewing each of them in depth.


###### Findings of the ethnographic study:
* It found that locally, child vulnerability, referred to by all participants as “neediness,” was related not to parental death, but to the absence of a strong caregiver in the child’s home, whether a parent, other relative or non-relative.
* A strong caregiver was defined as one that provides children with material support as well as behavioral guidance, leading the child to 1) appear physically well cared for and 2) follow local norms of appropriate child behavior.
* According to research participants, children lacking strong adult caregivers tended to resist these childhood norms, displaying an attitude of stubbornness that was locally defined as an unwillingness to submit to adult control and act properly. 
* Stubborn children also had a tendency to engage in behaviors considered the domain of adults: both positive (such as income generation and caring for family members) and negative (such as pre-marital sex and alcohol abuse).
* Thus, in Lesotho, orphanhood and vulnerability (neediness) are not one and the same. Importantly, stubborn children were assumed to be needy because of their “bad” behavior, and children without strong adult caregivers were expected to be stubborn.
* Vulnerable children tended to act in conscious opposition to school rules and adult authority, and as a result, were more often targeted by teachers for corporal punishment.
* Observation and interview data revealed that these students were likely to consider dropping out of school rather than face daily confrontations with teachers.
* Thus, it was clear that needy children have a qualitatively different educational experience than those with strong adult caregivers at home, with particular challenges related to the school environment.


## Studies after secondary schooling -findings:
* All students, without a substantive difference by orphan status, are expected to continue their education at the university level (97 percent).
* Perhaps this was due to the fact that if students (orphan or non-orphan) reached secondary school, they were already motivated to attain the highest possible level of education.
* approximately 91 percent of all students, including 90 percent of orphans, are expected to land a well-paying job as a result of their schooling.
* However, over half of all survey respondents indicated plans for leaving Lesotho upon completion of their studies (53 percent of the sample), and orphans were slightly more likely to want to do so (59 percent).
* Lesotho’s close connection with its economically powerful neighbor, South Africa, makes leaving the country a real possibility. 
* Once again, it was found that the data do not support a substantive disadvantage facing orphans in secondary school, though orphans do appear to be more likely to face challenges related to poverty—indicated by proxies such as lack of food and money for school fees. 


## Conclusory remarks:
* Through a set of DHS household surveys, a student survey, and ethnographic data from Lesotho a clear pattern has emerged: orphanhood, per se, is not a very strong predictor of vulnerability, at least in relation to educational participation.
* Poverty in general, and lack of adult care in particular, appear to be more strongly associated with educational challenges than orphanhood, and it is the overlap between these categories that often leads them to be used interchangeably.
* One of the major lessons that can be drawn from this study is that, to some extent, all children who live in poverty, particularly those in AIDS-affected environments, can be considered vulnerable, though different groups of children will face a range of challenges in different contexts.
