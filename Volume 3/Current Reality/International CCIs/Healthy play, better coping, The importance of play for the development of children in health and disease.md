## Scope: 
A study on how PLAY is important for child health development. The majority of the research is done on the animal kingdom and less on humankind. There is limited research on Play intervention in the development of children with chronic illness but certain comparison with animal behaviours to that of humans have tried giving the researchers a way forward.

# Introduction 
- Play is apparent throughout cultures, and it occurs in most non-human mammalian species, as well as in certain birds and reptiles
    * ‘Homo Ludens: A study of the play-element in culture’ (1938), historian Johan Huizinga already identified play as one of the most central activities in flourishing societies
    * Evolution perspective play must serve an important purpose considering the costs it entails in terms of time, energy and risk of injury and predation 
    * From a developmental perspective, play allows children to experiment with their behavioural and social repertoire, and to practice their physical and communication skills
    * Play facilitates the development of social competence, emotional capacities and resilience, creativity and problem-solving skills
    * Play Behaviour in different children:
        * Differences in play behaviour amongst these patients have been described as early as during the first year of life continuing through all phases of play development these may have a further long-lasting negative impact on the development of these children

## Childhood Chronic Diseases:
- chronic somatic disorder (i.e. cystic fibrosis, auto-immune diseases or a congenital heart defect) 
            * who have a (current or previous) condition (e.g. premature birth or childhood cancer) with possible life-long consequences 
            * group of these children are likely to display reduced or different forms of play behaviour 
            * significantly increased risk for physical, social, emotional and cognitive problems later in life
        * Functional impairments in physical, social, emotional and cognitive domains are due to:
            * the disease itself (e.g. fatigue, pain)
            * stressful events (e.g. hospitalization, surgery, medical procedures) 
            * environmental changes resulting from the condition (e.g. over-anxious parents, social-attachment issues, social interactions with peers)
        * Play behaviour is also impaired in child and adolescent mental disorders, such as depression, anxiety, autism, disruptive behaviour disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and schizophrenia
        * the fact that changes in social interaction and play are often also intrinsically part of the symptom complex of primary psychiatric disorders and not only the result of them, makes it hard to disentangle the contribution of the disease itself and its consequences in this group of children
 
 ## The Importance of Play for Healthy Development
- What is Play?
	     Huizinga (1938) described play as ‘a volitional act, within certain limits of space and time, according to voluntarily accepted, but compelling rules, being a goal in itself, accompanied by feelings of excitement and joy, different from everyday life
        * diversity of play elements in culture and convincingly shows that such elements can be found in games, sports, role-play, theatre, dance, stories, language, poetry, rituals, politics, music, competition, war, knowledge, law, philosophy and art
        * ‘Philosophical Investigations’, the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein (1953) argues that the forms and meanings of play are not separated from each other by sharp boundaries and seem to blend into one another 
        * Burghardt and colleagues characterized play from a biological perspective, using five criteria which have striking parallels with Huizinga’s description: play is (1) not fully functional in the context in which it appears, (2) spontaneous, pleasurable, rewarding, and voluntary, (3) different from other more serious behaviours in form (e.g. exaggerated) or timing (e.g. occurring early in life before the more serious version is needed), (4) repeated, but not in unvarying stereotypic form (e.g. rocking or pacing) and (5) initiated in the absence of severe stress (e.g. Graham and Burghardt, 2010)

## Forms and Functions of Play in Human Beings
- Lester and Russel (2008) for example describe five dimensions of play: (1) highly active games such as chasing, rough-and-tumble play and play fighting, (2) pretend and sociodramatic play, (3) language play, (4) social play and games with rules and (5) and construction play. The National Institute for Play discerns seven forms of play: (1) attunement or mimic play, (2) body play & movement, (3) object play, (4) social play, (5) imaginative and pretend play, (6) storytelling-narrative play and (7) creative play
        * Erikson (1977) proposed that play allows children to experiment with a wide range of experiences, and simulates their potential real-life consequences
        * Piaget (1962) theorized that make-believe play provides children with opportunities to reproduce real-life conflicts, to work out ideal resolutions for their own pleasure, and to ameliorate negative feelings
        * Narratives and story-telling can support children in integrating a broad variety of positive and negative life experiences
        * In adolescence, co-constructed narratives have been linked to the development of identity, which is considered a key-element for mental health 
        * Play may also allow for the expression of frustration and rage, allowing the child (or adult) to cope with environmental challenges, thereby contributing to mental health 
        * play allows children to experiment and explore, and playful activities provide a secure setting for testing the consequences of many alternative scenarios, in order to develop a rich and flexible behavioural, social and emotional repertoire
        * play throughout life may serve the development, as well as maintenance (perhaps we should call it ‘continued development’ instead) of physical, social, cognitive and emotional functions


    * How Animal Play is different from Human Play
        * On the contrary, animal play can be roughly divided into three categories: locomotor play, object play and social play
        * Most of the mechanistic and developmental studies on play have focused on social play behaviour, especially in rats, and these have demonstrated that social play is a highly rewarding activity
        * Play is thought to be valuable for rehearsing and practicing behaviour required in the adult world, since social play behaviour has similarities in form and structure with adult behaviour in non-play contexts, such as sexual or aggressive behaviours
        * Because of the structural differences between play and adult behaviour, it is well accepted that the function of play goes beyond the mere training of behavioural skills
        * play with others is accompanied or preceded by explicit physical, facial or vocal signals to indicate that the intention of the behaviour is playful in nature, further supporting the notion that play is a separate category of behaviour, rather than primordial sex or aggression 
        * suggests that play behaviour serves to develop physical, social, emotional and cognitive capacities, by varying, repeating, and/or recombining subsequences of behaviour, outside of their primary context 

# Play Development in Childhood Disease
Childhood disease and development of mental health problems
        * The common definition of chronic disease is comprehensive, i.e. not only encompassing the most prevalent conditions, but all possible ones, somatic as well as psychiatric 
        * life expectancy of children with chronic or life-threatening diseases has steadily increased (Perrin et al., 2007; Wise, 2007).
        * this prolonged survival comes at a price, i.e. the burden of living every day with a chronic or life-threatening condition (Murray et al., 2013; Perrin et al., 2007; Wise, 2007)
        * Many of these children, adolescents and young adults, remain dependent on medication and healthcare throughout their lives, and may be severely limited in their daily life activities as a consequence of growing up with chronic health problems and long-term co-morbidities 
        * Young adults who grew up with a childhood chronic disease have achieved significantly fewer milestones, or at older age than their peers, across different domains (e.g. autonomy, psychosexual and social), as measured using the course of life questionnaire
        * Multiple studies have shown that children with chronic somatic conditions are at a substantially greater risk for poor mental health and social problems compared to their healthy peers
        * These health issues include depressive symptoms, anxiety, aggression, physical impairment, and problems in academic and social functioning
        * Greenham et al. (2015) reported that the susceptibility for mental health and social problems was considerably increased in children with stroke and asthma
        * Similarly, survivors of childhood cancer have, among others, a higher propensity to develop neurocognitive problems and learning disabilities (Peckham, 1991), as well as difficulties in social functioning
        * Chronically diseased children can in turn be affected by parents that experience grief, anger, hopelessness, physical problems, social isolation and financial problems (Cousino and Hazen, 2013; Jackson et al., 2015; Kazak et al., 2015; Poder et al., 2008), which may hamper (possibilities to) play and development, thereby affecting the outcome of the child’s illness 
        * Therefore, the long term effects of chronic or life-threatening conditions on the development of patients and their families should always be taken into account


# Challenges of play behaviour in childhood chronic diseases
- In addition to the somatic and psychological consequences of their illness, several factors such as isolation, stigma, inequality, bullying and doubts concerning their physical and intellectual capacities are everyday realities for children with chronic diseases that may negatively impact healthy play and development
        * Being hospitalized, pain and fatigue, social isolation and the ‘other-than-normal’ treatment of diseased children are likely to compromise their play behaviour
        * Health care professionals primarily focus on the biological facets of treatment success, and may be less inclined to address the effects of disease on patients’ daily routine and self-perceptions
        * Conversely, optimal strategies, incorporating diverse methodologies such as very early interventions, play therapies, gaming and interactive technology, aimed at improving well-being and quality of life in this population are much needed
    * The challenging environment and play behaviour in children with chronic diseases
        * there is a relationship between stress, play and resilience in children. Play behaviour can help children with a chronic disease to cope with stress 
        * Animals that are exposed to severe stress, hunger or disease, presumably compromising their wellbeing, play less
        * The sources of stress to which individuals with a past or present childhood (chronic) disease are exposed to are diverse, ranging from stress during hospitalization and treatment regimes to social challenges and physical limitations
        * Interruption of daily routines, an unfamiliar environment, strange and frightening equipment, and feelings of a lack of control may increase stress in children during hospitalization (Shields, 2001) and can result in a traumatic experience 
        * serious chronic illness can have detrimental effects on school attendance, relations with peers at school and school engagement
        * Students with chronic illness demonstrate mixed school experiences and outcomes that are often worse than students without a chronic disease
        * Clearly, there are no human studies that assessed the impact of play deprivation. However, it has been shown that hospitalization and treatment trajectories may cause both physical and social isolation thereby hampering social play and participation, which have been found to be risk factors for cognitive problems 
        * although children or adolescents with chronic or life-threatening diseases are at risk for adverse outcomes and developmental problems (Pinquart and Shen, 2011), some children appear to thrive in spite of difficult circumstances (Rolland and Walsh, 2006)
        * This apparent inter-individual variation in the long-term outcome of childhood chronic diseases may reflect variability in individuals’ adaptive capacity, determined by neurobiological and psychological factors, as well as environmental factors, independent of the disease 

#  Play as an intervention to improve developmental outcomes 
From a therapeutic perspective, play as intervention is valuable because play: (1) regulates negative affect and diminishes stress, (2) facilitates coping with adverse events, (3) is useful for processing new information both cognitively and emotionally by allowing for order and integration, (4) is a safe way to practice new behaviour and experiment with solutions, (5) stimulates fantasy and creative (divergent) thinking and (6) stimulates the development of empathy 

## Play in paediatric (hospital) care
- In paediatrics, play is commonly used to support existing treatment programs and paediatric (hospital) care, although only a few studies have specifically focused on the impact of play on treatment outcomes
        * Applied as a mediator, play may enhance social contact and reduce anxiety and depression, thus reducing the psychopathology and subsequent fatigue often reported by children with a chronic disease
        * a study in Brazil showed that playful communication with children about their chronic illness resulted in better coping with the disease
        * Child life specialists support children during their treatment in an age appropriate manner, to reduce medical related traumatic stress by, for example, preparing them for medical procedures and teaching them adequate coping strategies
        * hospitalization period should, if possible, not interrupt play routines in a child’s life, since play activities may help the child to identify a similarity with his/her life outside the hospital, making it easier to adapt to a hospital stay
        * Safeguarding and managing the mental health of infants lays the basis for healthy development, thereby laying the foundation for greater social, emotional and intellectual capacities
        * For older children, our recent studies show that skills training, e.g. sports or social interactions, in a playful setting improves the ability of patients to cope with their disease (van Brussel et al., 2011)
        * Based on such findings, group-based prevention programs – focusing on the integration of bodily self-awareness, emotional self-experience and social interaction through play and sports – have now been structurally implemented in the care of children aged 8-12 years with chronic conditions 
        * Other examples are games that have been applied to enhance coping and provide psycho-education such as the haemophilia coping and perception test (HCPT) and Shoptalk

## Treatment potential of game technology
- Indeed, recent studies have used applied games to successfully decrease anxiety or depressive symptoms in adolescents
        * Playing games can influence social, emotional and cognitive development. The immersive social context of today’s games help gamers rapidly learn social skills and pro-social behaviour
        *  playing a prosocial game was shown to induce long-lasting enhancements in e.g. helping, cooperation, empathy and emotional awareness 
        * individuals who had played a cooperative game showed more prosocial behaviour in a dilemma task than players who had played competitively, suggesting that these behaviours might be transferable to their peer and family relations outside the gaming environment
        * Little is known about the long-term effects of gaming on emotions and mood, although there are reasons to think that gaming may be positive for an individual’s growth and social connection
        * Furthermore, playing video games can enhance problem solving skills and creativity and, mostly action games, have a positive impact on focus and spatial skills
        * In addition, a recent study on the consequences of playing video games, identified positive outcome for intellectual functioning, competence in reading, mathematics, spelling and academic achievement
        * On the one hand, games can be used to distract patients and help them to cope with the side effects of treatments, like nausea, vomiting, anxiety, fatigue and pain, much the same as physical play does
        * On the other hand, regular games can be used to motivate and engage patients in physical activity and therapy as well
        * computer games may have the same effect as an often more expensive relaxation training
        * Games also have the potential to enhance mental health and wellbeing in children and adolescents
        * no studies to date have investigated the effect of applied games on depressive or anxiety symptoms of children with a chronic disease, although there is increasing attention in the pediatric setting for (applied) games and the use of apps
        * Modern technology has also led to a new type of gameplay in which the users are forced to be physically active as part of the game play
        * Applied games could be combined with patient-tailored tools to assess a patient’s wellbeing in dedicated e-health platforms to deliver personalized interventions
        * A broad implementation of e-health applications, aimed at prevention and intervention strategies, has the potential to be a cost-effective instrument to increase social participation and optimal development of chronically diseased children

#  Conclusion and Further Directions
- Play interventions, either real-life, digital, or combined, have clear potential to enhance physical, social, emotional and cognitive development
    * As such, they hold great promise for both preventive and treatment strategies directed at psychosocial problems of children with chronic or life-threatening diseases
    * This warrants interdisciplinary research on play behaviour – as it relates to the optimal healthy development of children and adolescents with a chronic somatic condition – focusing on the following three aspect
        * First, in order to enable a systematic monitoring and analysis of play behaviour in relation to physical, social, emotional and cognitive development, innovative longitudinal measurements and life span designs are needed
        * Secondly, more systematic large-scale studies are needed to assess and develop effective play-based preventive and treatment options for young patients with chronic conditions, through real-life training-programs, virtual reality approaches or gaming interventions
        * Moreover, an important daily reality for children and adolescents with chronic diseases is that their symptoms (e.g. pain and fatigue) and the long-lasting intensive treatments often limit their participation in peer, family, school, and physical activities, which can result in unwanted social exclusion
        * Innovative play-based strategies addressing the possible societal consequences of chronic childhood diseases should therefore also promote social inclusion by encouraging the enduring interaction with healthy peers
        * Third, more knowledge about play behaviour and the development of children with a chronic disease can be used to develop and improve educative means to raise awareness about chronic childhood disease, for example to increase awareness about depression
        * Understanding the impact of aberrant play behaviour in chronic childhood disease will also provide more insight in the role of play behaviour in human development in general
        * by systematically studying neurobiological and psychological determinants of stress resilience that enable these patients to adapt to the physical, social, emotional and cognitive challenges of life, much might be learned about adolescents’ adaptive capacities, from which all adolescents may benefit in their healthy development
        * The advantages of investigating play in relation to healthy development are clear: it promotes the well-being and quality of life and serves a strong basis for future health of young patients with chronic conditions and their families, and converges with the prospect of a more meaningful and inclusive society, and a more efficient and cost-effective healthcare system
