# Brief:



* Scope & Description: A study was conducted to explore the differences in educational outcomes between children-in-care and children-out-of-care and it was found that being in care is not a directly related with poor educational outcomes. Other influential factors were found that are discussed.

# Difference between educational outcomes of children in care with those out-of-care



    * Both the children currently in care and those in the home group were less likely to meet age-related expectations for receptive vocabulary, literacy and communication than children in the general population. Children in the care appeared slightly more likely to meet the standard age-related expectations for receptive vocabulary than the home group, although this difference did not quite reach significance. 
    * In teacher assessments of communication (listening, speaking and understanding), however, the care group were significantly less likely to meet expectations than the home group. Nevertheles, the difference between children in care and other children with histories of child welfare involvement was not statistically significant, reflecting findings elsewhere


# Other factors influencing educational outcomes of children in care with those out-of-care



    * Other factors influencing poor educational outcomes were having behaviour problems at school (receptive vocabulary and literacy) and receiving support for SEN (literacy and communication).
    * Childrenâ€™s pre-care experiences, including abuse, neglect and other adversities, the emotional and behavioural problems they may develop as a consequence of these experiences and the higher likelihood that they would have a disability or SEN are all likely to play a part in driving educational outcomes for these children.
    * Children in the care group were significantly more likely to have experienced severe maltreatment. They had also experienced a significantly higher total number of risk factors, including more types of abuse and neglect and more parental problems. The care group were also more likely to be disabled and to have SEN, although these differences did not quite reach statistical significance. Their parents were nearly twice as likely to have problems of drug or alcohol misuse, and were more likely to be involved in offending and to have a disability or chronic health problem.
