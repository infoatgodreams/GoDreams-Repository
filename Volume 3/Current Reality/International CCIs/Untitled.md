# Brief:
* Scope & Description: The study focuses on the temporal dynamics during the early adulthood transition among children in out-of-home care. It explores early adulthood education and employment trajectories among young adults who experienced out-of-home care during childhood. For the data, a sample of N=59,476 of whom 1893 were in care was taken up. The study took place in Finland on all children born in 1987.

## Method:
A trajectory clustering from a previous study on the 1987 birth cohort was used to compare trajectories between children in care and a propensity score-matched group of peers never in care. A longitudinal birth cohort data comprising individual-level information from national registers of all children born in Finland in 1987 (N = 59 476, of whom 1893 were in care) was used for the purpose of this study. The follow-up data used in this study spans the period from the fetal stage until the end of 2012 (i.e., until age 25)


## Hypothesis:

We expect that adverse childhood experiences and socio-economic background related to placement in care are associated with trajectories that individuals enter as young adults.
- For this, 12 early adulthood trajectory types were identified
* We examine the trajectories by investigating how young adults with care experience divide into these twelve trajectories and by comparing the results with those of a matched group of peers never in care.


## Out-of-home care in Finland
* out-of-home care is considered a “last resort” measure
* the number of children in care doubled from the 1990s to the 2010s, and the cumulative probability that children would be placed in care at some point totaled 5.8% for children born in 1999
* Infants (age 0) and adolescents (ages 13–16) are at the highest risk of the first placement
* risk factors for placements include:
    * parent’s low socioeconomic status
    * single parenthood
    * mental health
    * substance abuse problems
* Placements may last from days to many years, depending on the situation of the child and family.


### Finnish Education system:

* Transitions to adulthood in the Finnish system are structured by the nation’s education system
* school-leavers at the end of compulsory basic education (typically aged 16 years) opt for general or vocational secondary education
* Finland’s well-developed education system generally promotes labor market access, educational attainment in the form of formal qualifications is important for employability


## Parental confounder

To compare children in care with peers never in care, data were drawn from registers on several individual and parental confounders to find matches with similar pre-care characteristics for the care-experienced population. 
* The selected confounders include parents’ education (highest parental education on a three-level scale: basic, secondary, and post-secondary)
* social assistance benefit receipt (either of the parents received income support, a means-tested last-resort benefit, for six months during at least one of the follow-up years)
* mental health problems (either of the parents diagnosed with mental health problems in inpatient care).
* parents’ alcohol and drug abuse problems (either of the parents received alcohol and drug-related diagnosis in inpatient care)
* young maternal age at a child’s birth (less than 20 years)
* and parental death (either of the parents died)
* child’s nicotine exposure during pregnancy.


## Care history characters:
- Regardless of the causal effects of the care history factors on children in care, several of them are potential predictors of future outcomes. The selected care history factors:
	* age at first placement (first placement before age 13 or at age 13–17)
	* time spent in care
	* number of placements
	* most typical placement type (foster family care, residential care, or other types of care)
	* aging out of care (spent time in care at the age of 17)
	* and receipt of after-care housing support (Child welfare’s after-care housing support in Finland is one form of after-care services provided until age 21 on a voluntary basis for those leaving or aging out of care)


## Matched peer groups:

* Exact matching on sex was done and then used a maximum caliper of 0.3 to select controls using propensity scores (caliper is the maximum allowable difference in the propensity to be placed in care between a case and control).
* For both sexes, matching was done in three steps. First, matches were selected for those placed at ages 0 to 6. Then excluded the selected matches from the general population never in care and did the matching procedure for those placed at ages 7 to 12. Lastly, the matching for those placed at ages 13 to 17 was done. 


## Key findings:

* Young adults who were placed in out-of-home (children in care) care as children and young people have high risks for low levels of –
    * Education
    * Unemployment
    * reliance on social assistance benefit schemes
    * disability
    * As well as for unfavorable outcomes related to health, housing, and criminal behavior
* A notable proportion of this population also become parents at an early age
* Approximately one-half of these young people are likely to face troubling outcomes of varying degrees, characterized by the problems noted above 
* While the other half is relatively resilient across life domains and participates actively in education and work
* Among children in care, vocational secondary education aimed at working life is a significantly more common choice than secondary education that prepares them for higher education. However, by age 23, more than half of former children in care have failed to complete either of the secondary-level tracks
* Children in care also receive social assistance benefits more often and have a higher likelihood of obtaining a decision for disability pension than their peers without experience in care.


## Education and employment trajectories:

Young adults with care experience were less likely to enter trajectories characterized by education and employment than peers never in care

* Overall, trajectories where participation in education and work are typical and relatively stable, which included 38% of the care population, 62% of the matched peer group, and 74% of the total general population never in care.
* In comparison with the matched peer group, those with care experience were less likely to enter one of the trajectories where participation in higher education is common.
* However, the difference between children in care and matched peers not in care was statistically insignificant when observing trajectories where students received secondary level study benefit (a benefit based on parents’ income level) during vocational or general secondary education before entering higher education or stable employment.
* Where young adults gained employment after initial unemployment is concerned, there was no statistically significant difference between children in care and either of the two peer groups, the matched peer group, and the total general population never in care.
    * In the trajectory type - where **unemployment alternates with employment** and the trajectory where **unemployment alternates with periods of social assistance benefit receipt**. Of the matched peer group and the total general population never in care, 8% and 3%, respectively, entered one of these trajectories, whereas the corresponding figure for young adults with care experience was 21%. In each of the three groups, the majority of young adults in these trajectories were men.
    * In trajectory type - with **fragmented education, employment, and “no-data” periods**, there were no statistically significant differences between children in care and those never in care; 8% of those in care were in this trajectory. Entering the “no-data” trajectory was more common among children in care, but after matching, the difference remained statistically significant only in men. Of men and women with care experience, 10% and 6% had very few traces in the registers used in this study, suggesting that they were not employed, registered as unemployed, or receiving any of the studied benefits or pensions. 


## Early parenthood trajectory

Young adults with care experience were more likely than peers never in care to have children in early adulthood. This is indicated by the higher share of children in care in the early parenthood trajectory.

* Individuals in this trajectory were almost exclusively women. Of women with care experience, 26% entered the early parenthood trajectory, while corresponding figures for women without care experience were 16% in the matched group and 8% in the total general population.
* Differences between the groups in the late parenthood trajectory were not statistically significant.


## Summary of study results:
* The findings showed that placement in care is strongly associated with temporal dynamics during the period from age 18 to 25.
* The results demonstrated that in comparison with peers with a similar birth-family background but no care experience, children in care have high risks of trajectories where unemployment, reliance on social assistance benefits, and early parenthood are common.
* The study found that children in care were less likely to participate in higher education than peers never in care from families with similar backgrounds. Those that entered higher education did so mostly through a trajectory where their education was supported by secondary level study benefits.
* The results also point to significant gender differences in transitions. Boys in care had particularly elevated risks to enter NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) types of trajectories, whereas girls in care had an increased likelihood of early parenthood.
* Results suggested that higher age at entry into care, placement instability (higher number of placements), and residential care are associated with entering trajectories that involve early parenthood, social assistance benefit reliance, and unemployment.
