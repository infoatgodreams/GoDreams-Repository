## Impact of Institutionalisation
- Orphanages usually do not meet the conditions of the average expectable environment, a prerequisite for children’s normal development, encompassing protective, stable caregiving and open opportunities for exploration and mastery of the world. 
- In this respect, institutional care implies structural neglect. Numerous studies have shown that children growing up in orphanages are at risk in various domains of functioning, including their physical, socio-emotional and cognitive development
- With regard to physical development, institutional care has shown dramatic negative effects on growth, with a meta-analytic effect size of d51.71 for the association between height and duration of stay in the orphanage
- Often it is not (only) deficiencies in nutrition or medical care that cause growth retardation, but that these growth delays are also the result of socio-emotional neglect.
- Children living in orphanages are often markedly delayed, to the point of apparent mental retardation that disappears with improving environments. 
- The combined effect size of 75 studies of cognitive delays in orphanages is d50.74, with an absolute difference in IQ between institutionalized and family-reared children of 20 IQ points. 
- Adoption can thus be depicted as an effective intervention for institutionalized children, and it makes sense to propose adoption or foster care as preferred alternatives to institutional care.
- In the same vein, in a randomized control trial the Bucharest Early Intervention Project showed that foster care as an intervention improved the cognitive outcome of children substantially (Nelson et al., 2007). Foster care intervention led to improved cognitive outcomes for the intervention children, with effect sizes of d50.62 at 42 months and d50.47 at 54 months.
- In some countries adoption and foster care are culturally unacceptable or economically impossible (Wolff & Fesseha, 1998); moreover, some children are shunned by potential adoptive or foster parents due to their special needs or clinical condition and are therefore likely to remain in institutional care. 
- In this commentary we present a narrative review and a meta-analysis of intervention studies in orphanages and children’s homes with reported outcomes on child cognitive development.We estimate the combined effect size of the interventions and test which study characteristics are significant moderators of effectiveness.

## Interventions improving Cognitive Development in Institutionalized Children
- Intervention efforts aimed at ameliorating the negative effects of institutionalization on children’s cognitive development date back to the 1930s, spanning a period of70 years of interventions in orphanages.
- Selection criteria for inclusion were that the intervention took place in the institution (excluding Skeels & Dye, 1939, who moved intervention infants from an orphanage to an institution for mentally retarded females who spent time with the children and formed special relationships with them; thereupon they were adopted and did not return to the orphanage), and that cognitive development as the outcome measure was assessed through observation (excluding Smyke, Dumitrescu, & Zeanah, 2002, where caregivers were interviewed on children’s language development.
- Typically developing children and children with disabilities were included in the meta-analysis as two separate studies. Typically developing intervention children outperformed control children with a difference of more than one standard deviation on the Battelle developmental scales 
- Children with disabilities gained about half as much from the intervention compared to typically developing children (see Table 29), presumably because children with specific disabilities were more limited in their ability to improve developmentally

## Meta Analysis of all studies
- The Meta-analysis of the studies reviewed above was performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis program (CMA, Borenstein, Rothstein, & Cohen, 2005, Version 2)
- Interventions in orphanages have been quite successful in enhancing children’s cognitive development
- Several moderators were tested to explore differences between effect sizes. Focus and duration of the intervention did not make a difference for the effectiveness of the intervention. No significant difference in effect size was found between randomized control trials and studies with other designs.
- The timing of the intervention however made a significant difference. Interventions starting before the first birthday of the child were significantly more effective (d51.03, k58, N5468) than interventions starting at a later age. 
- Effect sizes decreased with increasing age of the children at the start of the intervention. 
- More recent studies reported more effective interventions (d50.98, k57, N5578) than earlier studies (d50.55, k57, N5248), and interventions in North America (Canada and United States) were less effective (d50.55, k56, N5235) than interventions implemented in other parts of the world. 
* Conclusion
    * Interventions in orphanages have been successful in enhancing children’s cognitive development. The combined effect size in the current meta-analysis of orphanage-based interventions (d50.84) is much larger than the effect ofearly educational programs to stimulate socio-economically disadvantaged family-reared children’s cognitive development.
    * This may point to the extremely disadvantageous rearing environment of institutional settings when care as usual is provided, to children’s plasticity to overcome their delays resulting from institutions’ standard care, and to the variety of means that can be used to achieve the aim of stimulating cognitive development in institutionalized children.
    * that this finding pertains to cognitive development as an outcome, and may not hold for other domains of functioning.
    * Brief interventions may show fading benefits, apart from the emotional consequences for institutionalized children who are confronted with (the termination of) an intervention that provided them with badly needed attention for only brief periods per day.
    * The dire necessity of stimulation for child cognitive development, and have offered the materials that may be integrated in broader interventions to improve institutional care. 
    * The remarkable catch-up shown by adopted children in comparison with their peers who remain behind in institutional care (e.g., Rutter et al., 1998; Van IJzendoorn & Juffer, 2006) cannot for the greater part be ascribed to selection b
    * Interventions with children younger than 12 months were more effective than interventions starting at a later age. Similar effects have been found for children’s physical growth (Van IJzendoorn et al., 2007), school achievement (Van IJzendoorn et al., 2005), and attachment security.
    * The foster care intervention of the Bucharest Early Intervention Project seemed most effective for children who were placed before 24 months. Since only two orphanage intervention studies started with children older than 24 months (Gavrin & Sacks, 1963; Skeels, 1937), the contrast between interventions starting before and after the second birthday could not be meta analytically tested.
    *  
    * The superior effectiveness of intervention studies in other parts of the world may reflect the lower level of standard care in institutions in these countries, leaving maximum room for improvement. In support of this explanation, the meta-analytic effect size for the difference in IQ between family-reared and institutionalized children in countries with low socioeconomic levels of development is two times larger than the difference between family-reared and institutionalized children in more developed countries (Van IJzendoorn et al., 2008), indicating that in orphanages in less developed countries more is to be gained from intervention.
    * Challenges
    * HIV infection, still spreading in many parts of the world, has become a growing reason for child institutionalization due to parental death or child abandonment (UNICEF, 2007). In the near future, the HIV/AIDS pandemic may exponentially increase the number of orphans in the African continent.
    * In addition, HIV infection itself has become a growing reason for child institutionalization (UNICEF, 2007). Up to 20% of children born to HIV-infected women are abandoned and end up in institutional care (UNICEF).
    * In general, orphaned and abandoned children with HIV are shunned by potential adoptive or foster parents and are therefore likely to remain in institutional care.
