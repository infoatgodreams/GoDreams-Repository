# Brief

- Scope & Description: This paper mainly contradicts the hypothesis that group home placement universally adversely affects child wellbeing. Without substantial improvements in and support for family settings, the removal of institutions, would not significantly improve child wellbeing and could worsen outcomes of children who are moved from a setting where they are doing relatively well to a more deprived setting. The study uses two-stage random sampling methodology identified community representative samples of 1,357 institution dwelling orphaned and separated children (OSC) and 1,480 family-dwelling OSC aged 6–12 from 5 low and middle income countries.

# Summary

Findings from studies on Institutional Caregiving of orphaned children
- The extent to which care in institutions negatively affects children's development and wellbeing has become a central question for international aid policy affecting LMICs with large numbers and rates of children living in adversity
- Policy documents and legislation related to the care of children in institutions frequently cite studies of children who as infants lived in socially and emotionally deprived institutions in Romania and Russia.
  - These studies demonstrated powerful negative effects on the infant brain and child development .
  - When infants were removed from this environment to live with trained, paid, and supervised foster parents in Romania, brain and child development improvements were observed.
- In a meta-analysis of studies examining children in institutional and family care it was found that while intelligence quotient values trended toward being lower among infants in institutions, this relationship was not observed in lower income countries like Ethiopia , Kenya, and Eritrea, and was not observed among children over age five
- Recent assessments of children's nutritional status in Kenya  and of psychosocial status in China found children in group homes were doing somewhat better than their family-based comparisons
- The Positive Outcomes for Orphans (POFO) study is the only that enrolled a statistically representative sample of both institution-based and family-based orphaned and separated children (OSC) from culturally diverse sites across multiple LMICs
  - Cross-sectional analyses of baseline data found that health, emotional functioning, learning ability, memory, and physical growth were comparable, on average, for the 1,357 children living in 83 institutional care settings and the 1,480 children living with families in 311 community clusters (geographically bounded sampling areas) in the same regions.

## Study Description

- POFO is an ongoing longitudinal study following a cohort of children, starting at ages 6 to 12, living in institutional or family based settings in six sites in five low and middle income countries: Battambang District, Cambodia; Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Bungoma District, Kenya; Nagaland and Hyderabad, India; and Kilimanjaro Region, Tanzania
- Children were enrolled between 2006 and 2008 and followed biannually, with varying amounts of information collected on children in different rounds
- At follow-up the children were ages 8 to 16.
- The principal measures of child wellbeing, which were collected at baseline and the 3-year follow-up assessment, are: physical growth, general health, emotional difficulties, learning ability, and memory.
- One child per household was selected to participate in the study.

## Methodology

- A two-stage random sampling methodology identified community representative samples of 1,357 institution dwelling orphaned and separated children (OSC) and 1,480 family-dwelling OSC aged 6–12 from 5 low and middle income countries.
- Data were collected from children and their primary caregivers.
- The children&#39;s (self-identified) primary caregivers were asked to respond to surveys about themselves and the children

## Wellbeing Measures

- Physical Health and Growth- Caregiver-reported child health measures included symptoms of fever, cough, and diarrhea in the last 2 weeks and the general health of the child. The latter was rated on a scale of 1 to 5 from the Medical Outcomes.
- The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was asked of children over age 10 and of the caregivers for all children caregiver report.
- Learning Ability and Memory- Three subtests from the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children-II (KABC-II)  were used to evaluate learning ability: sequential processing and short term memory; spatial relations and visual motor integration; and visual problem solving abilities were assessed using the Movements, Triangles, and Pattern Reasoning subtests

## Findings and Discussion

- There is substantial individual-level variation across eight measures of health and wellbeing over three years among OSC living in institutions and OSC living with families
- At the aggregate, children in both settings improved on most wellbeing measures over time, while the family-based children improved more over time, and could be catching up to the wellbeing status of the institution-based children.
- In nearly all cases the magnitude of both the differences between institution- and family-based children and the differences in changes over time were substantively negligible when compared to the variation between children within settings.
- There are relatively few systematic differences evident when comparing average health and wellbeing between institution-based and family-based OSC as a whole

## Implications

- This study and ours should not be interpreted to mean that institutions are the preferred living environment for children, but rather that a family-based setting is not guaranteed to be a better place for a child to live
- The quality of care provided within a setting, whether that setting be family based
 or institution-based, makes the difference in child wellbeing outcomes.
- Recognizing that contexts are not necessarily interchangeable, continued study and inclusion of other contexts and conditions are needed to better understand the various trajectories of positive and negative outcomes in different settings
- With a large and growing number of children living on the streets in many, there is a critical need not only for additional care setting options but also those to be supported to provide high quality care
