# Brief:

- Scope & Description: This study examines differences in personal hygiene and in the perception of social rejection between children in reception centers and children living in a family setting. The study was carried out in the Murcia Autonomous Community (Spain). In comparison to the Children Living in Families (CLFs), the Children in Reception Centers (CRCs) had poorer hygiene habits in all dimensions studied, were less likely to consider their families as the most influential agent in learning hygiene habits, and were more likely to experience social rejection due to their hygiene and to be motivated by this rejection to carry out personal hygiene activities

## Social Determinants of Health and Hygiene

- Social Determinants of Health (SDH) include contextual factors and structural mechanisms and the particular socioeconomic status of individuals.
- Intermediate determinants of SDHs include material resources, psychosocial, behavioral, and biological factors, and healthcare systems. Health inequities are caused by an unequal distribution of factors determining.
- The family is the first and most important influence on the health and development of children and on the shaping of their routines, habits, attitudes, and social behaviors, including personal hygiene habits
- Improvements in sanitary conditions and the acquisition of certain personal hygiene practices during childhood have played a decisive role in reducing infant mortality and increasing life expectancy
- Inadequate hygiene practices have also been implicated in infant morbidity in developed countries, including infectious and parasitic diseases, pneumonia, otitis, mycosis, diarrhea, dental caries, gingivitis, and pediculosis.
- Poor hygiene can also be a cause of social rejection, especially for children from poorer families
- the risk of family poverty has been increased by economic recession, family breakups, and migration, among other factors
- In extreme cases, such as abuse or abandonment, the state can move children into reception centers for their protection and safety.

## Research Objective and Methodology

- The objective of this study was to determine whether CRCs and children living in families (CLFs) differ in their personal hygiene habits and learning and in their perception of social rejection.
- Methodology - observational, cross-sectional study compares a group of CRCs with a group of CLFs
- The study was carried out in the Murcia Autonomous Community (Spain).
  - On 1 January 2018, the population was 1,475,568 inhabitants. The gross monthly average salary of Murcia Autonomous Community workers is 1.761 euros, life expectancy at birth is 82,37 years old, and the unemployment rate was 14.16%
- Children aged between 7 and 12 years old were studied from March 2015 through January 2017
- CRCs were recruited within the first two days of admission to two centers in the Network of State Care Centers (first stage in the fostering process
- CLFs were recruited from three primary public schools selected by convenience from a rural and urban setting in the same region
- The eligible population was all children in the selected schools and reception centers who met the following inclusion criteria: age between 7 and 12 years, voluntary participation, and written consent to participate from parents or legal guardians.
- Exclusion criteria were inability to speak Spanish or the presence of physical/psychological disabilities that hindered participation
- A questionnaire was administered to parents/guardians of the CLFs to gather data on their educational level, current occupation, type of employment, and household monthly income
- CLFs were divided into three groups according to income: ≤1000 €, 1001–2000 €, and \&gt;2000 €. Information was also collected on the sex, age, and nationality of the children, the nationality of the parents, the number of siblings, and the days of school attendance per week
- The outcome variables considered were: body, hair, hands, and oral hygiene, agents that influence personal hygiene learning, perceived social rejection, and motivations for personal hygiene activities
- Number of items in the questionnaire: body skin (8 items), hair (2 items), hands (5 items), oral (14 items), agents affecting personal hygiene learning (8 items), social rejection (2 items), and motivation for personal hygiene activities (5 items).
- Study eligibility criteria were met by 51 children admitted to the two reception centers, and all completed the questionnaire. Eligibility criteria were met by 758 CLFs in the three schools, and 454 of them completed the questionnaire.

## Findings

### Body washing

- The frequency of body washing &quot;≥3 days a week&quot; was 12-fold to five-fold lower in CRCs than in CLFs.
- A wet towel/sponge was used for body washing by 23.5% of CRCs versus almost 100% of CLFs who reported taking a shower/bath.
- Body washing was performed at night (before bedtime) by 39.2% of CRCs versus lt;50% of CLFs.
- With regard to materials, gels were not used or known by 21.6% of CRCs versus 3.6–7.1% of CLFs.
- The use of bar soap was uncommon but was more frequent by CRCs than by CLFs.
- A washbowl was more often used in body washing by CRCs than by CLFs, whose use of this complement was less frequent with higher household income.
- A hair washing frequency of ≥3 times/week was 8.6–9.5–fold lower in CRCs than in the CLF groups.
- The frequency of shampoo use did not significantly differ between CRCs and CLFs

### Handwashing

- hand washing ≥3 times a day&quot; was reported by a lower percentage of CRCs than of CLFs, regardless of their household income, but the difference was not statistically significant.
- Hand washing after defecating was the most frequent practice in all study groups, even though it was reported by a higher percentage of CLFs than CRCs.

### Oral Hygiene

- Statistically significant results were observed in all oral hygiene items.
- The tooth brushing frequency &quot;≥2 times a day was reported by a lower percentage of CRCs than of CLFs, and the percentage of CLFs increased with higher household incomes.
- The highest frequency of tooth brushing by all of the children was at night (before bedtime
- In addition, 17.6% of CRCs shared their toothbrush with other family members
- There were also significant differences in the type of toothbrush used, with 6% of CRCs reporting the use of an electric toothbrush versus 40% of CLFs
- The frequency of dentist visits during the previous year was significantly lower in CRCs and was greater with higher household income in CLFs

## Patterns in the Overall Findings

- The family (father, mother, or other family member) was most frequently described by all groups of children as having the greatest influence on their personal hygiene learning.
- A significantly higher proportion of CRCs (41.1%) had experienced social rejection for being dirty in comparison to the CLFs (9.5% of those with family incomes 1000 € and around 4% of those with higher family income)
- Very similar differences were observed in the experience of rejection for smelling poorly. Yet, the percentages were slightly higher in all groups, reaching almost 50% in CRCs and between 8.9% and 10.7% in CLFs
- Motivation for hygiene- &quot;to not be rejected by friends,&quot; which was selected by 90% of CRCs versus 58% of CLFs from families with incomes 1000 € and 36% of those from families with higher incomes
- The lower frequency of key personal hygiene practices (body, hair, and hand washing and tooth brushing) in the children from vulnerable families is consistent with reports that implicate the family structure and low parental educational and socioeconomic level in poor health, hygiene, and oral hygiene, behaviors in children
- hand washing was not an established routine in the children, regardless of their family or institutional setting, possibly because it was carried out without the supervision of parents, despite being recommended as a family activity
- The relationship between the physical environment in which children develop and healthy behaviors has also been demonstrated. In the present study, children of vulnerable families were less likely to use a toothbrush (especially an electrical device, that a significant benefit has demonstrated), hand-washing soap, shower gel, or toothpaste, while one in four of them used a washbowl and wet towel or sponge for body washing, which reflects the lack of opportunity to take a bath or shower

## Implications

- the detection of signs of poor personal hygiene practices in children may help professionals anticipate situations of ill health
- These findings suggest the need for educators and healthcare professionals to work together in the design and implementation of strategies to improve the hygiene habits of children from vulnerable families.
- There is a relationship among family vulnerability, diseases associated with poor hygiene (e.g., caries and pediculosis), school problems, and marginalization. However, it appears likely to perpetuate the inequality and vulnerability of these children, with negative consequences for their health in adulthood
- Family interventions have achieved improvements in the acquisition of healthy lifestyles related to physical activity and sport and might, therefore, have a similar impact on personal hygiene habits
- Our findings raise questions about the adequate fulfillment by vulnerable families of their protection, healthcare, and socialization functions
- These findings indicate that the influence of contextual factors and structural mechanisms, which result in the individual&#39;s socioeconomic position and are, therefore, not to be underestimated in a sustainable amelioration of an individual&#39;s health and well-being

## Limitations of the study

- The sample size of children from vulnerable families was reduced due to difficulties in gaining access to this relatively small population, even though it proved possible to obtain significant differences with the children living at home
- There may have been a &quot;volunteer&quot; bias, given the response rate of only 60% for the CLFs.
