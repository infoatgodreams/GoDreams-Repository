# Brief:

* Scope & Description: This report describes the performance of three of the Nonverbal Index subtests from the KABC-II and an adaptation of the CVLT-C for children across five culturally diverse sites, with the objective of seeing if these test strategies are valid indicators of child individual differences that could be affected by events, such as parent death, other trauma, and other events and processes relevant to the child’s subsequent care and education. This report describes the psychometric findings from these tests across child age, education, gender, and site in order to answer questions about the usefulness of these tools across settings in LMIC.

# Need for the study due to Lack of a Gold Standard


* Assessment of children’s learning and performance in low and middle income countries has been critiqued as lacking a gold standard, an appropriate norm reference group, and demonstrated applicability of assessment tasks to the context associated with child age and educational experience across the settings. The tests can be useful in evaluating variability in vulnerable child outcomes
* Study was designed to examine the performance of three nonverbal and one adapted verbal measures of children’s problem solving, memory, motivation, and attention across five culturally diverse sites.
* Researchers conclude that the measures can be successfully employed with fidelity in non-standard settings in LMICs.


## Challenges of Learning assessment for Orphaned and Abandoned Children in LMICs

* The ill effects of being an orphaned or abandoned child (OAC) in a LMIC are reported to include fewer years of schooling, poorer school performance, poorer households, less adequate housing, increased malnutrition, higher morbidity and mortality, poorer access to medical care, and a higher prevalence of depression
* Investigators frequently note that (1) a country-specific norm reference group and/or a pre-disease baseline might have resulted in more informative results and that (2) disease mediated developmental processes are modified also by the environmental context and quality of care.
* The challenges may be notably different from those faced by the growing number of children in LMIC who are separated from one or both parents for economic reasons, including labor migration within and across nations.
* While the latter experience some of the detrimental effects of parental separation and the challenges of variable kinship care, they may also benefit from more household income and the maintenance of an ongoing relationship, albeit more limited, with distant caregivers. 
* Child physical, social emotional, and mental health are the results of a complex and dynamic system of risk and protective factors in health (e.g., cerebral malaria, HIV/AIDS, preventive health care), factors in the care environment (e.g., food insecurity, maltreatment or exploitation, consistency of the primary caregiver) as well as the presence or absence of resiliency (e.g., temperament, intelligence.
* Direct translation approaches have used the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) and the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (KABC)  and, less frequently, the Griffiths Scales  and the McCarthy Scales. 
* Any assessment of learning is called upon to be methodologically relevant in the local context as well as valid in measuring the child’s learning strengths and difficulties relative to his/her age peers
* There are no gold standards for assessing child learning across LMIC; that is, there are no tests developed in LMIC that have been shown to have the same psychometric properties across contexts. When used in large studies that examine multiple domains, the assessment of learning also needs to be relatively brief.
* In addition to the obvious language differences, skills that are germane in Western and more wealthy nations are sometimes thought to be relatively culture dependent in their emphasis on knowledge content and problem solving strategies with which children in LMIC may have less experience or need.


## Approaches to Child Learning in LMIC


* Approaches to testing child learning in LMIC generally fall into one of three categories: (1) use of tools developed and validated in higher income settings, translated for local use, (2) translation of existing tools with adaptation to adjust for local language and customs with the expectation that culturally adjusted measures may capture previously unexamined effects  and (3) strategies created in and for the specific context to be studied in an attempt to address factors in learning presumed more salient in that context
* Team employed and examined the usefulness of brief assessments of learning and cognitive performance in a large study of orphaned and abandoned children in five LMIC.
* This report describes the performance of three of the Nonverbal Index subtests from the KABC-II and an adaptation of the CVLT-C for children across five culturally diverse sites, with the objective of seeing if these test strategies are valid indicators of child individual differences that could be affected by events, such as parent death, other trauma, and other events and processes relevant to the child’s subsequent care and education. This report describes the psychometric findings from these tests across child age, education, gender, and site in order to answer questions about the usefulness of these tools across settings in LMIC.
* Among the choices for using translations of existing tools, the KABC is a tool that, due to its structure and theoretical base, is seen as relatively more applicable across diverse contexts.
* Comparisons of the KABC and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC III) indicated that the KABC is the preferred cognitive assessment across varied cultural settings. 


## Research Design Methods

* In a study of the developmental well being of children orphaned and abandoned in six areas of five LMIC we sought to make use of existing assessment tools to evaluate a series of research questions about the relevance of a child’s living circumstances to overall well-being 


### Positive Outcomes for Orphans

* The California Verbal Learning Test-Children’s Version (CVLT-C) is a measure of children’s executive functioning that is widely used in neuropsychological assessment as an indicator of strengths and deficits related to brain injury, attention, language abilities, and information processing and recall. 
* This report uses cross-sectional baseline data for children age six to 12 years from the longitudinal POFO study to assess the utility and validity of four brief assessments of learning and performance.
* This measure was selected for adaptation for the current study because of its (1) known utility in western settings, (2) its relative ease of administration and limited requirements for complex verbal responses, and (3) the aim of assessing child variability in aspects of executive function, such as attention and motivation. 
* In response to the need for assessment tools that (a) capture learning and performance in children in LMIC, (b) are sensitive to health and psychosocial factors that influence development, (c) are sufficiently brief to be incorporated into ongoing care and/or program evaluation, and (d) can be used in the context of a more general evaluation of health and living circumstances. 
* Pattern Reasoning (PR) is the third KABC-II subtest used. In PR, the child is shown a series of pictures in the form of shapes that vary, for example in terms of shading and spatial rotation, and that form a logical pattern with one picture missing. The child must select the best fit from several picture options. PR requires sustained attention, visual problem solving, and memory
* The fourth task, the Market List (ML), represents an adaptation and abbreviation of the California Verbal Learning Test-Children’s Version (CVLT-C) , chosen to measure children’s executive functioning (attention and motivation) as well as verbal learning and memory. Requiring children to encode, store, and retrieve information, the CVLT-C measures multiple aspects of verbal learning and memory recall and is widely used in assessment of memory, learning, and executive functioning (e.g., attention, impulsivity, encoding strategies), all of which represent foundation skills for complex learning typically encountered in a formal educational setting.


## Test Procedures 



* The scores from three nonverbal subtests from the Second Edition of the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, 2nd edition (KABC-II)  and from the Market List,an abbreviated adaptation of the California Verbal Learning Test-Children’s Version (CVLT-C)  are examined for their efficiency in indicating the child’s level of learning and performance.
* These particular assessments were selected in an effort to mitigate issues about the cultural dependence and transferability of cognitive and learning measures that were developed and used in more wealthy nations and may involve assumptions about the generalizability of verbal knowledge and problem solving.
* The categories used in the original CVLT-C (things a child would eat, wear, and play with) were used to maximize consistency with the original test (See Market Lists for Cambodia, India, and the three African countries.
* For the purpose of our study of orphans and abandoned children, three subtests less dependent on language differences were chosen from the KABC-II Nonverbal Index.
* The first of these, Hand Movements (HM), involves the child copying the examiner on a series of Hand Movements using fist, palm, or side of the hand. HM provides an indicator of the child’s sequential processing, attention, and short term memory through visual-motor abilities. We found the children in our settings to be highly interested and engaged with the study.
* The second KABC-II subtest, Triangles (TR), requires the child to assemble plastic and foam forms to match a model constructed by the examiner or shown in a picture. The test evaluates the child’s abilities with visual motor integration and spatial reasoning; and as stimulus forms become more complex, they require more advanced reasoning and problem.
* Given that KABC-II norms are based on a United States sample and the importance of avoiding the direct comparison of child learning across countries and cultures, raw scores were used to indicate the child’s performance relative to his/her age, as well as other variables that could affect learning, such as highest level achieved in formal education.


# Results of the study


## Description of Participating Children


* Child ages ranged from 6.0 to 12.9 years, with no statistically significant differences among sites.
* The educational levels achieved by the children was significantly different across sites (F = 23.97; P\0.0001), with the lowest educational levels sampled in Kenya and the highest in Ethiopia.


##  Scores on the Tests of Learning and Performance 

* Possible scores ranged from 0 to 23 for Hand Movements, 0 to 27 for Triangles, 0 to 36 for Pattern Reasoning, and 0 to 15 for the Market Lists.
* The KABC-II subtest Triangles scores showed the greatest variability across sites (F = 37.69; R2 = 0.11; P\0.0001) with the highest scores found in Cambodia and the lowest in Tanzania.
* The primary hypothesis tested is: does child performance on the four selected tests of learning improve systematically and across sites with age and education and, thereby, provide an index of the child’s learning ability and achievement relative to his/her age peers.
* The correlations among KABC-II subtests in the current study are generally consistent with those of KABCII subtest scores in the U.S. standardization sample.
* The child’s highest level of education is also associated with the scores on all four tests (r2 0.15–0.29; all P\0.001.). For each level of education attained by the child, the scores also increase by approximately 1/2 point for Hand Movements and Market list and 1 point for Triangles and Pattern Reasoning.
* Bivariable analyses also indicate gender differences on the Triangles subtest, with boys scoring higher than girls, (r2 = 0.01; P\0.001) and on the Market List, with girls scoring higher than boys (r2 = 0.01; P\0.05.)


## Do Child Age, Education, and Gender Predict Learning and Performance Scores Across Sites 



* The results indicate that age is significantly and positively associated with raw scores on all four tests (r2 0.11–0.18; all P\0.001.
* The findings from these sensitivity analyses suggested that although all of these factors varied across the five sites, they did not alter the observed significant association between education and performance on the four tests.


## Discussion on factors affecting learning and growth in LMIC Orphanage children



* The five sites were queried about these findings, and both African and Asian interviewers indicated that the results were likely related to the different roles of boys and girls in their settings e.g., ‘‘Boys have more time for playing, innovation, and creativity than girls who help in household chores’’, ‘‘Girls’ play is more geared toward ‘‘cha mama’’, that is, imitating the mother and her duties, like cooking, buying things at the market, and running the household.
* The results suggest that these tests of learning can be done in LMIC in non-standard settings and that they are, as predicted, associated with child age and even more strongly with the child’s formal educational experience despite the diversity among site.
* Given that the child’s experience in formal education in these five countries makes a large contribution to the child’s performance on the tests, is formal education increasing intellectual ability or is there other learning in school that is associated with child performance? In other words, tests drawn or derived from standard IQ tests may not always index static cognitive capacity but also non-cognitive learning skills and behavior that are strongly influenced by educational opportunities.
* It is concluded that this type of brief assessment, based on tests derived in countries with higher socioeconomic status, is applicable for understanding child individual differences in contexts in which learning is a function of not only age and innate abilities but also of highly variable opportunities for learning.
* One hypothesis about these findings comes from studies of preschool programs in the United States in which Heckman and colleagues conclude that formal education contributes to non-cognitive skills as well as to cognitive abilities per se and that non-cognitive abilities learned in formal education can contribute even more to successful lives in school and in adulthood. 
* Significant interactions were present between educational level and site as test score predictors, indicating that the effect of educational level varies across the five sites, a finding that remained significant after statistically controlling for child site, age, and gender highly variable in consistency, quality, and attendance within and across the five nations in the study.
* The argument is made that innate cognitive ability is only one aspect of child developmental outcomes and that these so-called ‘‘non-cognitive’’ abilities are also developed in the family and in school where the child learns to attend, to be motivated to achieve, and to play by the rules of the setting. 
* On the other hand, the adapted CVLT may provide an easy-to-administer indicator of not only verbal memory but also the child’s motivation and attention, that is, factors that may improve with interventions that address a number of factors, such as nutrition, psychosocial well being, and access to education.
* If applicable to LMIC settings, it follows that the child who performs on these tests, with items never before encountered in their context, with enthusiasm, motivation, and attention is a child who not only has the intellectual capacity but also who learned these (non-cognitive) skills in school and may be more likely to use these skills to negotiate a more successful adolescence and adulthood. 
* In summary, the valid assessment of learning in diverse settings is challenged by the complexity of child development, the relevance of cultural differences in child performance, in variable formal education, and in adult priorities for child learning, as well as the lack of tests developed for and in the context to be studied. 


## Limitations

* There exists no gold standard assessment of child learning in these contexts, which limits conclusions about validity of our test protocol but also argues for the need to do and report these kinds of studies. 
* These data are cross-sectional in nature, and we cannot infer causality or exclude other possible influences on scores, such as administration variability or quality of schooling. 
* Indeed, formal education itself is highly variable in consistency, quality, and attendance within and across the five nations in the study.
* On the other hand, the adapted CVLT may provide an easy-to-administer indicator of not only verbal memory but also the child’s motivation and attention, that is, factors that may improve with interventions that address a number of factors, such as nutrition, psychosocial well being, and access to education.
