# Brief:
* Scope & Description: This article presents a brief scoping review of the literature on the educational outcomes of care experienced children and young people in Australia published since 2010. The review also examines key educational issues and the impact of being in care on the educational experience of children and young people. The review found that young people in care often experience much worse educational outcomes than their peers. Conclusions and recommendations include reforming the care and education systems, focussing workers on building strong supportive relationships with young people, helping them to build resilience and prioritising education.

# Education and children in out-of-home care (OHC): 

* OHC includes foster care, kinship care, residential care, family group homes and independent living (AIHW, 2020).
* In the UK, it is evident that looked after children were being failed by the education system as far back as the 1980s. When data started to be collected, the clearest indicator of this was the number of children leaving care with no school qualifications of any kind (Jackson et al., 2005). 
* A 2008 literature review published in the USA found that children in OHC demonstrated several academic risks, which was partly caused by multiple disruptions in schooling due to changes in placements
* Research also indicates that children in care in Canada have poorer educational outcomes than their same age peers (Dill et al., 2012; Flynn et al., 2012)
* Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) data has long indicated that children in care have lower reading and numeracy test scores than their peers (AIHW, 2007; 2011). A 2007 study looked at 47 young people discharged from care in NSW in the 1990s. The study found that these young people were half more likely to have finished Year 12 than their peers in the general population. Almost 20% of the care leavers involved in the study had not completed Year 10 (Cashmore et al., 2007).
* An important finding is that some young people in OHC do have successful educational outcomes. They are the young people who are participating in or have completed a post-secondary qualification at university or other institution. 
* There are common themes among those who have done well. These include good relationships with and support from key adults, and a sense of resilience combined with high aspirations and persistence. A stable placement while attending a good school in the final years of secondary education also helps. 
* In one study, two young people reported that being in care had positive impacts on their educational and life experiences, although many others commented on the school disruption that placement changes caused (Tilbury et al., 2014). Similarly, Townsend et al. (2016) found that some children experienced coming into care as positive for both their wellbeing and schooling, while others found it more difficult 
* Another study found that being in care was overwhelmingly a protective factor, with 25 ofthe 26 young people involved reporting that coming into care had helped them in their education and in their lives (Sebba et al., 2017).
* Socio-economic backgrounds of children in care: 
    * There are some similarities in the socio-economic backgrounds of children in care, with many of them coming from families experiencing poverty and social exclusion, or with mental health or substance abuse problems. 
    * Other issues include a lack of integration between the care and education systems, school changes due to placement disruption, lack of support from responsible adults and stigma 
    * Early research from Australia also points to children entering care because of neglect linked to social disadvantage as well as abuse. 


# Key Issues and Outcomes in Children and Young People in Care:

* Outcomes for children in care are worse than their peers in the general population. Research is equivocal about whether their outcomes are worse than other children from similarly disadvantaged backgrounds
* For many children and young people, key issues are around the importance of good relationships with supportive adults whether those adults are foster carers, teachers and school staff or case workers. 
* Adverse key issues include placement changes and associated school disruptions, particularly in the last years of school. Stigma associated with care status is another important issue contributing to low expectations of young people in care by others. 
* Many young people want to control who knows their care status and to be listened to and included in planning. Other young people talked about their own efforts and had a sense of agency or taking control. For care leavers at university this was described as resilience, persistence and motivation. 
* Further critical issues raised by carers, social workers and service providers include chronic disengagement and systemic issues, including a lack of skills and training for school staff, inadequate training and support for carers and caseworkers, lack of focus on education within care systems, inadequate resourcing, administrative and managerial pressures on practice and poor communication between agencies 
* ## Impact of social deprivation and trauma:
    * Children and young people in care have almost universally had a difficult start in life. 
    * Most children in care are from socially disadvantaged backgrounds, often from families with high numbers of contacts with mental health and alcohol and other drug treatment services. 
    * Many children have experienced significant trauma, and this can have long-term impact on educational engagement and outcomes.
* ## Stigma and Low expectations
    * The stigma of being in care is addressed in several studies and in all of these studies young people expressed a desire to be able to control who knew about their care status. They also wished to be treated just like young people who are not in care
    * Stigma is closely linked to low expectations. One study describes the ‘soft bigotry of low expectations’ and notes that the children in care might lower their educational aspirations to match the lower expectations of those around them. 
    * Wilson et al. (2019) use the stark example of a young person who was discouraged from sitting at a scholarship exam because she wasn’t perceived as being good enough. 
    * Researchers point to the importance of adults having high expectations for children in care and encouraging young people to develop high aspirations for their future.
* ## School disruption and absenteeism
    * The impact of the school disruption often caused by placement changes is another theme addressed in several studies. This is a contested topic, with some research showing multiple school changes contribute to poor educational outcomes, and other studies showing they have negligible impact. 
    * Lima et al. (2018) found that young people in care with more than five placements were more likely to have poorer educational outcomes than those with fewer than five placements 
    * Research focussing on care leavers described school changes as a problem (Harvey et al., 2017), which is supported by evidence from an international scoping review (Luke &O’Higgins, 2018) which found that multiple placements are detrimental to educational outcomes.
    * Research focusing on the opinions and views of children and young people indicates that school changes are an issue for them because it disrupts relationships with their peers and teachers and influences both their experience and engagement of school. Chronic disengagement is a key factor in absenteeism, which is another issue raised in some studies (Association of Children’s Welfare Agencies [ACWA].
    * In contrast, other studies showed that children in care had better attendance than their vulnerable peers, and that regular school attendance is a key protective factor for educational outcomes.
    * The evidence suggests that regardless of outcomes measured by test results, children and young people usually find placement and school changes disruptive and upsetting, particularly in the final years of schooling. 
    * Placement changes and associated issues of school disruption and absenteeism are often due to issues within the care or education systems or lack of integration between them
* ## Care and education system
    * Some authors noted issues within schools including the lack of implementation of Individual Education Plans (IEP) and the lack of skills among school staff to support children with complex trauma backgrounds
    * Research also highlights issues in the care system, including a lack of support and training, inclusion in planning for carers, training for caseworkers. Other issues include unclear funding guidelines, poor communication between agencies and inadequate education resources. 
    * Caseworkers raised issues around lack of time spent with children due to the reactive and regulatory focus of their work, also reporting that their emphasis was on the psychological needs of young people rather than education
    * A number of studies reported that children and young people in care were concerned they weren’t being listened to or involved in decision making about education or things that affected their education. Other authors noted a lack of integration between the care and education systems and how this negatively impacts on education.
* ## Managing transitions
    * The research suggests there are issues at each level of educational transitions. 
    * Research on Australian care leavers emphasised the need for further support beyond the age of 18 and positive interventions to make the transition to tertiary study easier. 
    * Other issues include the need for care leavers transitioning to university to be included in equity frameworks, and the need for better data collection about care leavers.
* ## Importance of relationship and agency
    * Many of the papers stress the importance of a good relationship with at least one supportive adult. Other themes emerging included relationships being the most significant influence in career development for young people and the importance in a young person’s life of a relationship with a significant adult who values learning and provides emotional support to the young person.
    * An international review suggests that caregiver involvement in schooling is associated with better outcomes.
    * Relationships with key adults can contribute to building resilience in young people with adverse experiences 
    * One study found that many young people regarded their own efforts as central to their possible success. In another study, individual agency was a key theme. Many young people took an active role in their educational progress and felt it was up to them.
    * Matheson’s(2016) study directly addresses personal factors and found that care leavers in tertiary education had high aspirations and a sense of resilience, although many also felt luck played a role in their educational success. 
    * Key themes from two further studies were the student’s sense of resilience and their motivation and determination to succeed.

# Recommendations to improve educational outcomes for children and young people in OHC:
* Stigma and low expectations can perhaps be best addressed through awareness raising and better education of agency and school staff. 
* School disruption and other issues raised in the literature tend to reflect issues in the care systems and the way resources are allocated, managed and prioritised. 
* Much of the research includes recommendations about providing better services to young people by better training of staff, stabilising placements, reviewing corporate parenting practices, better integration of the care and education systems, valuing education and providing more support for young people transitioning out of the care system
* There is a need for all workers in the sector to be aware of and trained to manage the ongoing impacts of trauma on children and young people in care. 
* Workers should also try to minimise placement changes that lead to school disruption, especially in the final years of school. They should contribute to a culture that values education, supports young people to build resilience and has high expectations of them.
* The findings of this scoping review are not new findings. The 2010 report which informed the National Standards for OHC raised similar issues around stability, supporting transition from care, better training and support for carers and workers, improvements in practice and relationships, more inclusive decision making and improved access to support services.
