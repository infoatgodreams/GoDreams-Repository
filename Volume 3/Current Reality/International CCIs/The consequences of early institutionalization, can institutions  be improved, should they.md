# Brief:

* Scope & Description: The focus of this review is on institutionalized children, one of the most inequitably and severely treated groups of children. Although institutions vary, many share some common characteristics, including large groups, high children: caregiver ratios, many and changing caregivers, and caregiver-child interactions that lack warm, sensitive, contingently responsive, and child-directed behaviors. It appears that caregiver-child interactions are a major contributor to children’s outcomes, and interventions in institutions that improve such interactions produce substantial increases in children’s physical, mental, and social-emotional development, including for children with disabilities.

# Children living in institutional care: 

* There are no systematic, representative, and accurate data available, but estimates suggest from 2 (USAID, 2009) to 8 million (Human Rights Watch, 1999) children live in institutions worldwide. 
* Most of these are in Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Africa; there are fewer, but they also exist in Western Europe and North America. Unfortunately, the number of children residing in institutions is increasing, in part because of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, plus a decline in international adoptions, in part because of reported corruption, profiteering, and inadequate monitoring of adopted children’s well-being.
* Child-caregiver ratio within an institution:
    * Children are typically raised in large groups (Ns = 9–16 ), but some wards can house 50–60 infants in a single room. 
    * Children: caregiver ratios tend to be high, roughly 6–8  to 1, and sometimes higher, even in wards of young infants.
    *  Further, there are many and changing caregivers, some of whom may work long shifts (24 hours) and then are off for three days. This caregiver scheduling, turnover, vacations that may be as high as 50–60 days per year, plus ward transitions mean that children can experience 60–100 different caregivers by the time they are 19 months old (St. Petersburg-USA Orphanage Research Team, 2008). 
    * Finally, and perhaps most importantly, caregiver-child interactions tend to be limited, perfunctory, and business-like with a minimum of warm, sensitive, responsive interactions.

## Development of children living in institutional care:
- Meta-analyses of numerous studies indicate that institutionalized children average 1.0–1.5 standard deviations below the mean for parent-reared children with respect to physical growth and behavioral/mental development as well as displaying a variety of social and behavioral problems. 
- Institutionalized children also commonly display certain specific behaviors that are rare among parent-reared children, such as:
	- stereotypies or self-stimulation (e.g., rocking, head banging, arm waving), 
	- problems with attention and activity control, 
	- internalizing and externalizing behavior, 
	- high rates of disorganized or unscoreable attachment on the Strange Situation Procedure, 
	- and indiscriminate friendliness. 
- One study (Zeanah et al., 2009) has systematically assessed psychiatric disorders at 54 months of age in contemporary Bucharest institutions, finding three to four times as many institutionalized children as parent-reared children displaying any psychiatric disorder, any externalizing and internalizing disorder, ADHD, oppositional defiant or conduct disorder, and any anxiety disorder.

## Role of exposure to institutions and age of adoption in development of children leaving institutional care:
- Only a few studies have explored the specific form of the association between ages of exposure and subsequent development 
    * **First**, children exposed to institutions, including very severely deficient institutions, between birth and 6  months of age, do not display long-term deficiencies and problems at rates any higher than parent-reared children in the adoptive country, at least for the outcomes measured to date. 
    * **Second**, the risk of long-term deficiencies and problems increases rather precipitously in a step function of age at adoption, the latter often used as a surrogate for time in the institution. 
    * **Third**, the age at which the risk of long-term problems increases precipitously is earlier for children from very severely deficient institutions and somewhat later for those from less severely deficient institutions. Specifically, the rate increases after only 6 months for children from the very severely deficient 1990’s Romanian institutions, 18 months for children from less severely deficient St. Petersburg (Russian Federation) orphanages, and 24–27 mos. for children from a variety of institutions especially including children from China and South Korea who are thought to have had better early experiences. 
    * **Fourth**, once the risk increases, more prolonged exposure to the institution does not increase the risk, for a variety of behavior problems and executive functioning. 
    * These four principles undoubtedly depend in part on which outcomes are considered and how they are measured. For example, language deficiencies may arise more slowly during the second year and prolonged exposure may continue to limit general mental performance 
    * Children that get adopted at an early age: 
        * If children leave the institution at a relatively early age, research has yet to demonstrate any lasting effect of having been institutionalized early in their lives. 
        * That is, such children do not display developmental deficiencies or behavioral problems at rates higher than would be expected of parent-reared children in their adoptive country.
    * Children that get adopted at a later age:
        * Conversely, if children are adopted at a later age, the rates of deficient development and problems increase substantially in most domains.
        * Specifically, post-institutionalized (PI) children who have spent a more prolonged period of time in deficient institutions can have atypical brain development, especially in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, areas of the brain that have been linked with behavioral deficiencies and problems that are common in PI children. 
        * For example, they have higher rates of poorer executive functioning (i.e., attention, short-term memory, cognitive control/inhibition, sequencing and planning), higher rates of hyperactivity and quasi-autism, poorer emotional regulation, more anxiety, poorer attachment, more indiscriminate friendliness, and more comorbidity of these problems.


# Possible theories for deficient development in institutionalised children:

## Attachment theory:
 Early observations of institutionalized children by Burlingham and Freud (1944), Bowlby (1951), and Spitz (1945) provoked the speculation that such children lacked ‘mothering’ and the opportunity to form an attachment relationship with a caregiver. 
 Further, the many and changing caregivers that such children experience limit the likelihood that they would readily develop conceptual models of their environment and how to behave effectively in it, and the lack of appropriate caregiving would also minimize their opportunities to develop self-regulation of their emotions and behavior. 
 Consistent evidence includes the finding that institutionalized children rarely have organized or secure attachment relationships, and the few studies that have assessed relationships with the Strange Situation Procedure or a modification of it show that nearly three-fourths of institutionalized children have a disorganized or unscoreable attachment category. So, indeed, institutionalized children lack even organized, to say nothing of secure, attachment relationships with caregivers. 
 Further, the lack of a caregiver-child attachment relationship would seem to deny institutionalized children much of the stimulation and experiences that would likely contribute to typical development.
 The many and changing caregivers contribute to inconsistency in the child’s interactions with caregivers, and peers are perhaps even more inconsistent. There is a lack of experience with contingencies of any kind, because caregiving duties are often done TO rather than WITH the infant, and caregiver interactions are often caregiver rather than child–directed. Thus children have few experiences that would promote the perception of effectiveness or agency with the environment. Children are allowed to cry without being attended, so there is little opportunity to learn self-regulation
 Kreppner et al., (2007) reported that the risk for multiple long-term problems increased precipitously after only 6 months of exposure to the severely deficient 1990’s Romanian orphanages. This seems to suggest that whatever corrosive elements are operating in the institutional environment they can have an effect very early, presumably before the infant has an opportunity to develop a mature relationship with a caregiver. Six-month infants do not have object permanency, so while they are capable of recognizing a caregiver, out of sight is out of mind
 Further, more institutionalized children lack an attachment relationship than have long-term multiple problems, so something else is needed to explain why some children who lack early attachment relationships nevertheless do not develop long-term problems.

## Chronic stress hypothesis:
- Chronic stress is widely invoked as a possible explanation of the consequences for children of prolonged exposure to a great variety of atypical and extreme environments, including those ACAMH members commonly experience in their clinical practice. 
- Consequently, institutionalized infants and young children should have higher levels of cortisol, a chemical produced by the body in response to chronic stress, and their hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system would become dysregulated 
- Dysregulated HPA systems have been shown to produce a number of biological consequences, including suppressing the production of growth hormones which might explain the growth failure of institutionalized children, suppressing the effectiveness of immunizations leading to lower levels of antibodies that may lead to poorer health, and altering brain development (prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala) which may be associated with poorer mental performance, executive functioning, and emotional control.


# Need for improving Institutions:

* Most such children display substantial catch-up growth, often starting soon after adoption, in many general physical and behavioral (mental, social) domains, although the extent of catch-up may be more limited in some areas (i.e., gross motor, memory, executive functioning)
* Institutional environment makes a substantial contribution to the delayed and adverse development of children within the institution, and that such poor development is not primarily associated with selected gene pool, adverse perinatal circumstances, and pre-institutional experience.
* Advocates fear that improving institutions will deflect attention, energy, and resources of a country away from developing a family care alternative system.
* At least one study indicates that in terms of development, even children reared in families with substantial risk may be better than those reared in institutions as typically practiced.
* But other research demonstrates that community residential care is associated with better children’s outcomes than family care (predominantly kinship), at least for children 6–12 years of age in five low resource countries.
* Family care:
    * Family care has many advantages in many cultures, but it cannot be simply dropped into a country without regard to the circumstances of that locale. 
    * Further, whatever system a country adopts, it is likely to need a professional social work/child welfare infrastructure to implement and support it. One cannot simply throw financial incentives at individuals to rear children; technical expertise and support is needed.
    * Although there is some cost to implementing a family care system (and some cost to changing institutions), once established family care is clearly cheaper to maintain and operate than institutions. 
    * Finally, a review of research on family vs. institutional care as currently practiced reveals that children’s outcomes are generally better for family care (i.e., adoption, foster care) than institutions.
    * Challenges in its implementation
        * Cultural and religious aversions:
            * There may be cultural, political, historical aversions within a country to rearing someone else’s child, and there may be religious prohibitions against adoption. The result can be difficulty recruiting families to adopt or foster children. 
        * Appropriate incentives for parents:
            * Creating appropriate incentives for parents to adopt or foster children is more difficult than it appears. For example, most countries are reluctant to pay parents to adopt children, despite the fact that adoption is the best alternative for such children. 
            * Also, providing financial incentives for low-income, single, or teenage mothers to keep their children simultaneously rewards having children out of wedlock, and some couples may deliberately not marry to receive such benefits. 
        * Lack of professional social work infrastructure:
            * In addition, a professional social work infrastructure is needed to create an appropriate selection process for picking adoptive or foster parents, training them, monitoring and supporting them in the field, and helping them cope with the inevitable problems that some children from institutions are likely to have. 
        * Age of children getting adopted:
            * Finally, typically developing infants and young children are likely to be placed in families first, which means that older children and those with disabilities are more likely to be left in the institutions while a comprehensive family care system is being developed
* A case example:The St. Petersberg-USA Orphanage Intervention
    * The preponderance of circumstantial evidence and comparisons of children randomly assigned to foster care vs. institutionalization suggest that institutionalized children’s delayed development and long-term deficiencies and problems are likely more associated with the caregiving environment than with a variety of other potential confounds, such as a selected gene pool of the children who are sent to orphanages, perinatal risk circumstances, pre-institutional experience, and poor nutrition, sanitation, medical care.
    * The intervention had two major components:
        * one was to train caregivers and encourage them to behave with the children in a more typical parental style (i.e., ‘love these children’) 
        * the second was to change the institutional environment and employment patterns to support caregiver-child interactions by making the institution more ‘family-like’
    * The HOME inventory was used to measure the physical and the behavioral environment on the wards.
    * The three institutional conditions:
        * **T+SC:**The training and structural changes were implemented in one institution for children from birth to 4 years of age, although many left between 1 and 3 years of age. This condition was labeled T+SC, for Training Plus Structural Changes. 
        * **TO**: A second institution received Training Only, called TO, and 
        * **NOI**: a third institution received No Intervention, called NoI. 
    * Children’s development:
        * T+SC and TO children, both typically developing and those with disabilities, increased in height, weight, and chest circumference. Typically developing T SC and TO children progressively displayed fewer functional limitations. 
        * Behavioral and mental development were assessed with the Battelle Developmental Inventory, and developmental quotients (DQs) increased for T+SC children from an average of 57 to 92=35 DQ points, perhaps the largest average increase in behavioral/mental development observed for any intervention in the literature. Children with disabilities rose from 23 to 42=19 DQ points on average, 27% of these children increased more than 30 points, and 14% increased more than 40 points.
        * In caregiver-child free play sessions, typically developing T SC and TO children displayed a higher quality of play, alertness, and self-regulation than NoI, and T SC children showed more positive affect, social initiative, and communication than TO and NoI children – again more the longer they were in the intervention
        * A mediational analysis demonstrated that 43% of children’s better behavioral/mental development was mediated by the better caregiving environment as reflected on the HOME inventory.
    * Recommendations from the case sample: 
        * The St. Petersburg intervention demonstrates that institutions do not need to operate in the way most do and that encouraging caregivers to interact more appropriately with children in an environment that is made more family-like can produce very substantial improvements in the development of resident infants and toddlers
        * A recent study (McCall et al., in press) indicates that the T SC institution has maintained for at least six years the same quality of care as reflected on the HOME as it had during the intervention 
        * Interestingly, the DQs of children in all three institutions improved over the six-year period, perhaps because fewer children were sent to institutions but staff levels remained the same producing smaller groups and fewer children per caregiver in all three of the institutions (McCall et al., in press).
        * These results and those of similar interventions indicate that institutions can be improved; the improvements can produce substantial increases in physical, mental, social, and behavioral development in both typically developing children and those with disabilities; and such benefits can be maintained for at least six years with no additional funds
