# What is play?
* Any activity that the child finds enjoyable is play. The same activity can be play or work for different people.
* Play is enjoyable for its own sake, it is its own reward. Play activities provide satisfaction to children.
* Play is that activity in which participation is spontaneous and of the child's own will.


# **Additional aspects of play:**



* Children take their play very seriously. Any interference or change made in their activity by someone who is not participating is not appreciated.
* Evidence from studies reveals that children who have no ties for play and stimulation lag behind in all areas of development.

### Role of the caregiver in play

* The caregiver is needed to help the children understand their discoveries.
* The caregiver can extend the child's discovery.
* The caregiver should provide opportunities for discovery.
* The caregiver does not always have to wait for the children to discover something. They can plan children's activities in such a way that they lead to discovery.
* The caregiver can draw the child's attention to the possibilities the child may have missed during play. 


## **ROLE OF PLAY IN DEVELOPMENT:**

### Play Promotes Cognitive Development
- Play allows children to discover and learn for themselves. The child learns what they are cognitively ready to learn. This is also related to the fact that what the child finds stimulating depends upon their cognitive skill. 
- In play children have the freedom to choose things which are of interest to them. They will choose those activities for play that are neither too simple nor too tough as these would be challenging and interesting. In this way they learn things that they are ready to learn. It must be emphasized that play helps children to learn by doing.


### Play Promotes Imagination and Creativity
- In play children imagine what it is to be like someone else - to feel, act, think, work and behave like them. The child is thus learning the appropriate behaviour by imitating during play. 
- Play does not have to be a mirror of reality. Rather, it provides a flexible situation which allows the child to be creative. It nurtures imagination which helps the child to deal with day-to-day situations.


### Play Promotes Physical and Motor Development


### Play Helps in Acquiring Language
- The playful interactions with caregivers give the child plenty of opportunities to hear the language and motivate them to speak.


### Through Play the Child Learns to be Social

- In the first few months, the interactions of the caregiver with the infant help the child to recognize the caregiver and to develop an attachment with them. This is the infant's first social relationship which has a lasting impact on future relationships with people. 
- During the first year of life, the baby plays with and explores their own body and things within their immediate reach. This helps them to understand that their body is separate from other objects in the surroundings and **leads to the development of the concept of self**. 
- As the child grows older, they play with other children and learn to share, follow the rules of the game and wait for their turn to play. Thus they begin to learn to take into consideration another person's point of view.


### Play Helps in Emotional Development

- Children's play provides them opportunities to express delight, joy, anger, fear, distress and other emotions.
- Play allows expression of feelings and emotions which may not be allowed in other situations. 
- Play is also used as a treatment or a therapy for children who do not show normal emotional reactions to situations.


## **PLAY AS A MEANS OF UNDERSTANDING CHILDREN'S DEVELOPMENT: 

* When play is not being controlled by adults children are not inhibited or conscious and, therefore, one can see them at their best.
* Play activities help us to know about the child's cognitive abilities.
* Play also reflects the child's social development.


## **PLAY AND LEARNING:**

This section looks at the reasons that play should be a medium for learning for children

* **In Infancy Thought Develops Through Activity:**  As an infant the only way the child can learn is by doing an activity and finding out for themself. In the early years learning of social, cognitive, language and motor skills is possible only through play.
* **Children Learn by Doing:** Instead of being allowed to do an activity, if the child was merely told about the concept, it would not be so clear to them. 
* **Play Holds the Child's Attention: **Play involves the children physically and holds their attention in one activity for longer periods and, therefore, aids learning. 
* **Learning Through Play is Fun: **It is only fair that we help children learn through ways they enjoy and make learning a stimulating and rewarding experience for them. Play, therefore, is an enjoyable medium through which children learn things they are ready to learn.


## KINDS OF PLAY:

Some classifications take the play space into consideration. Some are based on the content of the activity and others on the skills needed for the play activity. All play leads to learning.

* Free and structured play: Both kinds of play are essential for children. Free play helps to sustain curiosity and initiative and fosters discovery. Structured play, because of the role of the caregiver, helps to draw the attention of the child to various aspects which they may miss during free play.
* Outdoor and Indoor play
* Individual and group play: Group play fosters in the child social skills necessary for interaction with others. Individual play gives the child time to work on things that they find most interesting and helps them to develop their skills.
* Vigorous and quiet play: Children enjoy play activities that require them to spend a lot of energy. These activities are called vigorous play activities. Play that does not involve too much physical activity helps the child to relax and regain some energy spent during vigorous games. nese play activities are called quiet play.
* Sensorimotor and symbolic play: In infancy children play with things in the environment that are within reach. The activities involve the senses and require motor coordination and are referred to as sensorimotor play.Towards the end of infancy the child begins to take part in 'pretend play’ this kind of play requires the cognitive ability to use things and people as symbols. The transition from sensorimotor to symbolic play is based on an increasing complexity in children's thought.


## **FACTORS AFFECTING PLAY:**

* Age
* Gender
* Culture
* Social Class
* Ecology and Setting
* Media
* Quality of experience


## **SUMMING UP:**

- Children’s participation in play is spontaneous and active. Children find play satisfying in itself. Play is the best medium of learning for children because they enjoy it. In play children learn by doing and this also helps to retain their attention to one activity. During infancy it is only through play that learning takes place.
- The age, gender, social class, ecology, culture, media  and quality of experience influence the kind of play activities children choose. Play is also determined by the space, time and materials available for play. A caregiver who is aware of the importance of play activities for children can provide an environment conducive to play irrespective of their  economic status, educational background or ecological setting.
