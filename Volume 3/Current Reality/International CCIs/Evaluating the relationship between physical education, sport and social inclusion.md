# Brief:

* **Scope & Description:** 

    Attention is paid to potential contributions that such activities can make towards social inclusion and the development of social capital. This review suggests that there are some areas for which there is a considerable amount of evidence in favour of a positive relationship with participation in these activities (such as physical and mental health) and others such as cognitive and academic development, crime reduction, truancy and disaffection.

# Introduction: 


## Physical education v/s Sports


* **Physical education:** ‘Physical education’ is a statutory area of the school curriculum, concerned with developing pupils’ physical competence and confidence, and their ability to use these to perform in a range of activities.
* Whilst the performance of physical skills forms a central and characteristic feature of the subject, like all other areas of the curriculum, it is fundamentally concerned with knowledge.
* physical education is concerned with learning the skills and understanding required for participation in physical activities, knowledge of one’s own body and its range of and capacity for movement.
* wide range of outcomes; valuable extrinsic educational lessons, such as social skills, aesthetic judgement, literacy and numeracy.
* **Sports:** ‘Sport**’** is a collective noun and usually refers to a range of activities, processes, social relationships and presumed physical, psychological and sociological outcomes.
* Sport means all forms of physical activity which, through casual or organised participation, aim at expressing or improving physical fitness and mental well-being, forming relationships or obtaining results in competitions at all levels.
* distinction between the terms is simply that ‘sport’ refers to a range of activities and ‘physical education’ refers to an area of the school curriculum concerned with physical activities and the development of physical competence.


## Policies (specific to the UK)

The following presentation of policy agenda is limited to data upto 2005. 

* UK Government proposed , ‘A Sporting Future for All’, provides a recognition of the importance of these activities in terms of personal enjoyment and fulfilment, there has been an increasing emphasis upon sport’s potential contribution to a host of wider benefits.
* The most common extrinsic justification for increasing levels of participation in physical education and sport, especially for children and young people, is the association with improved health.


### Movement of policies from health benefits to social inclusion.

* The urgency with which policy-makers have embraced the physical activity/health connection has only increased with a growing anxiety that some children and young people are not sufficiently active to accrue health benefits.
* An increased risk of ‘hypokinetic diseases’ such as coronary heart disease, obesity, hypertension, osteoporosis and diabetes, which can have their origin in childhood (Bailey, 1999). 
* More recently, policy-makers have begun to stress the social dimensions of sports participation, although claims of pro-social outcomes form an established tradition within both curricular physical education.


### Benefits of social inclusion through sports


*  The report to the Social Exclusion Unit from the Policy Action Team 10 suggests that sport (and the arts) can contribute to ‘neighbourhood renewal by improving communities’ “performance” on four key indicators—health, crime, employment and education’.
* Sport England (1999) contribution to this ‘new policy agenda’ by contributing to a wide range of positive social outcomes, including reduced youth crime, improved fitness and health, reduced truancy, improved attitudes to learning among young people and the provision of opportunities for ‘active citizenship’.
* UK’s recent portfolio of projects to address social disadvantage amongst children and young people are essentially concerned with increasing social capital. 
    * Sure Start, an early intervention programme; 
    * Children’s Fund, designed to support vulnerable and at-risk children.


## What is social capital?

* Notion of social capital that emerges is concerned with the role of social networks and civic norms, and is closely linked with concepts of trust, community and civic engagement.
* Emphasis is placed on social processes and on ways to enhance the organisational capacities of communities.
* Bourdieu discussed the relationships between cultural and social reproduction by drawing upon ill-defined conceptions of capital—cultural, linguistic, scholastic and social.
* Coleman’s work in this area originated with his interest in the relationship between educational attainment and social inequality.
* Coleman offered a definition of social capital that makes clear its relevance to our present discussion; he defined it as ‘the set of resources that inhere in family relations and in community social organisation and that are useful for the cognitive or social development of a child or young person’ 
* He saw social capital arising mainly from activities intended for other purposes. As such, ‘there is often little or no direct investment in social capital’.
* Putnam, social capital is essentially about social networks, and these are most effectively developed through participation in shared activities.
* Putnam’s empirical work is concerned with state-level analysis of social capital, and he identifies impressive correlations between high levels of social capital and a host of desirable outcomes, such as lower crime rates, higher levels of economic prosperity, improved health and improved educational attainment.
* His analysis centres on a set of indicators of social networks, which he implicitly equates to social capital (Putnam, 2000).

    **KEY TAKEAWAY: **uniting theme- ‘social cohesion’, which is addressed through creating or strengthening the physical, social and cultural infrastructures of communities. Investment, when it occurs, is made in programmes and processes which develop skills, confidence, self-organisational capacity and strengthen social networks (Putnam, 2000). 


    Since sports participation provides a focus for social activity, an opportunity to make friends, develop networks and reduce social isolation, it seems well placed to support the development of social capital.


# Discussion:


##  Benefits of physical education and sport:

* Physical education: helps children to develop respect for the body—their own and others; contributes towards the integrated development of mind and body.
* Understanding of the role of aerobic and anaerobic physical activity in health; positively enhances self-confidence and self-esteem; and enhances social and cognitive development and academic achievement.
* Opportunities to meet and communicate with other people; to take different social roles; to learn particular social skills (such as tolerance and respect for others).
* To adjust to team/collective objectives (such as cooperation and cohesion); and that it provides experience of emotions that are not available in the rest of life.
* personality development and psychological well-being.
* Positive effects of physical activities on self-concept, self-esteem, anxiety, depression, tension and stress, self-confidence, energy, mood, efficiency and well-being’.


### Physical health:

* First, it could affect the causes of disease during childhood. Second, it could reduce the risk of chronic diseases in later life (Sallis & Owen, 1999). 
* Favourable relationship between physical activity and a host of factors affecting children’s physical health, including diabetes, blood pressure, the ability to use fat for energy and bone health.
* Number of ‘adult’ conditions, such as osteoporosis (brittle bones) and coronary heart disease, have their origins in childhood, and can be aided, in part, by regular physical activity in the early years.


### Cognitive and academic development:

* physical activity at school could enhance academic performance by increasing the flow of blood to the brain, enhancing arousal levels, changing hormonal secretion, mental alertness and improving self-esteem, but the empirical basis of such claims is varied and more systematic research is still required to adequately assess the validity 
* report of three longitudinal studies emphasises that ‘academic performance is maintained or even enhanced by an increase in a student’s level of habitual physical activity, despite a reduction in curriculum or free time for the study of academic material’.
* Difficult to distinguish between causation and correlation.


### Mental health:

* There is now fairly consistent evidence that regular activity can have a positive effect upon the psychological well-being of children and young people.
* Physical activity is positively associated with good mental health. The case is particularly strong with regards to children’s self-esteem, especially so in disadvantaged groups, such as those with learning difficulties or initially low self-esteem.
* Reduced stress, anxiety and depression.


### Crime reduction:

* The rehabilitation approach tends to be smaller scale, concentrating on offenders, and often involves intensive counselling to identify the needs of offenders in order to provide relevant programmes.
* Usually via outdoor adventure activities, or ‘demanding physical activity programmes’, aimed at developing personal and social skills and improving self-confidence, self-efficacy and locus of control, which it is hoped will transfer to the wider social context and reduce offending behaviour.
* There is the addition of the conceptual difficulty that crime reduction is indirect, working through a number of intermediate outcomes or processes, such as improved fitness, self-esteem, self-efficiency and locus of control and the development of social and personal skills. 
    *  So, it is not sufficient simply to measure outcomes and assume that these are ‘sports-effects’ 
* The ‘diversionary’ rationale increasingly underpins relatively large-scale sports programmes targeted at specific areas, or during specific time periods.
* Urban regeneration projects, largely aimed at reducing youth crime, by encouraging the positive use of leisure time and capitalising upong the supposed socio-psychological outcomes of participating in sport. 
* ‘information about outcomes was hard to come by’, and this seems to be partly due to difficulties inherent within the original rationales for many schemes, such as over-ambitious objectives, vague classifications of ‘anti-social behaviours’.
* One study in the USA reported parents’ perceptions that their children’s behaviour and attitudes had improved after participating in a community-based intervention programme (they mentioned improved interest in and achievement at school, willingness to help at home, communication ability and interaction with parents).
* increase in skill-competency, and a reduction in anti-social behaviour was reported following participation in a recreation programme in two housing projects.
*  problems of drug-taking and associated levels of criminal activity, which reported a 15% reduction in crime in the local beat area and a 43% reduction in juvenile crime.


### Reduction of truancy and disaffection:

* Some studies report generally positive outcomes in terms of pupil attendance following the introduction of sports-based schemes (Long et al., 2002), 
* and there is evidence from studies of those attending pupil referral units that an increase in the availability of sporting activities would make the school experience a more attractive option.
* On the theme of the relationship between school sport and attitudes to school, it ought to be acknowledged that not all pupils enjoy such activities, at least when presented in certain ways.
* It would be misleading to suggest that physical education and sport will necessarily contribute towards positive attitudes to school in all pupils, as inappropriate provision might actually increase disaffection and truancy.


## Social Inclusion and/or Exclusion in Sports and P.E. 

* **Social Exclusion:** what can happen when individuals or areas suffer from a combination of linked problems such as unemployment, poor skills, low incomes, poor housing, high crime environments, bad health and family breakdown’.
* Lack of access to power, knowledge, services, facilities, choice and opportunity.
* Social Exclusion Unit’s interpretation of exclusion, since it confuses symptoms with causes . Alternative definitions, such as-‘Social exclusion refers to the multiple and changing factors resulting in people being excluded from the normal exchanges, practices and rights of modern society’.

### Dimensions of Social Inclusion:

* spatial: social inclusion relates to proximity and the closing of social and economic distances; 
* relational: social inclusion is defined in terms of a sense of belonging and acceptance; functional: social inclusion relates to the enhancement of knowledge, skills and understanding; and 
* power: social inclusion assumes a change in the locus of control. 

Claims made on behalf of participation in sporting activities suggest that it has the potential to, at least, contribute to the process of inclusion by: bringing individuals from a variety of social and economic backgrounds together in a shared interest in activities that involve all of the above dimensions. 

Mediated by children and young people’s access and opportunity to participate in sporting activities.


### Barriers to resource (sports and p.e.) accessibility:

* Some children and young people within society seem to be relatively disadvantaged in terms of levels of sporting participation, and are also more generally at risk of exclusion.
* **Gender: **Young people between 6 and 16 years found that, in each age group, boys spent more time doing sport, took part in a greater number of activities and competed at a higher level than girls. 
    * all girls said they enjoyed sport, both in physical education lessons and in other settings, and yet they demonstrated relatively low participation rates.
    * boys are more likely to be attracted to competitive team games, whilst many girls prefer individual sports, like swimming, athletics and riding; a fact which is all the more noteworthy in light of the heavy emphasis placed on competitive team games in many schools.
* **Minority ethnic groups:** overall participation rates for adults in minority ethnic communities was 40%, compared to 46% for the adult population as a whole.
    * range of barriers to participation by minority ethnic communities, including lack of acceptance of the value of sport, fear of discrimination, absence of role models and inappropriate facilities and services.
* ‘the combination of gender and ethnicity have a much greater effect on general participation in some groups than others…To be female and Bangladeshi, Pakistani, African and Indian accentuates the difference in participation’.
* **Individual issues:** young people with a disability were far less likely to take part in extra-curricular or out-of-school sporting activities.
    *  a range of barriers to participation, including self-consciousness, low levels of confidence and, significantly for our interests, negative school experiences.


### Barriers within the curriculum:

* An additional problem is lack of suitably competent and confident teaching staff, associated with inadequate training time (especially for primary teachers) and reduced advisory and in-service support.
* Making participation voluntary and removing it from mainstream curriculum time presents a danger that the situation for children for whom opportunities for participation are already limited will worsen. 


##   Interventions to aid inclusion:

* First, access is a necessary condition of inclusion: if sport is to be involved in the process of social inclusion, it is essential that children and young people have opportunities to participate; without access, any discussion of social inclusion is moot.
* Second is the issue of agency: arguably, inclusion is not possible unless institutions allow it to be so, hence the importance of projects that involve excluded young people in decision-making (Long et al., 2002). 
* Third, a substantial body of evidence suggests that the development of basic physical competence, such as is developed through a quality physical education programme, has a powerful effect upon self-esteem, confidence and peer acceptance (Bailey, 2000a), which may be necessary conditions for social inclusion. 
* Finally, sports programmes seem to be most successful when they have effective, preferably local, leadership 

The formal listing of the inherent properties of sports and the supposed associated benefits overlooks the vitally important distinction between **necessary conditions **(i.e. participation in sport) and **sufficient conditions** (the conditions under which the potential outcomes are achieved).

**Areas of inclusion to be aware of:**

* Different individuals’ experiences of the same activity will be subject to wide variations, as will the effects. 
* effect is, presumably, even greater once young people step outside the school gates, and the effects of such influences as gender, class and ethnicity are more apparent.
* the nature of the teaching, coaching and supervision they receive. These will impact on the nature and extent of any effects that are evident. 
* The personal qualities and teaching styles of physical education teachers can be significant factors in the development of pupils’ perceptions of the subject.
* There is also some evidence pointing to the importance of sports leaders, especially in obtaining positive outcomes among young people at risk.
* Moreover, any effects will be determined by frequency and intensity of participation and the degree of adherence over time of the participants. 
* Implications for the development of technical and social skills and particular attitudes and values. 
* Finally, the voluntary nature of most extra-curricular sport may mean that such activities primarily attract those who are most susceptible to sport’s positive impacts, and those most in need of the experiences (either from a personal or community perspective) may be the less likely to participate. 


# Conclusion:
* the marginalisation of physical education as a curricular experience (Hardman & Marshall, 2001), and differentiated opportunities across populations of young people, there is an increasing, indeed urgent, need for rigorous evaluation of the outcomes of participation in physical education and sport.
* widespread failure to undertake systematic monitoring and evaluation of the outcomes of sport or physical activity-based projects.
* the question relates to the nature of the contribution such participation can make to a range of issues
