## Brief:
- Scope &amp; Description: The research study assessed the morbidity pattern of one hundred orphan children aged 10–16 years, and their knowledge about signs and symptoms of common childhood morbidities and treatment-seeking practices. Thorough clinical examination and anthropometric measurements were done. The findings suggested that awareness about diseases and their complications was low; and self-care was highly prevalent for most health problems.

# Common Issues found in Institutional care:

- Deprivation of parental care and, often, food, education, and medical care experienced by children. Studies often report that lack of parental care and denial of a secure family life, coupled with congested and often unhygienic living conditions, affect orphan children adversely.
- Research identifies the risks of orphanage care that may broadly be classified as:
  - Infectious morbidity,
  - Nutrition and growth,
  - Cognitive development,
  - Socio-affective development,
  - Physical and sexual abuse in the institution, all of which are more during infancy and early years of life.
- Poor utilisation of healthcare facilities:
  - Hospital care was sought for very few cases. This is of concern since most of the morbidities in children are accompanied by frequent complications, thereby increasing the morbidity burden further.
  - Treatment seeking practices were found to be unsatisfactory with predominance of self treatment or using drugs without prescription either from local RMPs or upon pharmacists' advice.
  - Orphanage staff may not be trained to identify development of danger signs which may pose grave risks to the children.
- Lack of proper certified and approved measurement tools. The uncertainty abounding in the efficiency of these organisations, especially in third world countries, have led researchers to devise proxy indicators for estimating efficiency and quality through assessment of health status, among other indicators, of the residents. Valid measures, required for planning promotional measures for the welfare of orphaned children, requires reliable data on their health and nutrition status. Such data was grossly deficient from different parts of the country, more so from South India.

## Common Infections:

- **Skin Infections:** Skin infections were reported most commonly followed by common cold and fever. A previous study done on orphans in the Southern state of Tamil Nadu similarly reported high prevalence of skin infections including pediculosis (25%) and oro-dental problems including dental caries (50%).
- **Eye Infections:** Infections of the eye were the lowest in prevalence. Similar prevalence of ear conditions was also reported. They however, also reported ophthalmic problems including Bitots spots which we did not find in our population.
- **Diarrheal disease and Respiratory Infections:** Some studies done on children residing in urban slums where prevalence of diarrheal disease and respiratory infections has been reported to be higher than our population

# Measurement tools used to assess morbidity profile: [[impact assessment]]

- The questionnaire was developed to yield demographic and morbidity-related information about the participants.
- Details related to the number of days a child was suffering from the present condition, number of episodes of illnesses in the past one year, number of times adequate treatment was offered, and place of treatment were collected.
- Anthropometric examination was conducted for each participant and recorded.
  - **Weight:** Weight was recorded to the nearest multiple of 10 grams using an electronic weighing balance, Tanita HD −318 digital weighing scales (Tanita Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Each participant was weighed with minimum clothing and without shoes, standing upright with arms hanging by the sides.
  - **Height** : Height was recorded to the nearest centimetre (cm) using a non-flexible fibreglass tape, Seca 206 mechanical measuring tape (Seca, GmBH and Co Kg, Hamburg, Germany). The respondent was asked to stand upright on a firm level ground, against a flat vertical surface without shoes.
  - **BMI calculation:** The body mass indices of the participants were calculated in kg/m2 based on the measured weight and height and were plotted on separate BMI charts for boys and girls
  - **Clinical assessment:** The condition of skin, eyes, hair, gums, nails and thyroid gland was observed for clinical assessment of nutritional deficiencies. Systemic examination for reported morbidities was conducted according to the hospital protocols of Mediciti Hospital.

# Possible reasons for the high incidence of morbidity:

- **Poor living conditions and utilisation of facilities:** The high prevalence of common morbidities reported in the present study as well as the inadequate treatment seeking practices of orphanage heads reflects the poor living conditions and inadequate knowledge of common diseases and their treatment. It also shows the poor utilisation of healthcare facilities, although all had access to a doctor.
- **Lack of Awareness** : Many diseases were found to be present due to lack of awareness about disease causation. Further, none of the children knew about the complications of most diseases under study, even when they were suffering from it.
  - Knowledge of signs and symptoms of common childhood morbidities was low among resident children, especially for fevers, skin infections/ infestations and ear conditions.
  - None of the children knew the common conditions presenting with fever (including malaria, dengue, typhoid and others).
  - None of the children had heard about scabies earlier, and none considered otitis media to be a dangerous condition. Only two children who had previous pneumonia knew about common symptoms of the disease, but not complications.
  - None of the children were aware that worm infestation could occur through faeco-oral route
- **Poor nutrition:** Poor nutritional status has been shown to be widely prevalent and directly associated with morbidities among institutionalised children. Further, the poor nutritional status of the children may have an impact on their cognition levels which may worsen their awareness and treatment seeking practices. Vaida et al reported the contrary by showing the majority of orphan children having normal nutritional status, with no clear relationship between orphan-hood and the nutritional status of children compared with those who lived with their parents.
- **Low immunity at younger age:** We also found the morbidities to be higher among younger age groups which may be explained by their lower immunity levels and young age as a risk factor for most diseases.
