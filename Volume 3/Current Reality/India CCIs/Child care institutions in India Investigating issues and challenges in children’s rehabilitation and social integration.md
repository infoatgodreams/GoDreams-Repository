## Importance of institution in preparing children for reintegration

- In a study carried out on Preparation for Young People Leaving Care: The Case of SOS Children ’ s Village, Ghana emphasized the caregiver ’ s relationship with the young people as a critical factor for preparing for social integration. 
	- The SOS mother was the most prevalent source of preparation for independent living skills training identified by young adults. 
	- The mother's training began early, was casual, and was learned through observation and practise. Young adults learned practical life skills, including cooking, washing, and shopping, while helping with family household chores.
	-  The mothers taught other skills such as; time management, financial management, healthy eating habits, and most female participants with details about sexual and reproductive health problems, usually about puberty. 
	- The youths are also provided with an opportunity to learn cultural skills and social values (Frimpong Manso, 2012 ). 

  
# Problems associated with alternative care systems:
## Family Restoration

- The problem with family restoration (for some children) is that the children are sent back to the same environment where they were abuse and neglected. 
- There are also children (abandoned, surrendered and orphan) who do not have family and are not adopted; in this case, the institutions find it difficult to restore them to a family environment. 
- Furthermore, instead of changing the child's behaviour and attitude, institutional care merely restores the child without adequate planning and preparation and pressurize the parents to take the child back (if the child has some attitude or behavioural problems). 
- Some parents who never visited their children Child does not receive moral and financial support 
- Parents without a sense of responsibility Not willing to take back the child 
- Children prefer to stay back - Some children refusing to be restored 

## Sponsorship

### What is sponsorship?
- Preventing institutionalizing and rehabilitating and social integrating through sponsorship Sponsorship is another method for rehabilitating and social integrating of children. 
- The programme helps in preventing a child from being institutionalized and restores the child to the family. 
- It is of two types preventive and rehabilitative. As the name suggests, the former prevents the children from being institutionalized and later rehabilitating and integrating children out of the institutions to the family (The Integrated Child Protection Scheme, 2014). 

### Problems with sponsorship
- The study shows that not a single child from the twenty childcare institutions uses the scheme to help children’s institutional recovery. Two children from one institution were chosen for sponsorship but were not funded (although the selection list was declared more than a year ago). 
- Parents tend to keep the children in institutional care rather than receive a mere two thousand rupees.
- There is no proper knowledge in the community as such people are unaware of the programmes. 
- Moreover, institutional care providers are also unaware of the programme 
- The delay in sanctioning money was another reason why the sponsorshop programme fails. 

## Foster Care
- Foster care as means for preparing children ’ s rehabilitation and social integration Like adoption, foster care is also one way for children to be rehabilitated and socially integrated. 
- Children still can be in a family environment; however, it is just temporary. It is one way of preparing for the adoption of children. 
- The child welfare committee makes the final decision for foster care after studying the family's intent, capacity, and experiences living with children. Foster parents are also responsible for the health, education, nutrition and well-being of children compared to adoption (The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, n.d.)

### Problems with foster care
- The study indicates that not a single child from the twenty child care institutions is placed in a foster care facility. 
- Surprisingly, some insti tutional cares are unaware of the policy and programme for keeping a child in foster care. 
- The institutional staffs that are aware of the programme are also confused with whom to approach and avail the services as it is not effective. Therefore, the staffs who prepare the individual care plan for each child do not select or recommend these methods for the rehabilitation and social integration of children because they do not function effectively.
- The caregiver also points out that people do not inquire about taking in children for foster care which is also one of the reasons for not keeping child in a foster care. This certainly violates children’s rights to foster care and with a family. 

## Problems with Adoption

### Rules and guidelines
- It is stated and also observed that the rules are rigid, the procedures are lengthy, and the state scenario is not always applicable. While it prohibits unlawful adoption of children, it is difficult for parents to adopt a child because parents must be physically, psychologically and financially stable without any criminal history. Concerning their income, health, etc., they have to organize and send various documents. 
- They have to register on the website as Prospective Adoptive Parents (PAPs) and wait for their chance. Besides, matching is also carried out by the Central Adoption Resource Agency (CARA) and not by the adoption agency concerned. 
- Parents cannot physically pick the children, and the child's preference is often an issue again when done online. If the prospective parents are pleased with the child, a home study will be performed by the Specialist Adoption Agency (SAA) of the respective state and recommended for adoption.
-  Otherwise, the process must again start with the parents waiting for their opportunity and CARA matching the parent – child. This slows the process of adop - tion, meaning children have to live in institutional care for longer. 
- The study also indicates that registered prospective parents waiting for their chance are so high compared to children who are adopted.

### Differently able or girl child usually left out. 
- The study also suggests that most prospective parents prefer a male boy, ideally be - tween 0 and 3 years of age. Children with different able or special needs are only adopted by foreigners and not within the state or country (which is also minimal).
- Therefore, children who are otherwise differ - ently able, older children and girls are generally left out. Surprisingly, in two institutions (specialized adoption agency), not a single child in the institutions nor any child was available for adoption.
