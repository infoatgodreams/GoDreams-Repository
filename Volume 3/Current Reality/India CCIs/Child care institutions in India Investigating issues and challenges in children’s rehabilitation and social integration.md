## Importance of institution in preparing children for reintegration

- In a study carried out on Preparation for Young People Leaving Care: The Case of SOS Children ’ s Village, Ghana emphasized the caregiver ’ s relationship with the young people as a critical factor for preparing for social integration. 
	- The SOS mother was the most prevalent source of preparation for independent living skills training identified by young adults. 
	- The mother's training began early, was casual, and was learned through observation and practise. Young adults learned practical life skills, including cooking, washing, and shopping, while helping with family household chores.
	-  The mothers taught other skills such as; time management, financial management, healthy eating habits, and most female participants with details about sexual and reproductive health problems, usually about puberty. 
	- The youths are also provided with an opportunity to learn cultural skills and social values (Frimpong Manso, 2012 ). 

  
# Problems associated with alternative care systems:
## Family Restoration

- The problem with family restoration (for some children) is that the children are sent back to the same environment where they were abuse and neglected. 
- There are also children (abandoned, surrendered and orphan) who do not have family and are not adopted; in this case, the institutions find it difficult to restore them to a family environment. 
- Furthermore, instead of changing the child's behaviour and attitude, institutional care merely restores the child without adequate planning and preparation and pressurize the parents to take the child back (if the child has some attitude or behavioural problems). 

## Sponsorship

### What is sponsorship?
- Preventing institutionalizing and rehabilitating and social integrating through sponsorship Sponsorship is another method for rehabilitating and social integrating of children. 
- The programme helps in preventing a child from being institutionalized and restores the child to the family. 
- It is of two types preventive and rehabilitative. As the name suggests, the former prevents the children from being institutionalized and later rehabilitating and integrating children out of the institutions to the family (The Integrated Child Protection Scheme, 2014). 

### Problems with sponsorship
- The study shows that not a single child from the twenty childcare institutions uses the scheme to help children’s institutional recovery. Two children from one institution were chosen for sponsorship but were not funded (although the selection list was declared more than a year ago). 
- Parents tend to keep the children in institutional care rather than receive a mere two thousand rupees. There is no proper knowledge in the community asSome parents who never visited their children Child does not receive moral and financial support 
- Parents without a sense of responsibility Not willing to take back the child Children prefer to stay back - Some children refusing to be restored - Irregularity in sanctioning funds Negative impact on the functioning of an institution Children are affected Staffs payment are irregular - Institutions borrowing money with interest Irregularity and untimely release of funds E.

## Problems with Adoption

### Rules and guidelines
- It is stated and also observed that the rules are rigid, the procedures are lengthy, and the state scenario is not always applicable. While it prohibits unlawful adoption of children, it is difficult for parents to adopt a child because parents must be physically, psychologically and financially stable without any criminal history. Concerning their income, health, etc., they have to organize and send various documents. 
- They have to register on the website as Prospective Adoptive Parents (PAPs) and wait for their chance. Besides, matching is also carried out by the Central Adoption Resource Agency (CARA) and not by the adoption agency concerned. 
- Parents cannot physically pick the children, and the child's preference is often an issue again when done online. If the prospective parents are pleased with the child, a home study will be performed by the Specialist Adoption Agency (SAA) of the respective state and recommended for adoption.
-  Otherwise, the process must again start with the parents waiting for their opportunity and CARA matching the parent – child. This slows the process of adop - tion, meaning children have to live in institutional care for longer. 
- The study also indicates that registered prospective parents waiting for their chance are so high compared to children who are adopted.

### Differently able or girl child usually left out. 
- The study also suggests that most prospective parents prefer a male boy, ideally be - tween 0 and 3 years of age. Children with different able or special needs are only adopted by foreigners and not within the state or country (which is also minimal).
- Therefore, children who are otherwise differ - ently able, older children and girls are generally left out. Surprisingly, in two institutions (specialized adoption agency), not a single child in the institutions nor any child was available for adoption. 

  
hat eight institutions do not arrange vocational training within chil - dren ’ s institutions or send them outside institutions. While the other eight institutions conducting vocational training are confined to em - broidery, tailoring, pickles making, art-making, basic computer class, and music lesson. The vocational training seems to be organized for the sake of reporting or documentation. The staff are not trained (the institution ’ s staff conduct it), do not have a degree, and no certificate is provided (which can help the children in the future). Moreover, it is conducted for a few weeks, and regardless of their interest, children are made to un - dergo the training. For life skill education, children are made to clean and prepare vegetables, making fire, fetch water, laundry, shopping and cooking. However, the institutional do not provide essential skills like decision making, creative thinking, and critical thinking, effective communica - tion, interpersonal relationship, self-awareness, problem-solving, per - sonal hygiene, money management, sex education to children. Moreover, sex education has been deemed inappropriate and need not be taught to children (especially to girls). 

  

institutional care are also not aware of the programme. The delay in sanctioning money was another reason why the sponsorship programme fails. 

  

ation The author does not cover all the issues and challenges instead confined to those deemed to be the most significant in planning, providing and preparing children for effective rehabilitation and social integration. 3.2.1. Poor physical infrastructure Child care institutions need to have separate rooms for different purposes: dormitory/bedroom, study room, sick room, counselling room, kitchen, storeroom, library, etc. (The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Model Rules, 2016, n.d.). However, the majority of institutional care does not meet the requirements laid down in the rules. Out of the thirteen child care institutions with fifty children ’ s ca - pacity, twelve institutions do not have separate dormitories that can accommodate twenty-five children each. While the rules speak of providing different rooms for twenty-five children, not a single institu - tion, however, fails to comply with these rules and even three in - stitutions have used one room as a study and dining room. While it is restricted to dictionaries, story books, maps, general information, etc., only three institutions have arranged libraries for children. Out of twenty institutions, only 

  

Lack of professional and trained staff Children in the child care institution have particular issues from different backgrounds. The children admitted to institutions are of various types; children who are abandoned and surrendered, survivor of exploitation, abuse and trafficking, minor marriage (elopement), runaway, children with incapacitated parents, etc. As such, institutional workers should not only be dedicated, hard-working, caring, and passionate about working with children. Nevertheless, they should also be preferred to be educated or qualified in counseling, child psychology, psychiatric, etc. or persons who have studied or graduated in social work, psychology, sociology, and other related subjects. The study, however, indicates that most workers were not professionally trained. The study found that most institutional care staffs are hired without understanding their expertise and experience working with children and childcare institutions. Moreover, some organizations have also employed their closed ones to fill the post. The practice profoundly influenced the social and emotional growth of the children as their issues remain unresolved. Staff incompetence may also be observed through documents, individual care plan, solving and managing children ’ s atti - tude and issues, etc. Only a few institutions employ staffs that have degrees in related to the child. The study also found that not a single institution arranged training for their respective staff in childcare, child protection, child develop - ment, file/register documentation and maintenance, and various acts and laws relating to child and childcare institutions. Staffs have attended training on Juvenile Justice (Care and Child Protection) Act, Child Protection from Sexual Offence. However, the study shows that training organized was emphasized in general, not in particular. For instance, the procedure on how to effectively administer home visits, social investi - gation report, how to efficiently execute reporting, prepared individual care plan, etc. are not discussed. Thus, in all these fields, the staffs typically faced challenges that generally affect children ’ s rehabilitation and social integration. 

  

rooms for counselling and guidance; only three institutions have separate rooms, and other thirteen institutions carried out the counselling in the office itself or the study room. Insufficient bathrooms, toilets and space for the playground can also be observed in most child care institutions. 

  

tutions uses the scheme to help children ’ s institutional recovery. Two children from one institution were chosen for sponsorship but were not funded (although the selection list was declared more than a year ago). Some of the reasons why sponsorship programmes fail are; parents tend to keep the children in institutional care rather than receive a mere two thousand rupees.
