# Failures in alternative care

- Alternative forms such as foster care still at nascent stage • Adoption rates are abysmally low – in 2014-2015, only 4,362 children were adopted (CARA 2014-2015) 
- Informal kinship care arrangements are widespread but not necessarily well documented and supported by the government
- Lack of community-based support/stigma and mindset issues
- Invisible and unspoken issues such as children with disabilities and their special care 

# Gatekeeping of children from institutional care  

- Preventing separation of children from families
- Political commitment and accountability in ACC
- Assessment and documentation of the child and family situation in a multi-sectoral context
- Engagement with and empowerment of family members and community
- Regular review and complaint mechanism, reunification with family, wherever possible,
- High quality, accessible, and affordable, services for all, targetted and specialised for those in need
- Child budgeting, measuring the costs and social return of well-being of children
- Supporting transition of children successfully
- Placing children in alternative care in the best way possible 
- Monitoring all children in alternative care. 

  
# Model Interventions

## ECHO Bangalore
- Community Strengthening Prevention and family support through community based rehabilitation (CBR) followed at ECHO Bangalore is another good example of gatekeeping. 
- Under this model, strategy is developed at the community level to provide equity to children and weaker sections of society by organizing community members and resources to provide sustainability (empowerment) through equal participation. 
- This builds the capacity of community members through tangible and intangible resources. The basic concept is focused in decentralization of responsibility and resources both human and financial at the community level through regular follow-up and assistance . 
	- The basic objectives of the CBR program are: 
		- To provide a home where the child gets, love, care, understanding and personal concern
		- Creating awareness among families in the community about better child care practices and to promote interest among families to secure education for their children.
		- Creating awareness in the community on the dangers of school dropouts, child labour, alcoholism, additions to substances, child marriages and trafficking
		- Prevention of children getting into malpractices and crimes by providing “non-formal education” to those, who dropped out of schools and re-admit them in the schools.
		- Helping girls to continue education through financial support and family counseling.
		- Personality development programs and talent enhancement programs to ensure the holistic development of children. • Evaluating healthy community attitudes to girl children. 


## Group Foster Home
- Group Foster Home (GFH) is one of the innovative program of the organization for the children who are about to complete the rehabilitation period. 
- The objective of the programme is de-institutionalization of the children and youth who are under institutional care.
-  It is the next step towards their independence and the organisation provides them with rented house facilities and assists them in job placements. 
- They manage the home and share the monthly expenses and participate in household chores as like in the regular home Youth are encouraged to undertake savings for a better future. The change in the children motivates them to remain back with their families or it may be vice versa either. 
- Through GFH, children get back to society as a dignified citizen. SOS Children’s Villages has a strong family strengthening program that help families stay together through material support, training, education, counseling and building parents’ capacities to care for their children. 
- Specifically targeted to the needs of each community and family, the program also offers nutritional and health care support for children and nursing mothers; children’s school fees, uniforms and materials; support to parents in establishing a steady income and stable home; training in paren ti ng skills and household management; learning about children’s rights; and family counselling. 
- Community members and decision-makers are involved and objective needs analyses are carried out to determine which families need help and what kinds of programmes will be most suitable. 

## Initiative by State Government of Rajasthan and Family Strengthening Services (FSS) 
- It is not only the NGOs in India that have developed strong FSS but we also have strong examples from the state governments also. Rajasthan is one State that stands out in this regard. 
- The Palanhar scheme 17 got started as a scheme to cover orphan children of Scheduled Caste in 2005 but today has been scaled up to cover
	-  orphan children of all caste and
	-  also covers children of parents serving life time imprisonment or death sentence,
	- children of widows
	- children of legally remarried widow
	- children of leprosy affected mother/father
	-  children of HIV/AIDS infected mother/father
	-  children whose mother has gone to Nata, 
	- 18 or children having mother/father with disability (40% or above), children of abandoned/divorced woman. 
- The scheme reduces the vulnerabilities of children by strengthening the family base care and ensuring social, economic and overall development of children by providing financial support. The annual income of the family to be eligible under this scheme is that they should not earn more than 1.20 lakhs and it is mandatory for children of age group 3 to 6 years to attend Aganwadi and 6 to 18 years to attend school. 
- The assistance provided under the scheme included Rs. 500 per month for a child (upto 6 years), Rs. 1000 per month for a child (age group 6 to 18 years) with an annual grant of Rs. 2000 per family. 

# Existing Alternate Care Systems
## Foster Care
- Foster Care, including Group Foster Care (GFC) 32 Foster care is a non-institutional family-based placement of a child, by the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) in the domestic environment of a family, other than the child’s biological family, for the purpose of alternate care. 
- Here the child lives with a non-biological family but with identical cultural, tribal and/or community. This form of care is meant for Children in Need of Care and Protection (CNCP). In India, the JJ Act 2015 prescribes foster care as a measure for rehabilitation and social reintegration of children in need of care and protection. 
- Section 44 of the Act deals with different aspects of foster care that include, inter alia, selection of foster family, monthly funding, responsibilities of foster family and inspection of foster families. 
- Rule 23 of the Model Rules, 2016 deals with various aspects of foster care like role of DCPU and CWC, preconditions to be confirmed by foster care families, criteria for selecting group foster care setting, duties of foster carers, and other procedural matters.
- ICPS also strongly advocates family-based care of children and deals with procedures for sanction and release of funds under foster care programme, foster care fund and foster care approval committee
### Types of Foster Care 
Foster care can be individual foster care or group foster care (GFC). GFC is a family-like care in a fit facility that provides personalized parental care in a family-like environment to a group of unrelated children in a community setting.
- Short Term Foster Care - For not more than one year. Two foster children can live in a foster family, unless in the case of siblings which may be more than two in order to keep siblings together
- Long Term Foster Care - Exceeding one year or more and until the child reaches the age of 18 years. Two foster children can live in a foster family; unless in the case of siblings which may be more than two in order to keep siblings together.

The District Child Protection Unit (DCPU) is the nodal authority for implementing the foster care programme in a district and the CWC has been given the power to take

## Processes involved in foster care

- All decisions related to placement of a child in foster care. The law also sets up a Sponsorship and Foster Care Approval Committee (SFCAC) to review and sanction sponsorship and foster care fund. 
- Financial support of not less than INR 2,000 per month per child is available to foster parents and group foster care if requested and dully approved by SFCAC. 
- If both the spouses are Indian citizens or both are willing to foster the same child and both are 35 years and more and in good health, they can foster a child. Normally this foster family should have enough income with to meet the needs of the child. 
- The foster parents are also obliged to follow rules laid down including regular visits to doctors, maintenance of child health and their records and also attend foster care orientation programs organized by the DCPU.
-  Not more than 4 children including their own children shall be placed in family foster care. 
- Siblings should preferably be placed together in a single family or same fit facility and where relevant and necessary, biological parents’ consent is required in foster care.
-  For GFC, the DCPU is responsible to identify Fit facility for GFC and register the organisation under the Act. The CWC has to recognize the organisation as a fit facility for placement of children in GFC. 
- The organisation has to be also registered on the NITI Aayog website, it should have a child protection policy in place and have updated files of all medical reports of its caregivers. 
- The accommodation should be sufficiently spacious for a group of eight children to reside and ensure privacy of children and the caregivers should not have any criminal conviction or indictment in the past.
-  The law also stipulates that the GFC home should have the look and feel of a house providing a family environment, rather than an institutional setting and be located within an existing neighborhood to encourage local interaction and the organisation should be ready to attend pre service training provided by DCPU.
-  It should have provident fund and retirement policy for caregivers; 


## Role of DCPU in Foster Care
- The DCPU or an NGO or social worker identified by DCPU must
- Visit foster families least once a week for the first month
- Visit monthly for next six months
- Visit bi-annually after 7 months
- Create and maintain Individual Case Files for each child in foster care
- Monthly visits to schools to ensure his education continues for a period of 1 year Adoption Adoption is the process of transferring a child from biological parents or CCIs to adoptive parents through law. Under the JJ Act, 2015 adoption is defined as a “process through which the adopted child is permanently separated from his biological parents and becomes the lawful child of his adoptive parents with all the rights, privileges and responsibilities that are attached to a biological child”. This is a key reintegration measure for CNCP as it provides the children family-based non-institutional childcare. Once adopted legally, the child enjoys all the benefits from those family ties from the date of the adoption.

The Fundamental principles governing adoption: 33 • The child’s best interests shall be of paramount consideration, while processing any adoption placement; • Preference shall be given to place the child in adoption with Indian citizens and with due regard to the principle of placement of the child in his own socio-cultural environment, as far as possible; • All adoptions shall be registered on Child Adoption Resource Information and Guidance System and the confidentiality of the same shall be maintained by the Authority.

There have been a number of intimates taken by the GOI in the recent times to increase the low rates of adoption. These include an online adoption process, simplified and transparent procedure in adoption process and referral based system. Greater transparency has been achieved with introduction of CARINGS. Despite this, the challenges remain as follows: • Less children reaching adoption agencies. • Less number of children available in proportion to large number of registered waiting parents. • Informal and illegal adoptions. • Delays at various level in the adoption process The roadmap for CARA is to ensure 100% hassle-free adoption process with the help of online system and reach all adoptable children deprived of family care through. • Capacity building and sensitization activities • Promotional activities • Helpdesk and counseling centre 

  

Sponsorship Sponsorship is providing of additional financial support to families who are unable to meet educational and other needs of their children, due to a number of reasons. The assistance is towards meeting expenditures on medical, nutritional and educational and other needs of the child, allowing the child to continue and stay with their biological families. Working with the family as a unit is a very effective approach in sponsorship. Eventually, families are trained to become self reliant and independent through long-term rehabilitation plans that is self-sustainable. NIAC reflects the shift in childcare from the “Welfare” to the “Developmental” and from the “Needs” to the “Rights” and from “Institutional Care” to “Non-Institutional Alternative Care”. A collective and co-ordinated approach that focused on family and community based care for children and youth is a step in the right direction of child protection.
