# Educational Outcomes for Orphaned and Abandoned Children.



* India has a growing proportion of orphan and abandoned children (OAC) due to factors such as human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), poverty, and illness of parents. There are more than 25 million OAC in India.
* an Orphan is a child who has lost one or both parents. An abandoned child is defined as one who does not live with either his/her mother or father (UNICEF 2014a, b). OAC are often victims of emotional, physical, mental, and sexual abuse (Goldman and Anastasi 2003). In addition, they are exposed to risks such as poverty, stigma, discrimination, and unequal opportunity.
* An important part of a child’s well-being is determined by the socioeconomic conditions in which they are born, grow, and live (UNICEF 2012).
* Studies examining the increasing burden of caregivers of orphan and vulnerable children (OVC) impacted by HIV/ AIDS suggest that biological relationship of the child with the caregiver also affects the well-being of the OVC.
*  this disadvantage is mostly due to the additional burden that the households face as a result of their low socioeconomic status (Nkamleu and Keilland 2006).
*  attempt to explore the importance of biological relationship with the caregiver and its impact on educational outcomes of OAC,
* Children or adolescent’s participation in work that does not impact their health and development or interfere with their schooling is generally regarded as something positive. Child labor, on the other hand, is defined as work that deprives children of their childhood and is harmful to their physical and mental health.


## Characteristics of the Caregiver:



* Caregivers are the direct source of social and financial capital that ensures proper development of a child (Scott et al. 2013). 
* They are also the means to transmit policies and programs in the larger ecosystem in order to support children in attaining their rights. 
* Many studies have suggested that caregiver health and education are the most influential factors that impact a child’s educational outcome
* Caregivers with higher levels of education are more likely to support school enrollment and retain children in school, despite monetary constraints
* caregivers that have access to proper shelter, health care, food, and other basic assets have greater ability to provide good quality care to their children, thereby, improving the child’s education and health outcomes.
* Along with low-socioeconomic status, certain social and cultural factors further reduce the capability of caregivers, including gender, caste, religion, land distribution, and geographical location (Tsujita 2013).


## Characteristics of the Child:
* Certain child characteristics also impact educational outcomes. These include age, gender, and health of the children.
* In India, female children continue to be one of the most disadvantaged groups that are systematically left out of school due to fiscal constraints, safety, and perceived economic returns, among other reasons.
* male children in low-income families, as compared to male children in higher-income families, are more likely to be involved in work as compared to being enrolled in school. 
* although more barriers exist for female children for school enrollment, their educational achievement tends to be higher as compared to boys
* Age: While there has been an increase in primary school enrollment, UNICEF reports indicate that the secondary school enrollment rates in India still remain dismal.
* India faces a high dropout rate when children are transitioning from primary school to higher levels of education.
* a high proportion of students (15.9 %) drop out of school in grade 5 in India


## Role of Biological Relationship between Caregiver and Child:



* The caregiver’s investment in the child’s education is based on the interplay of child, caregiver, and household characteristics
* caregivers of HIV/AIDSaffected orphans in Sub-Saharan Africa face a heavy burden of financially supporting the orphans in addition to providing for their own families. 
* In such circumstances, children that are not biologically related to the caregiver might face additional disadvantages as compared to those children that are biologically related.
* children who live in households that are headed by non-biologically related caregivers’ fare systematically worse than those living with biological parents.
* participation in educational activities by orphans residing in resource-constrained households is considered a luxury. 
* These children are often involved in paid or unpaid work and are deprived of educational opportunities due to disadvantages arising from the interaction between limited resources and relationship with the caregiver. 


## Theoretical Framework:



* utilizes the capability approach (CA; Sen 1985) as an organizing framework to explore the association between caregiver characteristics and educational outcomes of OAC.
* narrow definitions of well-being as restricted either to utility, liberty, commodity, or primary goods
* well-being should be conceptualized as people’s capabilities to function or the presence of effective opportunities to undertake the activities in which they want to engage.
*  re-emphasizes the right of an individual to have certain opportunities that would ensure their well-being and full development.
* Nussbaum adds a set of central human capabilities, such as bodily integrity, affiliation, and practical reasoning, among others.
* advocates for these basic capabilities to be embodied in the constitution and to be guaranteed to all. 
* utilize only specific aspects of “asset,” “capability,” and Bfunctioning^ as defined by Sen to explore the impact that caregiver and child characteristics have on education outcomes of OAC in India.
* core characteristic of an asset is its ability to enable functioning. Assets should not be limited to material goods and services alone
* emphasizes caregiver and child characteristics as assets that enable or restrict the functioning of individuals.
* study recognizes the impact of biological relationship with caregiver in resource-constrained communities as an asset.
* Children’s involvement in excessive work, whether paid or unpaid, might constrain opportunities to attend school, to have leisure time for play, as well as other important activities needed to achieve overall well-being
* Assets and capabilities impact the functioning of an individual. Functioning is described as real achievements that make life valuable and would further contribute to expand other capabilities
* education as one of the imperative functioning’s of children.
* This study, therefore, uses the CA framework to explore the impact of caregiver and child characteristics, specifically biological relationship when moderated by child involvement in work on OAC educational outcomes, which is defined as functioning.


## Methodology:


### Study Description:



* Positive Outcomes for Orphans (POFO) study used a two-stage sampling survey method in six sites in five countries to identify a sample of 1,480 children in 309 community-based settings.
* OAC in a community-based setting was defined as a single or double orphan, or a child abandoned by both parents, who was living in a family situation instead of an institution or on the streets 
* It is a longitudinal cross-cultural research study, which is designed to identify and understand characteristics of caregiving across various care structures and cultures, and its relationship with positive child outcomes


### Measures:



* The outcome variable was measured by educational status of the child. 
* This variable is a combination of items current school attendance and target grade.
*  School attendance was measured by asking the caregiver the question Is (Orphaned Child) currently attending school?
* Target grade was measured by calculating the difference between the current grade of the child and the target grade the child should be in based on his/her age the child was enrolled in school. 
* the outcome variable was dichotomized to include ‘currently attending’ and ‘at or above target grade’ and ‘currently attending below target.’
* target grade as a measure of education outcome not only provides information on individual level outcomes such as knowledge and learning capabilities but also gives an insight into system level issues such as quality of services and teaching at schools and national level school performances.
* Assets: These were measured by identifying caregiver and child characteristics. Caregiver characteristics included health, education, marital status, age, gender, and biological relationship to the child. 
* Child characteristics included general health, gender, orphan status, and age. Child general health was measured using one item from the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form.
* Opportunity: This was measured by child’s involvement in work, which combined involvement in work outside the home and housework. ‘During the past week, did (Orphaned Child) do any kind of work for someone who is not a member of this household?’


### Data Analysis Procedure:



* Hierarchical logistic regression has been selected as the method of analysis, as the independent variables (IVs) were entered cumulatively in an order that was decided by the authors.
* The first model consisted of assets measured by caregiver and child characteristics as predictors of educational outcomes. 
* The second model included the caregiver and child characteristics as well as the asset variable caregiver–child relationship and the opportunity variable child involvement in work. 
* In the final model, moderation effect of child involvement in work on the biological relationship with caregiver and educational outcomes of OAC was tested 


## Results:


### Characteristics of Sample:


#### Child Characteristics:



* The sample was restricted to OAC and their caregivers in two POFO study sites within India. 
* The age of the children ranged from 6 to 12.9 years. The mean age of the children at the baseline was 9 years
* Fortynine percent of the OACs were paternal orphans, 13 % were maternal orphans, 7 % were double orphans, and 32 % had living parents who were not residing with them. 
* Sixty-eight percent of OACs were the biological child of their primary caregiver, 
* while 31 % were not biological children of their primary caregivers.
* The majority of the children reported good health. Almost half of the sample was involved in some kind of work, which included domestic or non-domestic work.


#### Caregiver Characteristics:



* Majority of the caregivers were female (81 %). 
* Most of the caregivers were between the ages of 18 and 50 years, with a mean age of 38 years (standard deviation, 11.3 years). 
* Fifty percent of caregivers were widowed, 35 % were married, and approximately, 15 % were single, divorced, or never married.


## Discussion:



* The study results indicate that more than half of the OAC sample in the study was below their target grade level. 
* Child education outcomes were significantly associated with caregiver’s health and education. This finding supports previous studies that indicate caregiver education and health are protective factors for children at risk.
* Educated parents are more likely to understand the value of their children being educated and its long-term positive effects, irrespective of their socioeconomic status.
* if the caregiver is in poor health, he/she is less likely to be working and providing for the children.
*  children with ailing caregivers are more likely to drop out of school, and spend most of their time nursing the caregiver, or providing for the household.
* Study results specified that with an increase in age, children are less likely to be in the target grade.
* A situational analysis of education in India by USAID (2014) indicated that although primary school enrollment is high, the dropout rate for both boys and girls increases manifold when transitioning to higher-level classes. 
* boys become more labor force Bready^ and are directed towards paid labor.
* girls, the reasons for dropping out might include marriage, caretaking of younger siblings or ailing parents, and reservation of resources, among others.
* Interestingly, child’s gender was not a significant predictor of education outcome.
* This suggests that although child’s gender might be an important predictor of education outcomes, for this particular sample, other factors might be more influential.
* children who are orphans or are not residing with their parents tend to fare worse than child that reside with their parents.
* The interaction results indicated that children who were not biologically related to their caregivers and were involved in some kind of work, either household or paid work, were less likely to be in the target grade as compared to children who were biologically related to their caregiver and were involved in some kind of work.
* results suggest that when caregivers have limited resources, their caretaking abilities are compromised, as they make choices about who to provide for and which household members have more value.
* orphans in households with non-biological caregivers might be more engaged in paid work to generate additional income, or be involved in household chores to reserve resources rather than utilizing it for education related expenses.
* The study uses baseline cross sectional data, and therefore, does not help to understand patterns of change and development overtime.
*  Secondly, since caregivers report the data, the authenticity of the reports for child level information cannot be validated. 
* Thirdly, as ‘involvement in work’ included both paid and unpaid work, we cannot differentiate between the types of work in which the OAC were involved.


## Implications:



* while kinship or informal care is the most common form of care within the country, there are few agencies in place to monitor the services.
* Initiatives should be taken to formalize kinship care and to increase awareness about the rights available to caregivers under the current laws and policies.
* To inform current policies, national-level data should be collected to track the exact number of OAC in India.
* help understand the magnitude of the issue and direct community, national, and international attention towards protecting the rights of these children and contribute to vigorous research. 
* To strengthen the capacity of the primary caregivers, initiatives should be taken to gather information regarding barriers faced and support required by them.
* Community resource mobilization and support is imperative to share the responsibility of providing guardianship to OAC. 
* The national and local government and non-government agencies should make efforts to mobilize community resources and work towards strengthening community solidarity, 
* schools should recognize the additional risks that are faced by OAC. As of 2010, India guarantees every child between the ages 6 and 14 years, the Right to Free and Compulsory Education 
*  OAC rights are often neglected. Steps should be taken to accommodate the special needs of the children and provide better quality of education to them. 
* Measures that could be taken include: improving school infrastructure, quality of teachers, within school health check-ups, mid-day meals, provision of evening schools, and support and respite programs for caregivers.
