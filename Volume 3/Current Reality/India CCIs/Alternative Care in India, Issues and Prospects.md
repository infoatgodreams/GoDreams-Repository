## Brief:
- Scope & Description: The research study assessed the morbidity pattern of one hundred orphan children aged 10–16 years, and their knowledge about signs and symptoms of common childhood morbidities and treatment-seeking practices. Thorough clinical examination and anthropometric measurements were done. The findings suggested that awareness about diseases and their complications was low; and self-care was highly prevalent for most health problems.

Family Strengthening and Non-Institutional Alternative Care Approach This puts family and family-based care at the centre and advocates the same for children in need of care and protection. The approach aims at preserving and strengthening families where children are at risk of separation.  

  

Models/Approaches to Child Protection Systems Approach A systems approach to child protection necessitates a substantial abstract move from the conventional impartial programming focus on particular groups of children in need of protection, to the achievement of more sustainable, inclusive and enduring responses to child protection issues. The main aim of the systems approach is to strengthen the protective nature of the environment around children and to strengthen children themselves, in order to ensure their well-being and fulfil their rights to protection from abuse, neglect, exploitation and other forms of violence. These key players include government, civil society, parents, caregivers, families and other June 2019 Alternative Care in India: Issues and Prospects 8 community structures which together provide formal and informal child protection mechanisms and services

Alternative Care Alternative care is understood to be care for orphans and vulnerable children lacking the custody of their biological families and parents. It includes adoption, foster care, guardianship, kinship care, and other community-based provisions for children in need of care. One of the critical conditions when employing alternative care for children is forecasting the duration and permanency of placements that guarantee constancy, stability and a sense of belongingness. 

  

Community-based Care 

  

The UN Guidelines for the Alternative Care for Children 2009 underline the significance of family in a child’s life and providing them care in residential settings preferably in their own communities .  This allows children to maintain ties with their innate support networks including neighbours, friends and relatives. This will minimise disruption to their social, cultural and educational life. It also increases the possibility of the reintegration of the children into their families and culture. 

  

 In countries where child care and protection systems are not well developed, community-based mechanisms can be significant in supporting children in need of care by providing informal alternative care provisions.

 Kinship and guardianship are the most prevalent forms of community-based care in India. However, legislation has recently been introduced regarding the formal provisions for community-based alternative care for children. Discussed below are the major forms of this care. 

  

uardianship A guardian is a lawfully appointed adult representative for a child. The guardian’s role is to make sure that a child’s rights are upheld, and the child’s best interests are protected. The modalities of being a guardian may vary from region to region. Where formal guardian systems do not exist, alternative systems of care may be created by having a legally documented representative for the child. 

  

The laws governing guardianship of children in India include the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, and The Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956. 

  

Adoption Adoption is defined as the permanent placement of a child in a family, whereby the rights and responsibilities of the biological parents are legally transferred to the adoptive parent/s. 

  

The laws governing the adoption of children in India are the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, the Hague Convention on Inter-Country Adoption, 1993 (Ratified by the Government of India in 2003), the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, and the Adoption Regulations, 2017. 

  

Foster Care Foster care is the temporary placement of a child with a family when their biological parents are unable to care for them. Foster care is formal care typically provided by unrelated adult/s. This arrangement is for a specific time until the child can be reintegrated and reunified with their biological family. Hence placement in foster care is not permanent in nature. Foster carers generally receive assistance to meet the child’s needs which may include

raining, guidance and financial assistance from the government. Foster care can be advantageous and may play an important role in a situation where a child’s own family demonstrated a temporary inability to care for the child. The laws governing foster care in India are the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, and the Model Guidelines for Foster Care, 2016. 

  

Kinship Kinship care is full time care of a child by a relative or member of the extended family (Bromfield and Osborn, 2007). This is an arrangement which is the most common form of alternative care worldwide. It is characteristically managed without formal legal intervention. In numerous developing nations, kinship is fundamentally the only form of alternative care available (UNICEF, 2006). It offers many advantages over other forms of care since it permits family relationships to continue, keeps the children within their culture and community, and avoids the anxieties associated with the placement of children with unfamiliar adults and families.

However, there are socio-cultural barriers that create resistance to upholding formal alternative care in India. • Apathy: The dislike of change creates a resistance to accepting a person (child) of a different ethnic group. Since India is a large and diverse country, the population is also diverse. Families often show resistance to accepting an unrelated child from a different background. Religion, region, caste, colour, and language of the child often become the reasons for non-acceptance by prospective foster families. In an ideal situation it is required that foster parents should respect the religious practices and beliefs of the birthparents, even though the child is in foster care. Religious beliefs of people are rigid since practices vary vastly, hence it is challenging to place a child with a family which has different religious practices. • Fear of separation and emotional vulnerability:  Indian culture gives priority to emotions and believes in developing relationships with significant others. Families in India also fear developing an emotional bond and attachment to the foster child and this creates resistance to fostering a child. • Too much emphasis on permanent placement i.e. adoption:  Other forms/options (short term arrangements of care for the children) of alternative care are neglected by the child protection professionals since adoption has been accorded priority due to its permanent nature. Additionally, adoption as a care placement of the children has gained recognition among the general public. The prospective families want to have parental rights over the child they provide care for so they do not want to invest in a child without having parental rights. The families prefer to have a child permanently placed with them. • Corruption:  As recently quoted by the CEO of  the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA, India), foster care has been misused/ exploited by people as certain unethical practices have crept in. • Lack of awareness:  Since the understanding and awareness of foster care and other non-institutional care options for children has not fully evolved in India, the gap between policy and practice remains. This has caused the foster care programme to become a backdoor entry into adoption or an entry point for misuse. • Preference for a younger child : One of the issues that the foster care system in India is facing is that families want a younger child. Younger children are Rajagiri Journal of Social Development Seema Naaz and Zubair Meenai 15 preferred since they easily adjust to the family and it is easy to train the child to fit into their family. Not only in cases of adoption, but even families who had chosen foster care had expressed the desire for a young child. The process of placing older children who could not be put up for adoption in foster care is impractical since older children are not wanted. • Ambiguous policies and guidelines:  The policies and guidelines for alternative care in India are either not in place or ambiguous. There is a need for advocacy and involvement of various stakeholders to develop effective policies and guidelines. The government and concerned departments need to take a proactive move to put the systems in place. • Lack of trained staff:  The functionaries are neither familiar with the laws and regulations nor are they well trained to deal with the issues of child protection vis-a-vis alternative care. Capacity building programmes for the functionaries working with the children need to be designed and delivered. Additionally, they should be sensitised and trained in monitoring and follow up concerns. • Lack of funds to support the children and caregivers:  The budgetary allocations to family-based alternative care provisions are meagre and are not sufficient for the requirements of the children in need of care and protection. Where funds are allocated, they are being under utilised or not utilised at all. • Large numbers of the children in need of care and protection:  Since India is a huge country, the number of children in need of care and protection is also large. Hence it is a long and tiring process which takes a lot of effort and consistently hard work to develop a pool of prospective families willing to provide short term residential care for such children.
