# Key Highlights


- Budget for Children (BfC) share is the lowest share in the last 11 years i.e **2.35% vs 2.46% last year. **

- In absolute terms, the allocation is **INR 92,736 Crore** (Union Budget 2022-23) against **INR 85,712.56 Crore** (Union Budget 2021-22).

- In terms of the sectoral share, **Child Health, Education and Development** continues to receive reduced allocation in the Union Budget 2022-23 while the share of **Child Protection** has seen a marginal increase of **0.01 %** (i.e 0.04% vs 0.03% last year)

 # Child Protection Deep Dive

- Children protection has been **one of the least prioritized sectors** in terms of resource allocation over the years.
	- In 2022-23, child protection has received **only 0.04 per cent** of the total Union Budget
	- In absolute terms this is **INR 1,583.82 Crores** which is a 44.7% increase but in the context of the rising child protection needs due to the pandemic, this is insufficient.
	- In order to understand the **inadequateness of child protection
     allocations**, it will be pertinent to take a look at the allocations towards some of the flagship schemes in the previous years’ budget.
		 - For example, in the 2019-20 Union Budget, the total allocation for the Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS) was **INR 1500 Crore.** 
		-  As we moved ahead, the total allocation forthe overall child protection sector is a little more than INR1500 Crore. The question that arises at this point is if the allocation made in the Union Budget 2022- 23 is sufficient to meet  the growing needs of the child protection sector.

-   The ChildLine India Foundation reported an **increase in child
    > marriages** by more than 33% and August alone an increase of more
    > than 88%.

-   Reports from other states such as Jharkhand suggest that the
    > **number of children trafficked increased by over 600 %** in April
    > and May, 2020 during the Covid-19 lockdown, when compared to the
    > same two months in 2019.

-   **Kidnapping and Abduction** of children has the highest number of
    > cases - **54,785** cases.

-   It is now an admitted fact that **child labour has seen an upward
    > trend** during the COVID times as there are enough evidences to
    > show that many children had to drop out from school to support
    > their families. The ILO and UNICEF report warns that globally, **9
    > million additional children are at risk** of being pushed into
    > child labour by the end of 2022 as a result of the pandemic. A
    > simulation model shows **this number could rise to 46 million** if
    > they don’t have access to critical social protection coverage.

-   According to UNICEF India, more than **1.5 billion children in India
    > missed out their schooling** due to COVID-19 restrictions. This
    > has compelled children to work to support their families. And yet
    > there is a **massive reduction of 75 per cent** towards the
    > **National Child Labour Programme** in the Union Budget 2022-23,
    > which cannot be justified.
