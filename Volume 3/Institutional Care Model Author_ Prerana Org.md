**About Prerana:**  For over three decades now Prerana has been working in the midst of the red-light areas with the actual and potential victims of CSE&T. By 1996 we started actively intervening in the domain of Post Rescue Operations. The intervention became intense and started yielding success stories thereby consolidating our self-conﬁdence and faith in positive transformation. In 1999 the idea of setting up an anti-trafﬁcking resource centre started taking shape and was soon launched with the help of the US Government. An ofﬁcer from the US Government, Mr. Mark Taylor encouraged us to set up the ATC. Over the last two decades the ATC has proved its utility and made substantial contributions to the anti-trafﬁcking cause.

**1.1. Institutionalization**

**1.2. Child Care Institutions: **Section 2(21) of the JJA defines a ‘child care institution’ as a children’s home, open shelter, observation home, special home, place of safety, specialized adoption agency and a fit facility recognized under the Act for providing care and protection to children, who are in need of such care services. 

**1.3 Institutionalization as a Measure of last Resort**

The life of a child living in a CCI is very different from their life in the family. Thus, the JJA mandates that a child shall only be placed in institutional care as the last resort based on social inquiry.

**1.4. Needs Identified in the Institutional Model**


        ● Shelter


        ● Health


        ● Development


        ● Social Protection/Welfare Schemes


        ● Legal


        ● Social Integration



* **SHELTER**


### **2.1. Safety**


    **2.1.1. Social and Legal Status:** The care provided to the child victim must be trauma-informed and sensitive so that they are not re- victimized. The JJA states that a CH must be set up in every district for the placement of a CNCP. Usually, the Superintendent or the person in-charge of the CH (if the CH has been registered previously) coordinates with the State and District authorities about document submissions and maintains regular follow-ups. The State Government may, at times, grant a provisional registration within one month of receiving the application. This provisional registration may be valid for a maximum period of six months. In cases where the provisional registration is not received, the CCI can use the proof of receipt of the application as a provisional registration to run an institution for a maximum period of six months. The State Government may, at times, grant a provisional registration within one month of receiving the application. However, even during this period, it is advisable to communicate with the District WCD Office regularly to check the status of the application. It is also advisable that the CCI informs CWC of all the children residing in the CH. No admissions or discharges from the CCI should be done without their Order.


    **Prerana Practices: **The organization has actively practiced, developed, and disseminated protocols on the minimum standards of care and protection for children in institutions. Some of the activities undertaken by Prerana are:



* **Refining tools of inquiry:** Prerana helps competent authorities like the CWC take informed, evidence-based decisions on whether a child victim requires institutional care or is ready to be restored with their family. Prerana has also developed and refined tools of inquiry such as the Social Investigation Report (SIR) that is now a critical component of an inquiry process as per the JJA, 2015. Prerana has also developed and refined tools of inquiry such as the Social Investigation Report (SIR) that is now a critical component of an inquiry process as per the JJA, 2015.
* **Assessing a child victim’s social environment:** In cases of child victims of CSE&T, Prerana assesses the dangers in a child's physical and socio-cultural environment. If vulnerabilities exist, the organization advocates for temporary institutional care and protection without undermining the need to strengthen family-based support systems for an early restoration.
*  **Clarifying concepts:** Prerana advocates for deinstitutionalization as a goal of institutional care. The ultimate goal of institutional care is to help child victims rehabilitate and reintegrate into society.


### **2.2. Protection**

**2.2.1. Minimum Standards of Care and Protection**

A provision to this Section also empowers the Central Government to frame Model Rules until such


    time as the State Government publishes its own Rules. One objective of the Rules is to ensure that the CH in which a child victim is placed is fit and equipped to provide comprehensive care and protection. Following are certain criteria that have been laid down by the Model Rules (to be adopted by State Government to form their own Rules) to ensure that the children receive due care and protection:

Following are certain criteria that have been laid down by the Model Rules (to be adopted by State	Government to form their own Rules) to ensure that the children receive due care and protection:

RULE 26: Details of personnel managing and monitoring the institution

RULE 29: The criteria for physical infrastructure for accommodation in the institution

RULE 30: The minimum standards for clothing, bedding, toiletries and other articles in the institution

RULE 31: The facilities in the institution for maintaining sanitation and hygiene

RULE 39: Setting up of Management Committees in an institution for its management and

monitoring the progress of the children

RULE 41:Inspection of an institution by the Inspection Committees set up by the State Government

RULE 61: Duties of the Person-in-Charge

RULE 62: Duties of the Case Worker

RULE 63:Duties of the House Mother

RULE 67: Security measures

RULE 74 (9):Search of visitors

**Prerana Practices**

Prerana’s best practices for running a CH have evolved through years of efforts to attain and

maintain certain minimum standards of care and protection in its CH, Naunihal. Some of these are

detailed and administrative in nature but extremely essential for the effective day-to-day functioning

of a CH.



* **Conducting safety rounds in the CH**: The ‘on-duty’ staff is assigned the responsibility of making safety rounds at least twice a day—once in the morning and once at night before locking the facility.  During the day, the staff is expected to make regular rounds of the facility.
* **Conducting an internal safety audit: **The Superintendent is expected to conduct an internal safety audit every month.This includes ensuring that the locks are in working condition, checking whether the security staff is provided with a uniform, baton, torch light, and other amenities, and assessing the facility for dangerous objects like a broken glass or a live wire.
* **Conducting an external safety audit: **Twice a year, the team from Naunihal facilitated an external safety audit. The team conducting this audit is composed of staff members and the resident girls of Naunihal. To ensure transparency and accountability it also includes members from a different Prerana project. The objective is to gather information and discuss various aspects that are responsible for the safety of a child, evaluate risks and assist the team in finding solutions to mitigate the risks. A report is prepared after the visit and shared with the Naunihal team. The team at Naunihal is then expected to submit a response to the report addressing concerns, if any, and communicating the interventions planned along with timelines to resolve the concerns.
* **Organizing daily morning debriefs:** There is a briefing session every morning to discuss the day’s schedule in the CH. The duties are discussed and delegated amongst the staff members that include but are not limited to escorting children to and from schools, tuitions and other vocational training programs, looking after their medical, first-aid, food and nutrition needs, developing care plans with the children, and undertaking follow-up visits.
* **Organizing capacity building programs:** Prerana advocates for and has developed the art and science of the minimum standards of care and support systems required in institutional settings. Prerana also conducts capacity building programs on the same for institutional authorities, duty bearers, caregivers, service providers and other stakeholders.
* **Maintaining a standard staff-to-child ratio:** As per the organizational policy, Prerana’s residential facilities have a child-to-staff ratio of 10:1 to provide better care and access to rehabilitative developmental opportunities.
* **Assigning the staff duty roaster: **Staff duties are assigned on a monthly basis, including night rounds and weekly offs for the staff members. This system is managed by the Superintendent of the Home and is reviewed on a weekly basis. At any given point in time, a minimum number of staff are available on residential duty at the Home.
* **Conducting a background verification of staff members appointed for residential care at CH:** A police background check is mandated for those appointed as residential staff members at Prerana. Lately, all those associated with any care services for children are required to conduct a police verification and submit the same to the organisation.
* **Allocating and distributing cases:** The cases of children referred to the CCI are distributed amidst the staff members.The staff is responsible for interacting with the child regularly, helping them adapt to the institution, discussing their rehabilitation, and preparing and executing care plans.
* **Conducting induction orientation for every child:** Every child receives an Induction Orientation upon entry into the CH. This includes helping them understand why they are being admitted into a CCI, their rights in a CCI, services offered, orientation to different staff members and their roles. This is also followed by giving them a basic welcome kit with a pair of clothes and necessary daily essentials without them having to wait in anticipation or ask. This is an effort for the child to get a feeling that the CCI is a place which cares for them.
* **Orienting visitors about Naunihal’s Child Protection Policy:** Every visitor who comes to Naunihal is given a brief orientation on the care that they need to take while they are in Naunihal to ensure that they don’t violate the child’s right to dignity and privacy. Those interacting with the children at Naunihal for a consistent time period as volunteers or interns are also expected to sign the Child Protection Policy and abide by the Rules stated in the Policy.

    **2.2.2. Access to open society**


   	It is important to ensure that the closed setting of the institution does not become the child’s only

way of life. Even while living in an institution, the child’s contact with the outside world should not be

suspended permanently. Every child should have access to society on a case-to-case basis. The

interactions of the child must be supervised by the case worker or staff members in the CH. One of


    the common ways of ensuring this regular contact is by helping the child access educational and vocational opportunities outside the institution.

The Maharashtra State JJ Rules has the following provisions to ensure the same:


    RULE 38(1): Provision of educational opportunities, both inside and outside the premises, as per the age and ability of the victim.


    RULE 39(1): Provision of vocational training, both inside and outside the premises, as per the age, aptitude, interest and ability.


    RULE 39(3): When a victim attends vocational training outside the premises of the institution, the victim shall be escorted with proper security planning and services.


    RULE 40: Options for recreational facilities may include indoor and outdoor games, picnics and outings, etc.

**Prerana Practices**



* **Ensuring access to educational opportunities outside Naunihal:** Once a child is admitted in Naunihal, the Staff at the CH undertake an educational assessment. The staff members escort the children to and from the school. The residents may be escorted by staff members or they may travel by themselves in smaller groups, especially those who are enrolled in college.
* **Ensuring access to vocational training programs: **In consultation with various civil society organizations and other local groups, opportunities for vocational training are discussed with the resident girls at the CH.Based on their interests, aspirations and skills, the residents attend vocational training programs at centers outside the institution and are either escorted by the staff members or travel by themselves in smaller groups.
* **Organizing recreational visits:** Exposure visits are organized in consultation with children once every six months.
* **Organizing recreational visits:** Exposure visits are organized in consultation with children once every six months. The children are accompanied by the staff members to science exhibitions, museums, libraries, day treks and cultural programs. Naunihal also organizes two or three outdoor residential camps in a year. Recreational activities such as visits to parks and movie theatres are also organized fortnightly.
* **Organizing other visits:** The Naunihal team obtains ‘Miscellaneous Orders’ from the CWC which permit children to step out of Naunihal (always accompanied with a staff) for various legitimate purposes. These include visits to the beauty parlor, purchasing clothes or the tailor for stitching or alteration of clothes and purchasing other essential supplies.
* **Organizing safety protocol meetings:** This is not a one-time task and is often repeated during individual casework interaction between the child and the case worker. The child is acquainted with emergency helpline numbers and how to use the public transport system. This also helps them learn age-appropriate independent living skills.For more details on the measures adopted for safety protocol, the ‘Safety Guidelines for Resident Girls of Naunihal’’ can be referred to.
* **Organizing visits by volunteers at the CH**: Approved/ vetted volunteers are encouraged to interact with the residents of the CH.
* **Participating in local cultural events and functions:** Residential societies and other local well-wishers often invite the Naunihal team including the girls for various cultural events organized by them in their localities.

**2.2.3. Adult Supervision**


    It is important for the child to be surrounded by trained and sensitive adult caregivers who can help them in establishing and maintaining a daily routine.

Rule 28(6) of the State Rules mandates police verification for every person appointed to work in a

CCI. Further, Rule 28(7) suggests a staffing pattern that may be used for a CCI to provide quality

care by qualified individuals who have been trained to do so.

Following are certain positions that are a part of the staffing pattern:



1. Person-in-charge for the residence known as the Superintendent
2. Probation Officer, Child Welfare Officer or Case workers (NGOs)
3. Counsellor, psychologist, or mental health expert
4. House Mother/House Father (residential and non-residential)
5. Part-time Educator/Tutor
6. Medical Officer (on call)
7. Para-medical staff (residential)
8. Part-time art and craft activity teacher
9. Physical Training (PT) instructor-cum-yoga trainer
10. Cook
11. Helper
12. Housekeeping personnel (residential)
13. Security personnel (shift-wise)

    **Staff training and capacity building**


**Prerana Practices**

The team ensures round-the-clock competent adult supervision.



* **Organizing regular training programs for the staff team: **Training programs on developing Individual Care Plans, conducting Social Investigations and documenting Reports, Gender Sensitization and sensitive communication with children, understanding JJA and POCSO are organized to improve the team’s understanding of laws and procedures
* **Monitoring the progress of the child:** Case workers routinely observe the child and make a note of any change in eating habits, stress-levels, concentration in studies, and participation in activities. If a positive change is observed, the child is appreciated for the same. If stress-related behaviors are observed, the child may be referred to the counselor after due internal discussions.
* **Documenting detailed guidelines and SOPs: **Prerana has put together a document titled ‘Safety Guidelines for Resident Girls of Naunihal’’ which is used to make the resident girls aware of safety protocols for their protection.
* Another document, ‘Working with Children Sensitively,’ is based on observations and field experiences of counselors and caregivers working with children in institutional settings.** #readinglist**

    Over the years, Prerana has also developed protocols on specific practices within CH such as Rules for sensitively checking the personal lockers for children at CH.

* **Planning the duties of the team**: Every month, the Superintendent, with assistance from the management, prepares a duty roster for the staff members. The duties are reviewed on a weekly basis. The standard child-to-staff ratio is maintained while developing the monthly staff roasters. Staff appointments and leaves are also sanctioned accordingly.
* **Conducting regular case work sessions with the child:** Within Naunihal, every child is primarily referred to one case worker who actively follows up with the child and coordinates with the CWC. The case worker also meets the child for weekly sessions to discuss any challenges or concerns they may be facing at the CCI.
* **Family strengthening interventions:** With the objective of restoration and long- term social reintegration of a child, the Naunihal team facilitates regular meetings of the parents with their children residing at Naunihal. This is done with due consultation and after securing relevant permissions from the CWC. This is done with due consultation and after securing relevant permissions from the CWC. The caseworkers may also conduct some visits to the child’s residence pre-restoration to prepare the family, if needed. In certain cases, in consultation with the CWC, a child may be returned home for a trial period to understand how they can adapt and adjust to their life back home.
* **Handling disclosures appropriately:** The team is equipped in handling disclosures or additions to previous disclosures (especially in cases of sexual violence) sensitively and providing the necessary support to the child.

    **Challenges Faced**


    Some of the risks that CCIs face in terms of access to a safe and secure environment for children are:

* **Registration with the State government:** As per the JJ Act, 2015, all CCIs, whether run by the government or CSO are mandated to register with the State. The process of this registration is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and often requires extensive follow- up. Sometimes, the staff in a CH may not be equipped to go through the rigorous process of online registration. Besides, the time and energy of the staff gets diverted in attending to such procedures and completing the formalities while the core function of engaging with the children takes a backseat.
* **Understaffing and transfers:** Human resource shortage is a huge challenge in implementing core functions at CCIs, especially those run by the State. Eg. A staff member may not always be available to escort the child outside of the institution. Even within the CH, multiple posts are often vacant due to shortage of applicants, lack of qualified and trained candidates, and professional burnout amongst the current staff. Routine transfers affect continuity of care provided to the residents. The expectations of the State in terms of the appointment of human resources is also not in line with the field realities. The Rules state the appointment of a part-time arts and craft teacher, a

 yoga instructor. Such individuals may be difficult to locate in a remote set-up.



* **Inadequate sensitization amongst the staff:** There may be shortage of funds or personnel to conduct adequate sensitization training, stress management, and self-care training programs for the different stakeholders involved. As a result, the quality of care provided to the residents of the CH suffers. For government-run CCIs, the salaries of the staff are also often delayed due to the gaps in the funding structure.
* **HEALTH**

3.1. Nutrition

3.1.1. Regular Nutrition

**Prerana Practices**



* **Creating a daily menu for the children**: A menu for four (breakfast, lunch, light snack and dinner) meals in a day is prepared in consultation with the cooks and the children. This menu is discussed and reviewed once every two months during the general monthly meetings with the children. 
* **Setting up a Nutrition Committee: **The JJA mandates creation of Children’s Committees at the CH.A Nutrition Committee is set up to ensure that children get together to eat their meals on time, oversee the wastage of food items, and look out for favoritism or discrimination in the preparation and serving of the meals.
* **Involving children in menu planning and in kitchen activities**: When individual donors donate food items to CCIs, the children’s inputs are considered while coordinating food options. The resident children, above 14 years of age are encouraged to observe and if they are comfortable, to participate in the kitchen activities as well as to provide the necessary feedback on food practices to the staff members. This also helps in facilitating independent living skills amongst children living in CCIs.
* **Tasting of food before being served to the children:** Once the meal has been prepared, a Staff member undertakes a tasting of the entire meal in modest quantities to ensure safety of the food being served to the children. The Staff also maintains a register for comments and feedback on the taste and quality of the food which is to be filled after the initial tasting. These comments are discussed with the cooks and among the staff on a regular basis.

3.1.2. Special Nutrition


    Maharashtra State JJ Rules specify an extra diet for nourishment like milk, eggs, sugar, and fruits on the advice of the doctor in the CH in addition to the regular diet, to gain weight or for other health reasons.

**Prerana Practices**

Prerana ensures that a separate menu is created for children with specific nutritional needs as

advised by the doctor.

3.2. Hygiene

3.2.1. External Hygiene

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Rule 33: Maharashtra State JJ Rules</span>


    **PREMISES: **All floors must be swept and washed every day.


    **MEDICAL ROOM:** The medical center must be clean and hygienic. The sick room or isolation room must be fumigated after every discharge, especially in the case of a contagious or infectious disease.


    **FOOD HYGIENE:** Washing vegetables and fruits before use. The kitchen slabs, floor, utensils and stove must be cleaned after every meal.


    **WATER HYGIENE:** Clean water must be available for drinking, bathing, and washing. A separate space must be provided for washing and drying. The CH must also ensure proper storage, cleaning, and maintenance of water storage systems.


    **WASTE: **Toilets must be well-lit, airy and cleaned with disinfectants twice every day. Regular


    **HYGIENE:** maintenance of the drainage and garbage disposal systems must be ensured.


    **PESTS RELATED:** Protection from mosquitoes, pests and rodents, especially in the storeroom where food and other supplies are maintained.

The responsibility of ensuring that these practices are duly followed in the CH is assigned to the

Child Welfare Officer or Case worker, House Mother or House Father, Person-in- charge or


    Superintendent. The Child Welfare Officer and Case worker have been assigned the duty of verifying the daily cleaning in the premises twice a day. These practices can also be reviewed by the Home Management Committee.

**Prerana Practices**

In addition to the Maharashtra State JJ Rules, Prerana practices the following to maintain hygiene standards:



* **Delegating responsibilities within the team:** While the primary responsibility of keeping the premise of the CH clean lies with the members of the staff at Naunihal, the resident girls are encouraged to take part in such activities voluntarily. Those residents interested in participating in the cleaning activities are paired with either an older resident or a staff member to undertake cleaning activities. This is an effort to build on their independent living skills.
* **Cleaning water storage facilities:** Water storage tanks are thoroughly cleaned twice a year by engaging external professional cleaning services.
* **Cleaning water storage facilities**: Water storage tanks are thoroughly cleaned twice a year by engaging external professional cleaning services. Similarly, plumbing and water seepage repairs are done minimally twice a year and as per the need of the Home.
* **Involving residents in healthy environmental practices:** Naunihal staff members along with the children started a kitchen garden with support from a local voluntary organization.
* **Setting up Children’s Committees:** As per Rule 42 of the Maharashtra State JJ Rules, every CCI should facilitate the setting up of Children’s Committees for different age groups of children to participate in the functioning of the CCI. In Naunihal, besides other committees a Cleanliness Committee is formed which consists of representatives from the residents who are responsible to oversee the cleanliness of the premise.

3.2.2. Personal Hygiene


    Children referred to CCIs as victims, rescued from sex trafficking often belong to marginalized communities and their personal hygienic practices may be influenced by their impoverished background and customs. Thus, when they are referred to CCIs, it is essential that the staff members engage with them on essential practices like regular brushing of teeth, handwashing, bathing, washing of clothes, regular clipping of nails, treating lice infestation, maintaining menstrual hygiene & disposal of sanitary waste products, and keeping the bed clean.


    **Prerana Practices**



* Conducting sessions with children about personal hygiene: Informative video sessions and discussions on personal hygiene management are arranged for the residents. Revising personal hygiene practices during casework and counseling sessions: Case workers observe the daily routine of the child such as brushing, bathing, cleaning, and cutting nails and discuss observations about such practices with them during their case work sessions.
* Assisting young girls with their hygiene needs: Young girls are accompanied to a nearby beauty parlor every month for body hair removal to inculcate the practice of keeping one’s body clean.The children are also taken for a regular haircut once in three months to a nearby beauty salon.
* Regular provision of personal hygiene products: Personal hygiene products like soap, hair shampoo, hair oil, sanitary pads, etc. are regularly distributed amongst the residents.

3.3. Physical Health

3.3.1. Medical Care

  	The staffing includes an on-call doctor and a residential paramedical staff or a nurse. Some of the	important provisions under Rule 36 of Maharashtra State JJ Rules are:



* Each child should go t**hrough a basic medical examination** by the Medical Officer within 24 hours of their admission at the CCI and within 24 hours in case the child is to be transferred to another CCI.
* The CCI should maintain a medical record for each child.
* Quarterly medical checkups including dental checkup, eye-testing, screening for malnutrition and skin problems should be facilitated by the CCI.
* Children with any special medical needs should be referred to a hospital.
* **Tests for pregnancy or diseases for victims of sexual offence**s are to be conducted with the Order of the CWC or the Children’s Court (where applicable). A psychosocial background of every child should be maintained by the CCI and updated as a part of the ICP. Medical needs including deficiencies should also be included in the ICP.
* **Appointing a General Physician (GP): **A General Physician (GP) visits Naunihal every month for periodic medical check-ups over and above the required provision of him being available to visit on call.
* **Setting up a medical room: **Naunihal has a Medical Room where the doctor examines the children. There is also a Recovery Room, if a child needs to be isolated to treat an infectious disease.
* **Maintaining a First-Aid Kit**: In-house provisions are made through a fully functional first aid kit to address basic health complaints like headache, indigestion, etc.
* **Conducting regular medical camps for residents:** A health camp is conducted in Naunihal twice a year which includes ear-nose-throat, dental, blood tests, gynecological examination, immunization (if applicable) and deworming treatments. A tetanus injection as well as lice treatment is administered once a year.

3.4. Mental Health

**Prerana Practices**


    Some children are referred to counselors by the case workers while others may directly approach the counselor themselves. The counselor and the staff members try to maintain a non- threatening and non-judgmental conduct, providing the necessary safe space to the children to share their thoughts and feelings. As per the Maharashtra State JJ Rules,** a counseling room is set up** for individual therapy and it is stocked up with stationery, art supplies, and other resources as directed by the counselor. External assistance from practicing psychiatrists is also sought.

**3.5. Challenges Faced While Addressing This Need**



* **Budgetary constraints: **Lack of proper budget disbursement systems and delay in securing the funds can strain the CH staff. For instance, delay in obtaining budgets for medications can severely limit the CH’s access to provide children with the right treatment. Sometimes, prescribed medicines may not be available at the government hospitals near the CH.
* **Understaffing:** Due to the low staff-to-child ratio and high vacancy in positions, it is challenging to follow-up with each child on their personal hygiene habits.
* **Lack of sensitivity towards the child’s health concerns:** The principle of confidentiality is not upheld in the highest regard when addressing a child’s health concerns. In the past, staff of government hospitals have been insensitive towards victims of sexual exploitation. Some CH staff members may also lack the awareness about mental health and disorders, may not be equipped to deal with children who have been through traumatic experiences which may end up in re-victimizing the resident.
* **Lack of medical facilities for CCIs located remotely:** Location of the CCIs is crucial in determining the access to services for their residents.


## **DEVELOPMENT**

4.1. Implementation of the Individual Care Plan (ICP)

The ICP details the child’s age- and gender-specific needs, and case history, prepared in consultation with the child, in order to restore the child’s self-esteem, dignity and self-worth and nurture them into a responsible citizen. The ICP is reviewed regularly as the needs of the child evolve. This document is also monitored by the CWC and the Home Management Committee. The JJA also requires the case worker to prepare a progress report on effectiveness or inadequacy of the ICP with appropriate reasons.

**Prerana Practices**



* **Conducting regular meetings: **When a child is admitted in the CCI, case workers start the process of developing the care plan within the first fortnight. By the first month, a basic draft of the care plan is developed in consultation with the child as well as other stakeholders such as teachers, medical professionals, counselors, etc. Subsequently, case workers meet with the child once a month to review the ICP.
* **Assisting the child to find the right opportunities for their skills and interests:** The varied interests of the children such as dancing, drawing, jewelry-making, and karate are incorporated in the ICP. Efforts are made to find appropriate service providers who would be willing to provide such opportunities to the children.
* **Coordinating with different stakeholders**: Other stakeholders involved in the implementation of the ICP include a counselor, doctor, educational and vocational service provider. case workers coordinate with these stakeholders and seek periodic updates on the child’s progress from them.
* **Submitting the report to the authorities:** Case orkers assess a child’s progress and update the CWC through regular follow-up reports. These care plans are also presented and discussed in the Home Management Committee meetings and feedback is sought from those present.

4.2. Education

4.2.1 Functional literacy programs

Even if a child has never been a part of the formal education system, identifying numbers and the alphabet is an essential skill to help them buy groceries, manage finances, and use public transportation, among other things. The level of literacy required for an individual for effective day-to- day functioning of such activities can be referred to as functional literacy.

**Prerana Practices**



* **Conducting educational assessments:** Case workers conduct an educational assessment to test the child’s reading and arithmetic ability using the ASER tool before enrolling them in a formal educational program. It helps them understand the level of education of the child based on their age and last educational qualification.
* **Facilitating in-house learning programs:** Efforts are made to enroll the child in a formal educational institution.However, in cases where the child’s interests are not aligned, they are enrolled in an in-house basic literacy program, as per their needs. However, in cases where the child’s interests are not aligned, they are enrolled in an in-house basic literacy program, as per their needs. Regular assessments are conducted to track the progress of the child.
* **Assigning older residents as mentors: **Older resident girls assist others with basic literacy lessons. This social interaction also helps residents develop healthy interpersonal relationships and learn from one another.

4.2.2. Access to Formal Education and retention in the Education System

The Maharashtra State JJ Rules include the provision of a range of educational opportunities including mainstream-inclusive schools, special schools, bridge-school, open-schooling, and non-formal education and learning. The Rules also specify the assessment of learning disorders in children, if any, and access to special education accordingly. The child is also given the opportunity to apply for scholarships and sponsorships, wherever applicable.


    **Prerana Practices**



* **Educating children about the available options:** Case workers orient the children with the educational options available as per their needs and abilities, and in the language in which the child feels the most comfortable.
* **Coordinating with CWC**: Case workers discuss a child’s educational options with the CWC and obtain the relevant Orders, in case the child has to travel in the vicinity (beyond Naunihal) to pursue education.
* **Orienting and promoting the child’s safety while accessing educational opportunities**: Case workers ensure that the children are safely dropped and picked up from school if they leave Naunihal. For older children, case workers conduct discussions on personal safety while travelling alone or using public transportation.
* **Facilitating in-house learning and Open Learning Programs**: In Naunihal, the children are provided in-house tuition or support classes as additional assistance to help them learn better. In case a child is not interested or comfortable in pursuing their formal education through a regular school, they are encouraged and supported to pursue their education through the National Institute of Open Schooling and eventually encourage them to appear for 10 thstandard Board examination NIOS.
* **Organizing career counseling: **Throughout their time at the CH, children are motivated to continue their education and also plan for their future. Thus, various career counseling sessions are organised in Naunihal through diverse professionals to orient the children on the various career options and the educational journey associated with each of the careers.
* **Collaborating with mentorship and sponsorship programs**: Naunihal connects the children with professionals after due diligence and vetting in specific fields or careers so they can receive one-on-one guidance and mentorship. Naunihal also links the children with educational sponsorship opportunities or other organizations for financial support to enable the children to pursue higher education.

4.3. Skill Development for Future Employability

4.3.1. Access to Vocational Training

**Prerana Practices**



* **Facilitating learning of basic computer skills:** At Naunihal, every child is encouraged and provided with an opportunity to learn basic computer skills. The importance of such skills for future employment is emphasized. Children who want to pursue an advanced course are also linked to service providers.
* **Facilitating learning of spoken English**: The importance of learning English is discussed with children. Spoken English classes are conducted regularly within the CH and staff members are also encouraged to communicate with each other as well as with the children in English.
* **Training in soft skills**: In Naunihal, small groups of girls are encouraged to attend in house soft skill training, which covers skills like interpersonal (people) skills, communication and listening skills, time management and empathy among others.
* **Facilitating training in other vocational skills:** Training in skills such as jewelry-making, fitness-training, mehendi (henna art), beauty care etc. is facilitated after discussing the options and with the residents and understanding their interests.
* **Involving children in the decision-making process:** Case workers conduct one-on-one and group discussions about the importance of vocational skills with the children.In the past, children have been provided with training on tally accounting software, Photoshop software for editing photographs, beauty care, and hospitality management. After consulting the child and the CWC, family members are also informed about the child’s desire and interest in a particular profession.

4.4. Life Skills

4.4.1. Independent Living Skills

They are loosely grouped into three broad categories of skills: cognitive skills for analyzing and using information, personal skills for developing personal agency and managing oneself, and interpersonal skills for communicating and interacting effectively with others.  These skills include learning basic financial skills, negotiating and purchasing, cooking, traveling independently using public and private transport, personal care, crisis management, and general awareness about society and global issues.


    **Prerana Practices**



* **Simulating “Flat Deputation”: **This is the system of allotting a resident girl who is over the age of 16 years, the opportunity to live independently within Naunihal to prepare her for the near future post-exit. This intervention involves a group of 4 to 5 children to move to a ‘flat’ (a self-contained apartment) for 3 to 4 days in a month that is located within the Naunihal building and equipped with facilities. This enables them to learn the skills required for independent living. Resident girls learn how to deal with a budget, buy their groceries, cook, clean, and share space.
*  **Conducting regular capacity building sessions with the residents:** Case workers discuss important topics such as healthy cooking, basic financial skills like savings and banking, and cultivating habits like reading the newspaper and knowing one’s civic responsibilities. Other important topics like rights of an individual with regards to the police, and information on prevention of child sexual maltreatment and sexual harassment at the workplace are also discussed with the girls on a regular basis…
* **Inculcating independent living skills in the daily schedule of the residents**: The residents at Naunihal are regularly involved in the day-to-day functioning of the CCI. This includes observing the activities in the kitchen, participating in cooking and managing the kitchen and food hygiene, keeping the CCI and its surroundings clean, managing budgets while living with others during flat deputation, traveling in groups and accessing public transport. Case workers also discuss these skills with the individual residents during their individual casework meetings.

4.6. Challenges Faced While Addressing This Need



* **Location of the CH**: The location of a CH may limit a child’s access to vocational training or formal educational institutions outside the CH.
* **Budgetary constraints: **Lack of funds may discourage a CH from enrolling the children in vocational training programs outside the institution. Another challenge is understaffing. A low staff-to-child ratio makes it harder to escort the children outside the CH to attend school, college, or vocational training classes.
* **Limited skills of the staff members: **Sometimes, the staff in the CH may have limited skills, training, and understanding required to prepare an ICP, network and provide necessary linkages, etc. In fact, the ICP is often not created with inputs from the child, despite being legally mandated. This may also hold the child back from establishing a rapport with the staff of the CCI.
*  **Low motivation of the child**: Sometimes, it can be hard to motivate and encourage children to continue education and retain them in formal or vocational educational institutions.
*  **Unavailability of the child’s documents:** In cases where children are rescued from sex trafficking, it may be hard to obtain the right documentation to enroll them in formal education.


## **SOCIAL PROTECTION AND WELFARE**

5.1. Social Protection Documents


    **Prerana Practices**

Documents like Birth Certificate or School Leaving Certificate of the child, and other identity

documents of the family are taken into consideration while making this assessment. If certain

documents are missing or there are discrepancies with regards to age, name or address, it is

brought to the notice of the CWC and efforts are made to rectify the errors on the documents.



* **Verifying the documentation of the child:**. Prerana runs a check on the name and birth date of the child to see if they are uniform across all the documents shared by the parents or guardians. If there is any discrepancy, case workers approach the competent redressal authority to rectify the errors. They also help the child and their family with other documents such as the Aadhar Card, PAN Card, etc. In the past, case workers have also assisted ex-residents for any documentary assistance even if they had turned 18 years old or had been restored to the family.
* **Setting up a bank account:** If the child does not have a bank account in their name, case workers help in starting up a bank account.
* ** Procuring other relevant documents (Birth Certificate, School Leaving Certificate) of the child**: In case the child hails from another district or state, the case worker in consultation with the CWC approaches child protection authorities of the respectiv…
* **Coordinating and procuring an Aadhar Card: **Aadhar is an essential identity document for the citizens of India.
* **Coordinating with the Child and relevant authorities for Orphan Certificate:** If the child is an Orphan (as defined under the JJA), the case workers in consultation with the CWC and DCPU help the child (in some case care leavers, 18+) to submit relevant documentation and follow up on the process of securing an Orphan Certificate. This Certificate may be helpful for the child in accessing educational and job opportunities as well as access other such State schemes for Orphans.

5.2. Challenges Faced While Addressing This Need



* **Lack of clarity on document issuance:** Some documents that establish personal identity often serve as a gateway to other documents of establishing eligibility. Some documents that establish personal identity often serve as a gateway to other documents of establishing eligibility. When the former is missing, it becomes impossible to create the latter. There is little clarity about which authority is competent to issue what documents. The fact that there are innumerable children without any document whatsoever, has not received any attention of the state and hence there is no solution in sight.
* **Navigating bureaucracy:** Individuals applying for identity or eligibility documents often experience great delay in receiving these documents from the issuing authorities. There is also the need to consistently follow up on such matters, which may not be possible for the CCIs that do not have the necessary resources to do so.
* **Challenges in communicating with families, especially if the child does not belong to the same district: **Sometimes, when children do not belong to the district where they are found, presented before the CWC and placed in an institution, it may be difficult to trace the child’s family back in their home district. At times, families may not be willing to share required information or hold back relevant identity and personal documents. The process of building trust with the family may also be long and time consuming.


## **LEGAL**

The socio-legal need of children is two-fold. Firstly, a child rescued from commercial sexual exploitation and trafficking is a CNCP under the JJA 18and has the right to rehabilitation under the law. Secondly, under other criminal laws, there is an ongoing effort to get the offender punished for the offense of trafficking a child for commercial sexual exploitation.

Along with providing a child victim with relevant rehabilitation services, making victim- witness protection services available to the child is also essential and enforceable by law. This section addresses two broad sub-needs: prosecution, the process in which a victim participates as the witness of the State to the crime; and care and protection, where the victim is offered the necessary rehabilitative services for eventual social reintegration.

6.1. Prosecution

In the Indian criminal justice system, heinous crimes of serious nature such as trafficking of persons for sexual exploitation are also treated as crimes against the State and not just against an individual. The State leads the prosecution of such cases, and the trial process is aided by oral evidence of the witnesses who could prove or disprove the commission or non-commission of an act punishable under law. The entire process of investigation and trial can be overwhelming for a child and there is a high chance that the child gets re-victimized and forced to revisit the details of the traumatizing incident.

6.1.1. Legal Orientation for the Victim (and Family, if applicable)

Given the sensitive nature of child sexual offenses and the traumatized mental state of the child victim, the POCSOA, 2012 has mandated child-friendly victim assistance that is in the best interest of the child. The amended POCSOA Rules, 2020, provide for the appointment of a ‘Support Person’ to assist the child throughout the process of investigation and trial. 19,20The role of the support person includes explaining to the child and the family about the child’s role as a witness, the procedural steps involved in a criminal prosecution, status of investigation of the crime, information on arrest and bail of the accused, status of appeal and the verdict of the trial.

**Prerana Practices**

The organization ensures that the child and their family receive orientation—if the family is not involved in the exploitation—about the procedures of trial and prosecution during the regular social case work sessions. Case workers also keep the child updated on the progress of the case, including age-appropriate expectation setting.

During the initial stage, case workers also engage with the child and the family to assess if there is a need to seek external pro-bono legal assistance. Accordingly, the case worker may approach a relevant service provider (lawyers empaneled with District Legal Services Authority – DLSA, other private sector pro-bono advocates), who would then help the Public Prosecutor (of the State) in the process of trial in the Court.

6.1.2. Victim Assistance Provided During the Investigation Stage

The child victim’s assistance is required for the following procedures:



* **Spot Identification (Panchanama):** Spot Identification refers to the visit made to the place of crime, or an attempt to locate the scene of crime by the Investigating Officer based on the information (or, the lack thereof) provided by the child victim. When the Investigating Officer draws a Spot Panchnama in the presence of two independent witnesses, it constitutes a Spot Identification.
* **Test Identification Parade**: As per Section 54A 21of CrPC, the suspect of a crime is exhibited along with a group of people with similar height, weight, build, etc. and the victim is asked to identify the suspect. These procedures may lead to recollection of traumatic incidents from the child’s past and thus require hand-holding and assistance.

**Prerana Practices**



* **Orienting and training the team with the process of investigation**: Prerana equips its staff members with a thorough understanding of the investigation process through regular training programs (both internal and external training programs).
* **Maintaining contact with the police**: The police is the key functionary in the process of investigation and prosecution.
* **Ensuring that child-friendly practices are followed:** Prerana ensures that all child- friendly practices mandated by the law are enforced by the relevant law enforcement officers when interacting with the victim to prevent re-victimization.
* **Documenting and disseminating best practices evolved nationally and internationally**
* Prerana has published a document that emphasizes the victim-witness protection process, enumerating the provisions of the law along with the practices followed by the organization during their on-ground intervention. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Best Practice Guide for Case Workers providing assistance in legal and court proceedings to a child rescued from sex trafficking - in the best interest of the child. #readinglist</span>
* **Keeping the child (and if appropriate, the family) in the loop of all processes**: Case workers orient the child on the criminal justice system age-appropriately.

6.1.3. Victim Assistance Provided During the Stage of Trial

Once the investigation process ends, the police submit a final report, known as a charge sheet. It contains details of the complete investigation made by the police, the charges or the relevant punishable sections that are being invoked against the accused, the evidence collected by the police during investigation in the form of recorded statements, list of witnesses and seizures, and other documentary evidence. The Investigating Officer submits the documents in the court as per the procedure, and it is the responsibility of the Public Prosecutor to represent the State. The Public Prosecutor opens the case and presents the facts based on the final report. Once the presiding Judicial Officer of the Court peruses the evidence presented before it, the charges on which the trial will be conducted are framed by the Court. 

The victim plays an important role in the next stage of trial, known as the stage of evidence. 24The victim-witness may be summoned to the Court to present the oral testimony to corroborate relevant facts.

The victim-witness may be summoned to the Court to present the oral testimony to corroborate relevant facts. Generally, the victim is a prosecution witness and is subjected to cross-examination by the defense counsel. In cases of children rescued from sex trafficking, it may not be easy for the child to narrate the traumatizing incident resulting from their exploitation. Visits to the court may also be intimidating for the child due to the non-familiarity of the environment. They may not understand the language of the advocates, may experience anxiety due to lack of clarity about procedural steps or the confusing physical infrastructure, and may not want to narrate the facts of the case in front of a lot of people.

POCSO Act and Rules have made provisions for child friendly treatment of child victims of sexual offences.

Section 36 of the POCSO Act, 2012 requires the Court to ensure that the child does not come in contact with the accused during the time of recording of the evidence. This can be done by providing a separate room in Court to record the child victim’s statements. Apart from that, the Court can also permit video conferencing, one- way mirrors, curtains, or any other devices to separate the child from the suspect while

recording the statement. Similarly, Maharashtra JJ Rules mandates that the Magistrate shall record the statement of the child in the Children’s room or, in a CCI in a child-friendly manner.

**Prerana Practices**



* **Orienting the team with the process of trial**: Prerana equips its team members with a thorough understanding of the trial process through regular training programs (both internal and external).
* **Ensuring that child-friendly practices are followed**: Prerana ensures that all child- friendly practices mandated by law are followed by the relevant law enforcement officers when interacting with the child victim to prevent re-victimization.
* **Accompanying the child to the court**: Case workers accompany the child to the court during the process of trial. The child may be expected to be present in the court for two or more such visits during the trial. The case workers, if appointed as Support Person may also extend this support to the child in the courtroom. This support is of utmost importance to the child considering the process of trial can be overwhelming and retraumatizing for the child.
* ** Keeping the child in the loop of all processes:** Case workers initiate the process of orienting the child about how the criminal justice system works, based on their age and understanding. They also accompany the child during the trial process and provide them with psychological support, when required. Case workers also keep the child informed about the progress of the case.
* **Extending emergency psychosocial support to the child**: The process of trial, especially the examination-in-chief and the cross examination may be mentally and emotionally exhausting for the child. Memories of traumatic incidents resurface and thus, the child may need immediate psychosocial assistance. The Counselor is informed about these processes well in advance so that they can be available if the child needs assistance during or after the process of trial.
*  **Liaising with the appointed Support Person**: Case workers stay in touch with the Support Person (if appointed by the CWC) and assist them in orienting the child for their role in the process of trial.
* **Communicating with the Public Prosecutor:** Case workers stay in touch with the Public Prosecutor either directly or through the police. This helps in getting relevant legal information on the case and keeping the child updated about the same.
* **Reaching out to pro-bono legal service providers**: Sometimes, Prerana seeks assistance from sensitized lawyers or organizations offering pro-bono legal services for child victims.
* **Creating and disseminating literature on Best Practices**: Prerana has published a document that emphasizes the victim-witness protection process, enumerating the provisions of the law along with the practices followed by the organization during the process of trial.

6.2. Care and Protection

6.2.1 Regular presentation of the victim before the CWC. 

A Child Welfare Officer or a Case Worker is appointed within the CCI to look after the care and development of a victim placed in institutional care and report the child’s progress to the Committee. 

The case worker also ensures that the child is presented before the CWC for regular follow-ups. During such follow-ups, the CCI is mandated to submit a progress report with the interventions planned for the child’s rehabilitation to the CWC. The CCI also sets up a Management Committee for monitoring the

progress of every child placed in a CCI. Regular presentation of the child before the CWC also provides them an opportunity to present their thoughts and grievances, if any. Maintaining regular contact between the child and CWC promotes the child’s participation in their rehabilitation plans.

Prerana’s field experiences reveal that a child feels cared for and satisfied when they are included in the planning of their future. The child also feels proud when their achievements are shared with the CWC and stays motivated to do better. Thus, maintaining** a healthy contact between the child and the CWC** goes a long way in building an environment of trust and safety. Some of the activities undertaken by Prerana are:



* **Presenting the child regularly before the CWC as ordered by them**: Prerana ensures that the child is presented before the CWC for regular follow-ups.
* **Ensuring that the child is present while obtaining a Renewal Order:** Prerana ensures that the child is present when the CWC issues the Renewal Order for the child’s stay in the CH.
* **Updating the CWC about the child’s progress:** Case workers submit progress reports and fulfill any other requests from the CWC related to reporting on the care and protection of the child.

6.2.2. Assessing the socio-economic background of the child and the family

Obtain information on the family’s inclination, capacity and plan for the child’s rehabilitation. The responsibility of conducting such an inquiry is assigned to the Child Welfare Officer or Case Worker.

Case workers use a socio-economic assessment called the **Social Investigation** to ascertain the family’s background and submit a report on the same to the CWC. Then, they prepare a report known as the **Social Investigation Report (SIR)** that documents the circumstances of the child’s family based on economic, social, psychosocial, and other relevant factors. The JJA states that children with unfit and incapacitated parents may be in need of care and protection.

Case workers thus investigate the vulnerabilities a child may be exposed to when restored with the family and whether the family members are willing and able to provide a safe and nurturing environment for the child. The report details the cultural practices of the family, their financial ability to look after the child, and social vulnerabilities (if any) in the child’s immediate environment. Case workers also add their own observations of the interactions conducted with the family and neighbors. The SIR as well as the child’s opinions on their rehabilitation help the CWC reach a decision that is in the best interest of the child.

**Prerana Practices**



* **Refining tools of inquiry:** Until 2016, SIRs were not as comprehensive to cover the status of the family and did not help the CWC much to make an informed decision. However, Prerana’s continuous input on strengthening and streamlining SIR helped develop a more effective process of conducting the inquiry that now helps the CWC make informed, evidence-based decisions on whether a child victim requires institutional care or is ready to be restored with their family.
* **Enriching the practice of Social Investigation beyond just family visits:** In addition to visiting the child’s residence, Prerana ensures that the case workers conduct a physical verification of the social environment of the child including visits to the child’s educational institution or a visit to the house of any other relevant family relative, and the parents’ place of employment for a thorough assessment. They also identify the likelihood of any other risk factors such as proximity to the traffickers’ family, threat from them or cases of substance abuse in the neighborhood that can be brought to the attention of the CWC.

For more information, read Prerana’s training guide for conducting a social investigation, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">‘Process to</span>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">conduct a Social Investigation: Guide</span>.’ #readinglist



* **Including case workers’ observations in the SIR**: Prerana emphasizes the importance of including ‘Observations of the Case Worker’ and ‘Recommendations of the Case Worker’ in the SIR to help the CWC make an informed decision. This includes observations that the case workers make based on the body language of the family members, interaction of the parents’ with the rest of the family, or the grievances of the household, plans of the family with regards to the child’s future, etc. In the SIR, the case worker also analyzes and presents any discrepancies in the statement of the child and the family.
* **Conducting capacity building programs: **Prerana initiated extensive capacity building sessions and training programs for case workers to improve their skills to conduct the inquiry and the documentation of SIRs.

6.2.3. Age Verification

The age of a victim rescued from sex trafficking is a major factor in deciding the course of their rehabilitation.

If the victim is under 18 years of age, the case falls under the jurisdiction of the CWC and the child victim is sent to a CH for care and protection. For victims over 18 years, the case does not fall under the purview of the JJA.

For victims over 18 years, the case does not fall under the purview of the JJA. The adult victims are sent to a Protective Home that provides them with the age-appropriate care and takes care of their protection needs. 

Their age is primarily ascertained by the CWC in the following ways. First, the authorities seek the birth certificate from the school (if the victim was previously part of the formal education system), or the matriculation or equivalent certificate from the concerned examination Board, if available. In case that is not available, the child’s Birth Certificate issued by a corporation or a municipal authority or a panchayat is sought.

If neither of these documents are made available to the CWC, only then the age of the victim is determined by an ossification test or any other latest medical age determination test conducted on the orders of the Committee. Post this assessment, it is important that the CWC for its own records, clearly states the date of birth/age of the child in their records.

**Prerana Practices**

Prerana has encountered cases where the **age verification medical examination** (AVM) would contradict the documents submitted by the family subsequently. The **AVM exam** would prove the victim to be a child, but the documents that the claimants would produce before the CWC showed them to be above the age of 18 years. It has been observed that claimants can sometimes forge or submit inauthentic documents in attempts to prove that a child is actually an adult (above 18 years). It is generally believed that it is easier to ‘free’ the victims if it is proved that they are above 18 years of age. It is a common belief among the claimants (often the traffickers themselves) that once the child is declared to be an adult, they would be eligible to be handed over to their immediate claimants. Thus, the documents submitted by the family as evidence to prove the child is actually an adult, ought to be thoroughly verified to ensure that the CWC has all the facts to determine the age of the victim. To protect the best interests of the children, Prerana undertakes the following activities:



* **Gathering the requisite documents from the family**: During the social investigation, case workers request the family for Birth Certificate or School Leaving Certificate of the victim to be presented to the CWC. Efforts are made to only take the photocopies of these documents and not the original ones.

In case these documents are not available during the preliminary visit, the case workers follow up

with the family to make these documents available for the CWC.



* **Suggesting the verification of the documents**: Prerana plays an active role in suggesting and assisting the CWC in verifying the documents gathered from the family or submitted by the family. It assists the CWC in issuing directions for verification of the documents by the issuing authority through the Police or Investigating Officer in case of uncertain facts coming to light.
* **Documenting case studies and practices about age verification**: Prerana publishes case studies that emphasize the need for determining the true age of the victim along with the procedure of verification and re-verification.

    For more information, read Prerana’s <span style="text-decoration:underline;">‘Case Study on Ascertaining the age of a rescued victim.</span>’ #Reading list


6.2.4. Inquiry into Propriety of Custody Claims

**When the Claimants approach the CWC for the custody of the child**

A child rescued from sex trafficking who has been placed in a CH can be restored to their family in two ways. First, the CWC conducts an inquiry to ascertain whether the child may be restored to the family. If the child’s safety is not at risk with their family, they may be restored with or without supervision of an external voluntary organization or the DCPU.

In cases where the family is not found to be capable of taking care of the victim, the child is placed in institutional care for a specific period, while positive interventions are undertaken with the child and the family to equip the family to take custody of the child.

Second, any individual who claims to be related to the child and is willing to look after the child can approach the CWC with relevant documents to request the custody of the child. The CWC uses the period of inquiry to understand if the person requesting such custody is equipped to look after the child. The CWC passes a Final Order after the completion of its inquiry, which includes assessing the socio-economic background of the child’s family along with the authenticity and lawfulness of the custody claims.



* Generally, the following aspects are included while ascertaining the proprietary and validity of the custody claims made by the family members:
* Identity proof of the claimants by a valid issuing authority
* Documentary evidence to prove relationship with the child (Birth Certificate, Ration Card, etc.)
* Documentary evidence to show financial capacity or source of income to look after the child
* Proof and nature of residence (temporary or permanent), etc.

After scrutinizing the facts and evidence produced before it, the CWC can either grant the custody of the child to the claimant or refuse to grant said custody. In its Order, the CWC must make a note of the procedure adopted to reach the conclusion and back it with reasons and evidence.

**When the claimants approach the court of law**

Sometimes, when the CWC makes a decision of institutionalizing a child, the claimants may approach the court of law to challenge this decision. This is done by filing a custody application to a higher court of law such as the District Sessions Court or the High Court.

Some of the instances include:



* Cases where parents of minor victims rescued from sex trafficking have filed a Habeas Corpus Writ Petition in the High Court, demanding the child to be produced before the Court.
* Cases where the Order of the CWC to place a child in the CH for their rehabilitation has been challenged in the District Sessions Court by way of appeal under Section 101 of JJ Act, 2015.
* Cases where parents of the child have moved to a higher court of law to prove the age of the victim to be over 18 years.

**Prerana Practices**



* **Coordinating with the claimants and the CWC**: Prerana actively coordinates with the claimants, updating them about the process of inquiry from time to time.. The case workers also coordinate with the claimants on producing the relevant essential documents before the CWC, as required.
* **Following up with the Court: **Case workers play an active role in assisting the CWC, if required when a case is being challenged in the Court. The Court may ask for evidentiary reasons as to why the child was not reunited with the claimants. The case worker may thus be required to submit the SIR as well as other documents, as requested by the Court in coordination with the CWC.
* **Verification of the documents:** Prerana assists the CWC to verify the personal documents and the residential proof of the claimants through the Police officials and avail the findings to make further decisions. The case workers also actively follow up with the Police.

6.2.5. Preparation of the Individual Care Plan (ICP) 

When a child is identified to be in need of care and protection, they may be placed in a CH. The tool used to identify the major areas of concern for the child along with proposed interventions to remedy the same is called an **Individual Care Plan (ICP)**. 

The ICP is prepared in consultation with the child to ensure that their needs and expectations are considered. The ICP is prepared by the case worker assigned to the child and is submitted to the CWC. Once prepared, the ICP is reviewed, implemented, and monitored regularly.

**Prerana Practices**



*  **Orienting the child with the process of ICP**: Case workers engage with the child to inform them about the ICP, the objective and the desired outcome of the same. Each section of the ICP template is explained to the child in terms of their rehabilitation.
* **Involving the child in the preparation of the ICP**: The inputs of the child are most valuable while preparing an ICP. Case workers discuss the needs and concerns of the child and include their expectations in the template. The case workers and the child together devise intervention plans to address the needs and concerns.
* **Reviewing the ICP with the child:** Case workers review the ICP with the child regularly to understand the progress made on the planned interventions. The case worker and child work together to review the concerns and the interventions planned in the past. To that end, an ICP serves as a dynamic tool to take care of the changing needs of the child.
* **Liaising with different stakeholders:** Prerana collaborates with different stakeholders for the effective implementation of the ICP like the hospital, mental health professional, educational professional, DCPU, DLSA, vocational service provider, etc.

6.3. Repatriation

6.3.1. Identifying Individual and ascertaining the Nationality of an

Amongst those rescued from sex trafficking, there may be children belonging to nations other than India who may be required to be repatriated and restored to their home country for further rehabilitation. In such a case, the District Child Protection Unit is responsible for initiating the process of repatriation.

Till the process of repatriation is initiated and completed, the child may be placed in a CCI for care and protection. Repatriation of a child victim rescued from sex trafficking to their home country can be of two types. Repatriation of a child victim rescued from sex trafficking to their home country can be of two types. They can either be restored to their family back home or transferred to a CCI in their home country.

**Prerana Practices**



* **Following up with the CSOs in the child’s home country**: Prerana collaborates with organizations in the child’s home country to conduct the initial assessment of the child’s family, neighborhood and social environment. It also follows up with the relevant offices in the child’s home country to further the process of repatriation and the support systems required for the child.
* **Providing procedural assistance to the child:** Case workers explain the procedures and laws to the child victim and also accompany them to the government offices when required. Extensive follow-ups are undertaken with relevant government and non- governme…

6.4. Challenges Faced While Addressing This Need



* ** Training the staff in the CH:** Often, it is time-consuming and resource- intensive to train the staff about the legal procedures to be followed during investigation and trial.
*  **Delays in legal procedures**: Delays in the completion of a criminal investigation hinders the process of prosecution and more importantly the process of rehabilitation of the victim.
*  **Lack of coordination between the police and the CCI staff**: Often, due to human resource-related challenges, it may be difficult for the CCI staff and the police to be in regular touch. Any disagreements between the police and the case workers may also result in disruption of the legal services to the child.
* **Lack of clarity for the child’s family about the legal procedures:** The child’s family members may be unclear about the role of the staff in the process of rehabilitation and restoration. The family may expect that the staff has the authority to release the child from the CH when they have a limited understanding of the process of inquiry or appeal. This may also affect the relationship of the child, the CCI staff and the family and working on family strengthening might also become a challenge.


## SOCIAL REINTEGRATION

7.1. Support Mechanisms

In cases where the victim turns 18 years of age and is not willing or ready to return home (be restored), they may be moved to an aftercare facility. In either case, a victim can only stay in a CH until they turn 18. Even as the child moves out of institutional care, they still need the support to transition into society. To facilitate the same, preparing the victim for life after institutional care begins while the child is in a CCI.

The case workers play an important role to help the child reintegrate into society. They conduct regular follow-up, assist the children in times of an emergency, and find them mentors to support. Such support mechanisms are also mandated by the CWC under the JJA in the form of follow-up directions.

**Prerana Practices**



* ** Creating a safety net for the child**: Before the child moves out of an institution, case workers ensure that the children are linked to individuals and organizations that can assist them with educational or vocational training, and financial or employment assistance.
* **Connecting the child with peer support groups**: Case workers connect the children with former residents or others who have been in institutional care to help them create a network of peers once they move out of the CH.
* **Maintaining a follow-up directory:** Prerana maintains the details of the children who have moved out of Naunihal. These children are informed that they can reach out to Naunihal for assistance even after they have moved out, if required.
* **Sharing an Exit Handout for children being discharged from CCIs**: Prerana shares important contact information with a child exiting the CCI – helpline numbers like child helpline number, police helpline number, location and details of one stop crisis center for women and children in distress, case workers from both NGO (if there is any associated with the case) and the CCI, child welfare committee, district legal services authority, etc.

7.2. Challenges Faced While Addressing This Need



* **Lack of support systems in the immediate social environment: **Lack of necessary support systems within the immediate social environment of the child may make the process of restoration and eventual social reintegration quite challenging.
* **Dependence on the CCI or CH**: Sometimes, individuals may develop an overdependence on the CCI and the staff. Thus, it might become difficult to wean out the support and help the child/ young adult in the process of social reintegration.
*  **Threats or vulnerabilities post social re-integration**: Threats and harassment from traffickers, exploiters, or family members can aggravate the disruption caused by the incidence of sexual violence in the life of the victim child and family and deepens the trauma already being experienced by them. The child’s and their family’s mobility and freedom may be severely curtailed. The child may be pulled out of school and confined to their homes in the name of safety. Many times, the child is shifted away from their families into CCIs or sent back to the village. There have been cases where the entire family has migrated to a different state because of the continuous threats and pressure from the larger community.
* **Refusal of the child to reintegrate in society**: Often, children may anticipate the threats mentioned above and may express their desire to not go back into such an environment. The CH or CCI need to be alert about such threats to the child in the education institution or place of work once they are restored with the family.
