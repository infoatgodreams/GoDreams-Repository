- What motivates the stakeholder to do certain things?
- What prevents the person from being able to do certain things?
- What triggers a decision/activity?
- What types of planning and negotiation (trade-offs) processes are taking place?
- What kind of behaviors and interactions take place?
- How are people communicating & sharing around products/decisions?
- What kind of artefacts are involved?
- What is the persons lifestyle?
- Who are the influencers/involved parties?
- How does this person manage their time?
- What are adaptations/work arounds in place for challenges?
- What does this stakeholder really care about?

# Ground rules
- "Can you show me how you do that?" is more valuable than "Can you tell me how you do that?". While doing, ask the participant to narrate what they are thinking
- Ask open ended "Why" and "Tell me more" and avoid leading questions such as "do you like this"
- Allow the participant to be the expert in the room
- Ask for stories " tell me about the last time you and the kids went out together?"
- Ask "na√Øve" questions
