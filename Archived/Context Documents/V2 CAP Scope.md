# Problem 

- **Lack of financial capital and attention in the space:** 
	- State funding into child care institutions is minimal, and continues to decrease year on year. This also results in a lack of attention to the space, a hostile or ineffectual policy environment for practitioners and lack of accurate on ground data for policy creation.
	- Private sector is not incentivized to fund CCIs outside of CSR
		- CCIs are often unable to qualify for funding due to capacity and capability deficits
	- Donations by individuals are often ad-hoc, irregular and highly dependent on visitation and interactions with children that are often detrimental to children's developmental outcomes. 
- **Lack of Scalability** due to 
	- Inability to standardize care practices
		- Tradition and trial and error based care practices are prevalent in most CCIs
		- CCIs lack the capacity to document care practices or develop training modules in-house
		- No comprehensive reference knowledge base or access to expertise via trainings or upskilling exists. 
		- CCIs operate in siloes and are unable to disseminate knowledge, best practices or learn from each-other
	-  Lack of qualified talent in the space:
		-  No feeder institutions 
		-  No opportunities to upskill or specialize in caregiving post hiring
		-  Low pay grade leading to ad-hoc hiring and under-qualified, dissatisfied staff
