#  Stakeholder Map
-  **Stakeholders:**
	- **Children**
		- Don’t have access to care
		- Poor quality of care
		- Ineffective inputs
		- Policies are disconnected from their reality (eg. blanket repatriation for runaway children to facilitate family preservation)
		- Short-term runway / abrupt exit
	-  **Children’s Homes**
		-  Lack of intellectual capital (1st principles of child care)\
		- Lack of money (financial capital)
		- Funding based on no. of children vs quality of care - which keeps discussions at basic inputs level vs growth or quality level. 
		- Lack of talent (people) -> not a professional discipline and hence no hiring pipeline.  
		- Hostile, disconnected, regulatory policy environment
		- Apathy & neglect from society & media 
		- Isolated / operate in silos
		- Personal, value based approach of leadership
		- Operates in a high risk environment with regular scrutiny / suspicion from others
		- Government 
		- Funders (i.e Corporates, Foundations, Philanthropists, Retail Donors)
		- Community / the Public / larger Society  
	- **Government:**
		- Lack of execution capacity 
		- Lack of data lending to prescriptive policy
		- Electorally insignificant constituency (no political advantage)
		- Long term nature of outcomes not aligned with election cycles
	- **Funders:**
		- Lack of impact measurement tools as outcomes are too long term and complex to track
		- Lack of credible at-scale operators
		- Comparatively high risk to goodwill and reputation in case of mishaps
		- A nascent uncrowded sector with high potential to establish legacy and thought leadership.
		- Community / the Public / larger Society
		- Misconceptions / flawed understanding of the sector
		- Generally suspicious of children’s homes due to sensationalised stories in the media
		- Understanding is limited to what is shown in movies and the media (sensationalised depiction of ground reality).
		- Wish to contribute but do not know how to be effective.
		- Brings input focused, charity mindset to the sector through ad hoc interactions, inadequate focus / recognition.
		- Does not think about the problem much -- general neglect and apathy


# Need
## Problem Definition
- Problem of Scale
	- Lack of intellectual capital 
		-  1st principles unknown
		- Trial and error, not science backed. No one unifying curriculum or knowledge base. 
	- Caregiving not a professional discipline
	- Training infrastructure is missing
- Lack of financial capital
	- Market Failure : Incentives in the market don't align with increasing the funding available to institutions. 
	- State Failure: The constituency of children in institutions is not electorally significant, leading to a lack of investment in the issue. 
- Problem of attention
	- Not a state priority: Lack of funding and time put into the space means the policy environment is hostile to on ground operators, as it is not based in data.
	- Not a societal priority: Charity mindset and ad-hoc inputs focused approach leads to neglect and apathy. Low media focus unless mishaps happen. 
- Problem of duration
	- Long time for outcomes to be visible: It might take 15-20 years for a child who enters the system to attain positive adult outcomes. 
	- Difficulty measuring outcomes: Due to the long duration for outcomes to become visible, the sector focusses primarily on measuring inputs
	- Consistency of inputs: For consistency and regularly of childhood inputs, funding needs to be sustainable and institutional stability/continuity is key. 
- Org Direction / Mission: An anchor institution operating in research, upgradation and aggregation of CCIs and operating on the ground to fill systemic gaps in India’s child care sector (ecosystem).
- The organization addresses various problems faced by the key stakeholders: 
	- Solve for scale 
	- Minimises risk 
	- Fills systemic gaps
	- Fixes knowledge deficit
	- Builds intellectual capital / establishes sector 
	- Capital mobilization & infusion



# Opportunities & Risks
- Opportunity / Risks:
- Operating at a training & partnership level, scaling quality child care by utilizing the reach of the 1000s of small, under-resourced neglected CCIs.
- Acquiring influence without risks associated with ownerships / operations. Can attach a name to it. Describe it as franchising instead of ownership. ie. Franchise 2.0, Acquisition 2.0.
- Due to the lack of profit motive, it is imperative that we work with existing players. 
- Scale issues due to lack of incentives. Strategically sacrifice some quality in the interest of scale.
- This plays the role of professionalizing the sector. Warden isn’t a profession like teacher, doctor or nurse. 
	- Advantages: 
	- asset light, 
	- cost-efficient, 
	- fast, 
	- breaks scale wall, 
	- side steps the regulatory risks
	- fills a crucial sector gap. 
- Infra upgrade is a lowest hanging, significant fruit that utilises partnership models to rapidly upgrade infrastructure in small CCIs. 
	- Advantages: fast, tangible, straight forward, CSR fit. 


# CAP Definition
- A vast majority of children living in CCIs are served by small, under-resourced, unorganized operators facing resource crunches in terms of know-how, finances, manpower and support systems. 
- The larger players invariably seem to hit a scale wall at around 5000-7000 children which is too small a number given the size of the problem (estimates of children-in-need-of-care-and-protection vary between 4 lakhs to 2 crores). 
- Besides this, the fact that state capacity is severely limited (<5% of CCIs in Bangalore, Chennai & Kochi), the only available solution to bring about sector level change in the quality of child care in the short & medium term is to work on aggregation and capacity building of the smaller, individual CCIs. In our opinion, this is also the most scalable model even in the long term. 
- The Capacity Accelerator Program is designed to help the small CCIs upgrade and build capacity to offer the gold standard in child care. The Program will provide a standardized framework for quality upgradation and support CCIs through grants, training and embedded management support. 
- This will give us the ability to ensure the delivery of quality child care at a scale beyond that which is achievable through a direct operator model. 
- Within 10 years, this Program will impact 70,000 children annually across 2000 CCIs in 20 cities while bringing an additional 300 Cr annual funding into the sector -- thereby altering the face of CCI ecosystem in India.
