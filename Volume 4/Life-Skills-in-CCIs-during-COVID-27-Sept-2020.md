INTRODUCTION
============

-   Life skills education is envisaged as a **rehabilitative service**
    > that should be available in all CCIs.

-   The JJ Act mandates life skills education as an **integral component
    > of the Individual Care Plan (ICP)** that is to be prepared for
    > every child.

-   A **duty has been placed on the functionaries responsible for
    > preparing this ICP** to ensure that concerns related to the
    > “self-care and life skill training for protection from all kinds
    > of abuse, neglect and maltreatment” are identified and
    > interventions planned in response to these concerns; and that
    > progress reports and pre-release reports on this are
    > also prepared.

-   **The Rehabilitation cum Placement Officer that is to be designated
    > in every CCI has been tasked with the responsibility to organize
    > workshops on life skills development, and to maintain a
    > Rehabilitation Card** in Form 14, to monitor the progress of the
    > child in terms of ‘Self Care and Life Skill Training for
    > Protection from all kinds of abuse, neglect and maltreatment’

-   UNICEF India defines life skills as **“a set of abilities, attitudes
    > and socio-emotional competencies that enable individuals to learn,
    > make informed decisions and exercise rights to lead a healthy and
    > productive life and subsequently become agents of change**.”

Guidelines for Facilitation of Activities
=========================================

-   **Create an enabling environment** where the children “feel
    > physically, socially and emotionally safe”.

-   Make an effort to **remain calm and cheerful**, and to create a
    > positive environment where all the children can feel comfortable
    > seeking information and understanding what is expected of them
    > and others.

-   **Demonstrate empathy and respect** for the children and their
    > emotions by acknowledging fears and anxieties, and model emotional
    > regulation and appropriate ways of expressing emotions.

-   Make it a point to **give positive feedback** to children, based on
    > what emerges during the activities.

Participation:
--------------

-   Participation of children should be **voluntary**.

-   **Seek the views of the children** about the activities they would
    > like to engage in and involve them in the process of conducting
    > the activities.

-   Be open and accepting. **Avoid judging children based on their
    > participatio**n or non- participation in the activities or their
    > behaviour during the activity.

-   To enable respectful listening during reflective activities,
    > consider adopting the guideline that only one person can speak at
    > a time and ensure that every child gets an opportunity to speak

Special support for children in CCIs
------------------------------------

-   Children in the juvenile justice system, including those housed in
    > CCIs, largely hail from extremely vulnerable backgrounds and are
    > exceedingly likely to have undergone adverse childhood
    > experiences (ACE) including recent traumatic experiences which led
    > them into the system itself.

-   Staff working in these settings also experience stress, given the
    > nature of the work, the lack of adequate trained support staff,
    > professionals etc.

-   **Take steps to engage with Trauma Informed Practice approaches and
    > provide Trauma- informed services** that place priority on the
    > individual’s safety, choice, and control while conducting these
    > activities, and strive to strengthen a culture of nonviolence,
    > learning, and collaboration.

Best Practices while conducting interactive sessions with children residing in CCIs in the context of Covid-19

    > and other matters relating to safety are adhered to.

    > the CCIs through the use of any form of technology as this is a
    > violation of the fundamental principles of right to privacy and
    > confidentiality and of safety

-   Try to **establish a routine for conducting sessions** in the CCI
    > with minimal disruptions, so as to maintain a sense of security
    > and wellbeing, while taking all measures to ensure the safety of
    > the children and the staff

-   Instruct the CCI staff member to confirm that all materials being
    > used for the activities have been **duly sanitized before use**.

-   Make every attempt to **ensure equal participation of children with
    > disabilities** in the interactions.

    > group or community for the pandemic.
