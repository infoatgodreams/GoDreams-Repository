#opinion - Mekha’s Note:

This article basically outlines the sexual abuse of boys (including victims and perpetrators) in Nepal. Imo since the demography of Nepal and India are similar, the paper is quite relevant. This paper is based on interviews conducted with victims, actors, parents and responders. By understanding the psyche of these stakeholder, I think we can design our own care practices based on this or at least make sure that the care practices we come up with takes into accounts the concerns mentioned in this paper.

## Theme of the study 



* Sexual violence affecting boys include both boys as a victim of sexual abuse and boys as an actor displaying harmful sexual behaviour. 
* 
* This study’s themes:
    * Masculinity/sexuality to find our the lived experiences in the context of sexuality and masculinities of boys; its social construction and impact on boys.
    * Sexual violence - to identify the links between the dominant notions of sexuality and masculinity with sexual abuse and harmful sexual behaviour of boys.
    * Existing best practices and challenges encountered and the way they were resolved 
* Social construction of masculinity is a major inducing factor that is contributing and creating the dissimilarities between boys’ and girl’s sexual abuse
* Socially constructed norms put pressure on boys to maintain their image of masculinity and heterosexuality.


# Sexual behavior of Children


## Harmful sexual behavior



* This is the sexual activity where one individual has not consented, or where their relationship includes an imbalance of power, eg: age, intellectual or physical ability or impairment
* The harm cause may be physical and/or psychological and/or emotional even though the behaviour is sexual.
* The child with harmful sexual behaviour may use grooming, coercion or threats or force to influence the other person to comply
* **This term is used because it is not appropriate to label a child’s behaviour as abusive or criminal.**
* The sexual harmful behaviour is due to an underlying vulnerability. 


## Problematic sexual behavior



* This is a behaviour that is a cause for concern in terms of the child’s age or developmental stage, according to the context - knowledge of sexual acts or use of secually explicit words or acts
* Children’s behaviour is termed problematic is the **behaviour** **is** **recurrent**
* Without intervention, this behavior may pose a risk to the child and other in the form of bullying, stigmatisation, development of the child’s sexual identity and vulnerability to sexual abuse. 
* Problematic sexual behaviour can be fdivided into two
    * Self-focussed behaviour: compulsive maturnation and excessive interest in pornopgraphy.
    * Interpersonal behavior: sexual games with friends, sharing pornography and spying on others.
* The behavior seen in younger children may not be considered as problematic yet. **Factors include whether it is spontaneous, not recurrent, the child has no inhibition and can stop the behaviour**

    
## Key Findings of this paper


#opinion: This paper is a qualitative study of victims and young actors (children who have abused), parents and first responders - interviews were conducted. Below is what I believe has come out of a human centric design approach of research through the interviews,


]
1. “Boys have strong heart but girls have soft heart”: the socio-cultural construction of masculinity
* Existing socio-cultural norms and practices appear to induce many of the dissimilarities in girls and boys. 
    * Eg: Boys allowed to raise their voice, be aggressive free to move around without restrictions and be dominant. Boys given more nutritious food than girls
    * Tradititional thoughts and practices like girls asked to do less work for income as they will marry and go to another house. 
* Perception of boys are constructed as brave and painless
    * “Boys do not cry”
    * “Fighting is a quality of boy” boys designate themselves as fighters and fearless”
* Notions of being teased, abused and dominated are linked to the treatment of girls without expressions of regret:
    * “Boys sexually abuse girls; girls do not sexually abuse others”
    * “Girls are dominated and teased, boys are not”
* **SUMMARY: The existing social construction of masculinity contributes to creating differences between boys and girls. Boys are socialised to be resilient and autonomous and to nurture qualities and attributes associated with male stereotypes of dominance and aggression**
2. Boys should be ‘prestigious in society’: roles and responsibilities of boyhood and manhood
* Common roles assigned to boys and men: protector and provider/income generator which are linked to status and symbols of power. Hence boys feel privileged but equally pressurized to fit into this image of masculinity.
* **The choice of boys’ childhood role models can affect the traits they are inspired to adapt into their manhood.**
* Boys’ choices of role model characters during this study predominantly symbolized the strength and power they are inspired to acquire in their manhood. Examples include actors, cartoon characters, gang leaders etc
* Participants appeared to identify some pressure to maintain stereotyped masculine traits such as virility or to rise to challenges
    * “You are male and should not be impotent, fulfil your responsibilities
3. Learning about sexuality, image and acceptable sexuality
* Learning about sexuality
    * Boys and parents reported that digital platforms such as mobiles, internet and TV are the primary mode through watching pornographic movies.
    * Also mentioned: Boys’ circle of friends, their families and society
        * “By hearing and seeing the talks and actions of villagers towards a married couple”
        * “Learnt from their parents, by watching them have sex and sleeping together”
        * “Overheard adults talk about it”
* Acceptable sexuality:
    * Majority of study participants mentioned that sexual activity should happen only after marriage. 
    * Not acceptable for boys to have sexual relationships with another boy. Only heterosexuality is accepted
        * “They will be called third gender:
        * “Such boys will be forced to marry a girl”
        * “He will be humiliated and some superstitious people will say: even if we just see such a guy, bad things will happen to us”
4. Implicit agreement, victims and perpetrators of sexual abuse and environment
* There is common understanding and an implicit agreement amongst society that girls are sexually abused because they are vulnerable. Boys are strong and are less vulnerable. Hence girls’ cases are reported more than boys’.
* It is probable that this implicit agreement is due to the external effects that are visible in the case of girls (pregnancy) whereas, in the case of boys such external effects are not clearly visible and other emotional and psychological effects are ignored
* Based on this study, the following was noted
    * Typical profile of victim of sexual abuse
        * They can be a victim anywhere
        * But more likely chances for street, innocent shy and younger boys
        * Also likely: boys who do drugs
    * Tactics used (similar for boys and girls) included
        * Intimidation or isolating victim (quiet place, covering mouth, toilets, touching and showing private parts)
        * Place of penetration is different for boys and girls.
    * Types of perpetrators - anyone which included
        * Girls who want money who lure them
        * Boys who cant find girls
        * Drug peddlers
        * Foreigners
        * Rich high class people who lure with promise of a job
5. ‘A victim becomes isolated’: the impact and response to sexual abuse’
* You can see physical impacts of sexual abuse on victim:
    * Different kind of diseases
    * Trouble going to toilet or walking
    * Itching problems
    * Mental retardation
* Emotional impact of sexual abuse appears to be particularly traumatic for boys because of the conception of masculinity - they cant disclose emotions. Victims feel that they will be humiliated by other people
* Emotional impact were highlighted by both actors and victims of sexual abuse. Manifestation of this includes
    * Blame himself and even leaves homes
    * Victim starts hurting himself
    * Boys will want to do more drugs
    * Suicidal tendencies
    * Feelings of loss, anger, hate, fear, confusion
* Response of victim’s family, friends and society is extremely important for the survival and existence of a victim
* Family’s response has included
    * Purposefully ignoring their exploitation
    * Discriminating against them
    * Disowning them
    * Suppport
* It is confusing for a boy to understand why the abuse happened that they felt anger, rage and fear, but **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">the way family, friends and society reacted and responded to their pain and emotion linked to their future coping mechanisms</span>**
6. Legal process and reporting boy’ sexual abuse
* Lower cases of boys’s abuse being reported than girls. Reasons include	
    * People are hesitant to come forward
    * Legal process is lengthy
    * Scared of police and NGOs. ( fear of getting hit or scolded)
    * Hard to explain abuse to authorities
    * Abuser threatens victim. There is a fear that they will be re-victimized. 
    * Fear if parents finding out
    * Lack of awareness or knowledge about topic of boys’ sexual abuse
    * In Nepal, legal ambiguities around the sexual abuse of boys - as an ‘unnatural act’ act - lead to silenced voices of the victim and unreported cases. 


## Recommended Interventions:



* Address the existing social construction of masculinity that creates differences in gender and supports in ignoring the voices of boys
    * Provide equal opportunity of education
    * Same level of work, protection love and care
    * Include information about vulnerability of boys
* Victims of sexual abuse are linked to reponsible authority personnel like child protection offices, police, medical persons and lawyers for further support such as medical aid, pycho-social support and legal services
* Link boys as actors of harmful sexual behavior with pyscho-social counsellors for further support and guidance
* Raise self-confidence of boys affected by sexual violence through lifeskills training
* **Enable boys to understand their emotions and educate them about sex, sexuality,** **masculinity, sexual violence and self-protection/defence mechanisms**
* Run awareness campaigns with parents and local communities
