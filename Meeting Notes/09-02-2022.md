## Inputs on the reading logistics: 

**1. Process streamlining is crucial to ensure a few things:**
- Improved clarity about the end product for Glo & Meks to get their notes in better shape
- Real-time problem solving takes away attention from the process and changes pace.
- Reading unrelated papers is minimal keeping time constraints in mind. 
- Need to extract the most value out of CAP3, look at CAP like we look at volunteers; iron out the process and create a solid tutorial. 

**1. Need to spend money **now**** 
- Not spending upfront affects the process efficiency
Immediate fixes: 
-Figure out process flow for unhighlightable papers- Do they exist in editable format on certain subscriptions? 
-Create a tutorial on using tags effectively- Keep the note instructions updated. 

## Reading Journal (Imp takeaways) 
- Nepal's demography is similar to us, the behaviour analysis and qualitative studies can also apply to us. 
- Can we design an assessment to ascertain where children are on sex education? What are their preconceived ideas before entering the CCI or currently? 
- How do we design language knowing that everyday language can lead to how we perceive gender and sex? 
- Note: **Human Centred Design** looks really important here. 
- With well-prepared caregiving modules, like the one offered by Prerna, how do we deliver the content in the most effective way? Should consider getting animators or behaviour comms folks as SMEs.
- Are there studies on LGBTQ children in CCI? 
- Can we read more about how to deal with adolescent kids? This seems to be a common CCI concern
