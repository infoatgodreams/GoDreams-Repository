Inputs on the reading logistics: 

1. Process streamlining is crucial to ensure a few things: 
- There isnt a major backlog on obsidian for CAP3 Notes 
- Improved clarity about the end product for Glo & Meks to get their notes in better shape
- Real-time problem solving takes away attention from the process and changes pace.
- Reading unrelated papers is minimal keeping time constraints in mind. 
- Need to extract the most value out of CAP3, look at CAP like we look at volunteers; iron out the process and create a solid tutorial. 

1. Need to spend money **now**
- We have 3L that need to be spent this quarter 
- Not spending upfront affects the process efficiency
Immediate fixes: 
-Figure out process flow for unhighlightable papers- Do they exist in editable format on certain subscriptions? 
-Create a tutorial on using tags effectively- Keep the note instructions updated.
