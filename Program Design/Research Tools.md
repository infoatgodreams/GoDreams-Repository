# Literature Review


## Documentation

- Google Drive
		 - We continue to use google drive to: 
		 		 - Facilitate Discussions  and 'whiteboarding' with google sheets
		 		 - Capture meeting notes
		 		 - Collaborative editing of rolls ups and other context documents
		 - This is because: 
		 		 - Collaborative Features
		 		 - Integrated with email and google suite
- Obsidian
	- We are using Obsidian to: 
		- Capture literature review notes and summaries
		- Identify important topics and keywords
		- Present our readings
	- This is because: 
		- It is easy to link related topics using tags, links or just similar context
		- Files are in text format and stored/backed up across multiple devices, and hence is future proof

## Task Management

- Trello
	- We are using Trello to: 
		 - Manage Task Lists and Operational elements of the program
	- This is because:
		-  Collaborative features
		-  Topic wise task lists
		-  Opening & Closing tasks easy and trackable.
