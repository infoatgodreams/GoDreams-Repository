# Primary Research
## üí¨ Immersion Phase
### Goal
Work closely with 10 CCIs  to decode : 
1. What are the current practices and outcomes of  CCIs in the domains, sub-domains and key areas identified in the secondary research
2. Map and evaluate the support ecosystem available to CCIs
3. Identify the challenges preventing CCIs from adopting best practices and create case studies for the same
4. Convert case studies into design problems for the design sprint

## üè†CCI Landscape Survey
1. Build a basic profile of CCIs across the country through quantitative data towards future use in city expansion and demographic context
2. What does the current ecosystem around CCIs across the country look like in terms of stakeholders and services available to them? 
3. Identify challenges preventing CCIs across the country from adopting best practices and create 1 case profile per city 
4. Convert case profiles into design problems for the design sprint
