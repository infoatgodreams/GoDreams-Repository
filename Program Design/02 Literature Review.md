# üèπ **Goal** 
To put together information in core areas of program development and draw insights that will allow us to : 

1.  Identify questions for primary research : ==What don't we know about how CCIs in India operate?==
2. Avoid reinventing the wheel during program design : ==What have others in the sector done already?==
3. Identify key levers and critical factors that influence the care quality at CCIs  based on existing studies/practices in the sector under the following categories: 
	- ==Gold Standard Practices and outcomes under all domains== :
		-  Best Practices and Inputs
		-  M&E and Outcome Measurements
		-  Successful Interventions
	- ==Baseline/Current Reality for childcare under all domains:==
		- Gaps observed specifically in institutional care
		- Outcome Measurements
4.	 Identify ==innovations in associated sectors== and document potential practices that can be implemented in CCIs.
