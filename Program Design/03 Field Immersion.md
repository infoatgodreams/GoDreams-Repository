# üí¨ In-depth immersion in CCIs
## Goal
- Identify key leverage points in each domain area
- Evaluate ease of adoption for trainings, tech, embedded management andfinancial grants

## **Stakeholders**

1. CCI Leadership
2. Caregiving Staff
3. Non-caregiving staff
4. Resident unpaid staff
5. Children (12-18)
6. Children (4-12)


## **2 layers of observation for each question :**

1. Stakeholder Point of View
	  1. What does the stakeholder articulate without prompting?
	  2. What does the stakeholder articulate after asking &quot;5 why&#39;s&quot;
2. Surveyor Point of View
	  1. What are the surveyors observations about the stakeholders reaction when asked the question (intonation, body language)
	  2. What is the most accurate answer to the question asked, in the surveyors estimation?



## **What do we want to learn?**

1. **Domain Incentives** : What are the current practices and outcomes of CCIs in the domains, sub-domains and key areas identified in the secondary research? Identify the challenges preventing CCIs from adopting best practices and create case studies for the same.
	  1. **For Each Domain**
		    1. What is the primary goal of each stakeholder under this domain? Within the goal, what does their priority list look like?
		    2. What are the areas that they are performing well in?
			      1. What solutions have they been relying on for these areas?
			      2. What would be their ideal solution?
		    3. What are the areas that they are struggling with?
			      1. What solutions have they been relying on for these areas?
			      2. What would be their ideal solution?
		    4. What are the visible outcomes for this domain?
			      1. What outcomes are the stakeholders measuring/aware of?
		    5. What are the visible inputs for this domain?
			      1. What are the inputs that are intentional/unintentional?
		    6. What are the best practices CCI leadership are aware of and interested in implementing?What are the best practices that other caregiving/non-caregiving stakeholders are aware of and interested in implementing?
			      1. How many of these best practices are implemented? Fully, Partially, Failed ?
			      2. What are the factors that influenced successful or unsuccessful implementation? Roadblocks, trade-offs, constraints?
			      3. What are the internal and external constraints preventing best practice implementation for this domain?
		    7. Draw a relationship map between the different players &amp; interactions in the domain (internal &amp; external).
		    8. What are the physical infrastructures that contribute towards the domain goal?
		    9. What does the stakeholders workstack look like?
			      1. Map the stakeholders activities across a day schedule and a week schedule

1. **Stakeholder Incentives:** Who are the stakeholders? Map and evaluate the internal and external support ecosystem available to CCIs and caregiving/non-caregiving staff at the CCIs
	  1. **Who is the stakeholder?**
		    1. Who is the stakeholder? What is their background, life history?
		    2. What are their primary motivations for doing what they do?
		    3. What are their life and career goals? What are their monetary aspirations?
		    4. What are their goals for the CCI? What are their intrinsic goals and what are the goals handed down to them?
		    5. What are their life and career challenges?
		    6. What are their challenges at the CCI?
		    7. Draw a relationship map for each stakeholder. Include personal and professional relationships and explain the interactions.
	  2. **What are their support goals?**
		    1. What are the support goals for each stakeholder? What are their key challenges, complaints, roadblocks etc.
		    2. What are their outside of work constraints, commitments and challenges?
		    3. What are the existing internal (driven by the NGO) support systems available to each stakeholder?
		    4. What are the external(other orgs, govt., donors, family etc.) support systems available to each stakeholder?
		    5. Have they interacted with external coaches/managers/support staff? What was their experience like? Pros/Cons
		    6. Have they interacted with tech solutions?What was their experience like? Pros/Cons
		    7. What is their history with training and upskilling toward their job role? What was their experience like? Pros/Cons
		    8. What are their current financial incentives? What would they like to keep and change about this? Do they have liabilities?

# üè†CCI Landscape Survey
1. Build a basic profile of CCIs across the country through quantitative data towards future use in city expansion and demographic context
2. What does the current ecosystem around CCIs across the country look like in terms of stakeholders and services available to them? 
3. Identify challenges preventing CCIs across the country from adopting best practices and create 1 case profile per city 
4. Convert case profiles into design problems for the design sprint
