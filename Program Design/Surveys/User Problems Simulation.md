# What is this about?

One of the key data points to unlock would be most common problems/barriers faced while working towards adult outcomes for children, by us (Guardians), the CCIs and other stakeholders who will use our solution.

```co
For example, if one were to ask a funder "Have you faced any issues while funding this CCI?", what would they say?

If we can solve for this within CAP, then we ensure that the funder is invested in our solution and continues to encourage its use/use it. 
```

Here it is ==**important that we wear the shoes of our primary roles and the role of the stakeholders, and not limit ourselves by thinking only about CAP objectives.**== Although CAP objectives remain a sub-set of our primary roles, and hence can be included. 

- There are 4 core parties that are invested in our solution
	- **Us (Guardians)** : What are the niggles we faced in our roles while working with CCIs?
	- **CCI Leadership, Caregiving Staff and Admin Staff** : What are the problems we have seen or assume that a CCI authority would articulate?
	- **Children in CCIs** : What are the problems we have seen or assume that a child would articulate?
	- **CCI Funders** : What are the problems we have seen or assume that a donor (either individual or corporates) would articulate?


```co
Why this exercise? To identify what the most common and crucial problems are for key users before we build a solution 
```
```co
How do we do this? Draw on your experience with CCI stakeholders to wear their hat, simulate their environment and identify problems from their point of view
```
```co
What does it look like? We are capturing data in the form of the attached survey, multiple entries are encouraged! None of the Qs are compulsory, so even partially formed thoughts work
```
