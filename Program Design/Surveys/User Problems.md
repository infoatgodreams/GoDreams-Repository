# What is this about?

One of the key data points to unlock would be problems that we, the CCIs and other stakeholders that our solution will be used by face. 

```co
For example, if one were to ask a funder "Have you faced any issues while funding this CCI?", what would they say?

If we can solve for this within CAP, then we ensure that the funder is invested in our solution and continues to encourage its use/use it. 
```
- There are 4 core parties that are invested in our solution
	- **Us (Guardians)** : What are the niggles we faced in our roles while working with CCIs?
	- **CCI Leadership, Caregiving Staff and Admin Staff** : What are the problems we have seen or assume that a CCI authority would articulate?
	- **Children in CCIs** : What are the problems we have seen or assume that a child would articulate?
	- **CCI Funders** : What are the problems we have seen or assume that a donor (either individual or corporates) would articulate?

```co
Why this exercise? To simulate stories that build a narrative of what the most common and crucial problems are
