# What is this about?

- One of the key data points to unlock would be problems that we have faced through our work with CCIs.  
	- For example, if one were to ask a funder "Have you faced any issues while funding this CCI?", what would they say? If we can solve for this within CAP, then we ensure that the funder is invested in our solution. 
	- There are 3 key parties that are invested in our solution
		- Us (Guardians) : What are the niggles we faced in our roles while working with CCIs?
		- CCI Leadership, Caregiving Staff and Admin Staff : What are the problems we have seen or assume that a CCI authority would articulate?
		- Children in CCIs : What are the problems we have seen or assume that a child would articulate?
		- CCI Funders: What are the problems we have seen or assume that a donor (either individual or corporates) would articulate?
