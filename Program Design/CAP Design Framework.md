## Problem
Quality of care delivered at Child Care Institutions is on average inadequate and widely disparate. 

## Constraints
- CCIs are under-resourced and short staffed
- There is a skill gap and talent shortage in CCI management
- There is limited funding available in the sector
- State cannot be relied upon as the sole arbiter of quality of institutional care. CCIs operate in silos. 

## Program Goals
- Increase funding available to CCIs to sufficient levels based on target care quality.
    
- Increase KSM (Knowledge, Skills, Mindsets) of CCI staff and management to sufficient levels based on target care quality. 
    
- Enable, Ensure and Incentivize the continuous maintenance of care quality at sufficient levels across CCIs
    
## Design Challenge

1.  What is the most efficient path to providing quality care for a Child Care Institution? 
    
2.  What is the fastest path to increasing the total pool of funding available in the sector?
    
3.  How can A) and B) be delivered to ensure sustainable upkeep of quality of care?
