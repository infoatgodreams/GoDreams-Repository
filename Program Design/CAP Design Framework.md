## Design Challenge

1. How do we define, clarify and communicate gold standard care in Institutions?
2. What is the most efficient path for baseline CCIs in India to meet gold standard care?
3. How do we inherently link funding going into CCIs to Childhood and Adult Outcomes?
4.  How can A) and B) be delivered to ensure sustainable upkeep of quality of care?
