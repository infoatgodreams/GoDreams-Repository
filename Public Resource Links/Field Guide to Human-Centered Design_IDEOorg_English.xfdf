			<contents>STEPS 01
Start by taking a first stab at writing your design challenge. It should be short and easy to remember, a single sentence that conveys what you want to do. We often phrase these as questions which set you and your team up to be solution-oriented and to generate lots of ideas along the way.
02 Properly framed design challenges drive toward ultimate impact, allow for a variety of solutions, and take into account constraints and context. Now try articulating it again with those factors in mind.
03 Another common pitfall when scoping a design challenge is going either too narrow or too broad. A narrowly scoped challenge won’t offer enough room to explore creative solutions. And a broadly scoped challenge won’t give you any idea where to start.
04 Now that you’ve run your challenge through these filters, do it again. It</contents>

4) Finally, write down some of the context and constraints that you’re facing. They could be geographic, technological, time-based, or have to do with the population you’re trying to reach.
Because children aren’t in control of their circumstances, we wanted to address our solution to their parents. We want a solution that could work across different regions.

WHAT YOU’LL NEED Pen, paper, Post-its, calendar
PARTICIPANTS Design team
01 A good place to start is with a calendar. Print out or make a large one and put it up in your workspace. Now mark key dates. They could be deadlines, important meetings, travel dates, or times when your team members are unavailable.
02 Now that you’ve got a sense of your timeline, look at your budget and staff. Do you have everything that you’ll need? If you foresee constraints, how can you get around them?
03 You’ll need to get smart on your topic before you head into the field. Who should you talk to now? What will you need to read to be up to speed on your challenge?
04 Answer questions like: When should my team head into the field? Will my team make one visit or two? Will our partners be visiting? Will we need to physically make something? How much time, money, and

			<contents>STEPS 01
First, assess how many team members you’ll need, your staff’s availability, and when your project should start and end.
02 Look at the core members of your team and determine what they’re good at and what they’re not so good at.
03 Is there a clear technical capability that you’ll need but don’t currently have—maybe a mechanical engineer, a graphic designer, a skilled writer? Remember that you can always add a team member for
a shorter period of time when their skills are most important.</contents>

As you start to determine who you want to talk to, think about a variety of factors: age, gender, ethnicity, class, social position. Who do you really need to hear from?
02 Be sensitive to gender when making your Interview plan. Some communities may not be comfortable with men interviewing women. Or if you’re working on a touchy topic, like open defecation, make sure that you understand social dynamics before you begin your Interviews (p. 39).
03 Group Interviews (p. 42) can be a highly useful tool and also help you identify who you might like to speak more with in an individual Interview.
04 Refer to Extremes and Mainstreams (p. 49) to make sure that you’re
talking to a broad spectrum of people.</contents>

01 Once you know your design challenge, it’s time to start learning about its broader context. You can bone up quickly by exploring the most recent news in the field. Use the Internet, newspapers, magazines, or journals to know what’s new.
02 Try to find recent innovations in your particular area. They could be technological, behavioral, or cultural. Understanding the edge of what’s possible will help you ask great questions.
03 Take a look at other solutions in your area. Which ones worked? Which ones didn’t? Are there any that feel similar to what you might design? Any solutions that have inspired you to make one of your own?
04 Because Interviews (p. 39) can be highly subjective, use your Secondary Research to get the facts and figures you’ll need to understand the
context of your challenge.</contents>

WHAT YOU’LL NEED Pens, paper, Interview Guide worksheet p. 166
PARTICIPANTS Design team, person you’re designing for
01 No more than three research team members should attend any single Interview so as to not overwhelm the participant or crowd the location. Each team member should have a clear role (i.e. interviewer, note-taker, photographer).
02 Come prepared with a set of questions you’d like to ask. Start by asking broad questions about the person’s life, values, and habits, before asking more specific questions that relate directly to your challenge.
03 Make sure to write down exactly what the person says, not what you think they might mean. This process is premised on hearing exactly what people are saying. If you’re relying on a translator, make sure he or she understands that you want direct quotes, not the gist of what the person says.
04 What you hear is only one data point. Be sure to observe the person’s body language and surroundings and see what you can learn from the context in which you’re talking. Take pictures, provided you get
permission first.</contents>

			<contents>01 Identify the sort of group you want to talk with. If you’re trying to learn something specific, organize the group so that they’re likely to have good answers to the questions that you’ve got.
02 Convene the Group Interview on neutral ground, perhaps a shared community space that people of all ages, races, and genders can access.
03 In a Group Interview, be certain to have one person asking the questions and other team members taking notes and capturing what the group is saying.
04 Come prepared with a strategy to engage the quieter members of the group. This can mean asking them questions directly or finding ways to make the more vocal members of the group recede for a moment.
05 Group Interviews are a great setting to identify who you might want to go
deeper with in a Co-Creation Session (p. 109).</contents>

WHAT YOU’LL NEED Pens, camera, notebook
PARTICIPANTS Design team, expert
Determine what kind of expert you need. If you’re working in agriculture, perhaps an agronomist. In reproductive health? A doctor or policymaker may be a good bet.
02 When recruiting your experts, give them a preview of the kinds of questions you’ll be asking and let them know how much of their time you’ll need.
03 Choose experts with varying points of view. You don’t want the same opinions over and over.
04 Ask smart, researched questions. Though you should come prepared with an idea of what you’d like to learn, make sure your game plan is flexible enough to allow you to pursue unexpected lines of inquiry.
05 Record your Expert Interview with whatever tools you have. A pen and
paper work fine.</contents>

			<contents>01 With your team, write down the people or groups that are directly involved in or reached by your project. Are you designing for children? For farmers? Write all the groups down on Post-its and put them on a wall so you can visualize your audience.
02 Now add people or groups who are peripherally relevant, or are associated with your direct audience.
03 Think about the connections these people have with your topic. Who are the fans? Who are the skeptics? Who do you most need on your side? Add them to the wall.
04 Now arrange these Post-its into a map of the people involved in your challenge. Save it and refer to it as you move through the

WHAT YOU’LL NEED Pens, notebook
PARTICIPANTS Design team, people you’re designing for
Determine what you want the people you’re designing for to react to. If you’re designing a sanitation system you might come up with a bunch of Conversation Starters around toilets or privacy.
02 Now come up with many ideas that could get the conversation started. What is the toilet of the future, the toilet of the past, a super toilet, the president’s toilet? Come up with a list of ideas like this to share with the person you’re designing for.
03 Once you’re with the person you’re designing for, start by telling them that you’re interested in their reactions to these Conversation Starters. Some may be silly, some may be absurd, you’re only looking to get their opinions.
04 As the person you’re designing for shares her take on your Conversation Starters, be open to however she interprets the concepts. When one of them strikes her, ask more questions. You can learn a lot about how she thinks and what she might want
out of your solution.</contents>

			<contents>STEPS 01
Think about all the different people who might use your solution. Extremes can fall on a number of spectrums and you’ll want variety. Maybe you’ll want to talk to someone who lives alone and someone who lives with a large extended family. Maybe you’ll want to talk to both the elderly and children. Each will offer a take on your project that can spur new thinking.
02 When you talk to an extreme, ask them how they would use your solution. Ask them if they use something similar now and how it does or does not suit their needs.
03 Select appropriate community contacts to help arrange meetings and individual Interviews. Make sure you’re talking to men and women. You might even stumble across an extreme user in another context and want to talk to them there.
04 Be sensitive to certain extremes when you Interview them. They may often be left out of discussions like these so make them feel welcome
and let them know that their voices are critical to your research.</contents>

			<contents>01 As you Create a Project Plan (p. 34), budget enough time and money to send team members into the field to spend time with the people you’re designing for. Try to organize a homestay if possible.
02 Once you’re there, observe as much as you can. It’s crucial to record exactly what you see and hear. It’s easy to interpret what’s in front of you before you’ve fully understood it, so be sure you’re taking down concrete details and quotes alongside your impressions.
03 A great Immersion technique is to shadow a person you’re designing for a day. Ask them all about their lives, how they make decisions, watch them socialize, work, and relax.
04 If you’ve got a shorter window for Immersion, you can still learn a lot by following someone for a few hours. Pay close attention to the
person’s surroundings. You can learn a lot from them.</contents>

			<contents>01 On a large sheet of paper, list the distinct activities, behaviors, and emotions you’re looking to research.
02 Next to each one, write down a setting or situation where you might observe this activity, behavior, or emotion. For example, if the activity is “use a device at the same time every day,” parallel situations might be how people use alarm clocks.
03 Have the team vote on the site visits that they would like to observe for inspiration and arrange for an observation visit.
04 When you make your visit, pay close attention to what it is you want to
understand, but remain open to all kinds of other inspiration.</contents>

WHAT YOU’LL NEED Premade cards on p. 168 or your own cards
PARTICIPANTS Design team, person you’re designing for
01 Make your own deck of cards or use the cards provided in the Resources section on p. 168. If you’re making your own cards, use either a word or a picture on each card. Whatever you select, make sure that it’s easy to understand. Pictures are a better choice if the person doing the Card Sort speaks another language or cannot read.
02 When tailoring your deck of cards to your precise research objectives, be sure that you’re mixing concrete ideas with more abstract ones. You can learn a lot about how the person you’re designing for understands the world by making this exercise more than just a simple ranking.
03 Now give the cards to the person you’re designing for and ask her to sort them according to what’s most important.
04 There are a couple variations on this Method that work nicely: Instead of asking the person you’re designing for to rank the cards in order of preference, ask her to arrange them as she sees fit. The results might surprise you. Another tweak is to pose different scenarios. Ask the person you’re designing for how she would sort the cards if she had
more money, if she were old, if she lived in a big city.</contents>

There are a number of ways you can get a person you’re designing for to observe and document her peers and community. Start by determining how you want to learn. It could be through Interviews (p. 39), photos, Collages (p. 61), Card Sorts (p. 57), etc.
02 Outfit the person you’re designing for with what she’ll need—a camera perhaps, art supplies, a notebook pen—and take her through the observation and reporting process.
03 Offer support throughout the observation and reporting process. Make certain that she knows that there is no right answer and that you only want the honest opinions, hopes, and fears of the people she talks to.
04 When she’s done, collect what she’s produced, but also be sure to Interview her about how the process went. You’ll want more than just the facts, so be sure to find out what surprised or inspired her, how her opinions might have changed, and what she learned about
her peers.</contents>

WHAT YOU’LL NEED Pens, paper, camera
PARTICIPANTS Design team, person you’re designing for
Arrange with someone you’re designing for to get a Guided Tour of her home or workplace. Cultural and gender dynamics may come into play when you visit someone’s home, so be sensitive to those issues and make sure you’ve got full permission before your visit.
02 Come with just two team members, one to ask questions and the other to take notes. Pay close attention to the space that you’re visiting, the rituals you see there, what’s on the walls, who uses it, and where it’s located. All are key pieces of information.
03 Only take photos if you can get permission.
04 Ask lots of questions about the person’s habits and space. Why does she do the things she does? Who uses the space? Where are things
kept? Why are things organized the way that they are?</contents>

WHAT YOU’LL NEED Pens, notebook
PARTICIPANTS Design team, person you’re designing for
01 Make sure you have a pen and paper handy when talking with the people you’re designing for. Even a sheet torn out of your notebook works great.
02 When you want the person you’re designing for to draw something, give them a clear idea of what you’re after. A map of their daily route? A timeline of their annual income? What percentage of their fields are dedicated to a certain crop?
03 The person you’re designing for may feel intimidated or that she’s not a good artist. Help her over that fear. Or be the one to draw first so that she doesn’t feel embarrassed.
04 You can use the drawings as Conversation Starters (p. 45). This Method can get you to a deeper understanding of the person you’re designing for
so investigate what they’ve drawn.</contents>

			<contents>STEPS 01
See if any of the people you’re Interviewing want to draw. If so, let them. If not you can do it as well.
02 List or draw everything that brings money into the house. Remember that assets may not always be currency.
03 Now list or draw everything that takes money out of the household.
04 Start asking questions about what you see. What’s the most expensive thing he buys, what can’t he live without, what is there never enough money for? Have the person you’re designing for rank both inputs and outputs in terms of value. Find out how frequently money comes in and goes out. Use the lists to get a full picture of their finances.
05 A nice additional step is to map these inputs and outputs on a calendar. You might find that money comes in all at once but has to be paid out bit by bit. Or that though you’re not talking to a farmer, her income may be
tied to an agricultural cycle.</contents>

Take turns downloading. Start by getting rid of other distractions and sitting in a circle.
02 When it’s your turn, put all key information you want to share on Post-its and use them as you describe who you met, what you saw, the facts you gathered, and your impressions of the experience.
03 Cluster the Post-its together as you put them on the wall or on a board so that you have a record of your discussion.
04 When it’s not your turn, pay close attention. Feel free to ask questions if something isn’t clear.
05 This process is best done the day of an Interview (p. 39) or after a day in
the field. Download while your experiences and perceptions </contents>

02 Tell the most compelling stories from the field to your teammates. Try to be both specific (talking about what actually happened) and descriptive (using physical senses to give texture to the description). Report on who, what, when, where, why, and how. And then invite each of your teammates to share their own inspiring stories.
03 As you listen to your teammates’ stories, write down notes and observations on Post-its. Use concise and complete sentences that everyone on your team can easily understand. Capture quotes, the

			<contents>STEPS 01
This easy synthesis tool can help you prioritize, communicate, and strategize with your team.
Gather your team and have everyone write down the Top Five ideas jumping out at them.
02 Share your Top Fives and cluster similar ideas. This is a great way to reveal what’s most interesting or important at a given time.
03 Consider doing this exercise often. And vary the time frame. What’s your team’s Top Five for the day? How about for the week? You can also use this tool to pull out the Top Five biggest challenges you face, or the Top Five crazy ideas you want to try.
04 When it’s not your turn, pay close attention. Feel free to ask questions if something isn’t clear.
05 Keeping and displaying the Post-its with your Top Fives is also a great way
to watch your project evolve and to remind yourse</contents>

02 Look for patterns and relationships between your categories and move the Post-its around as you continue grouping. The goal is to identify key themes and then to translate them into opportunities for design.
03 Arrange and rearrange the Post-its, discuss, debate, and talk through what’s emerging. Don’t stop until everyone is satisfied that the clusters represent rich opportunities for design.
04 Identifying these themes will help you Create Frameworks (p. 89) and

			<contents>STEPS 01
Take the themes that you identified in Find Themes (p. 80) and put them up on a wall or board.
02 Now, take one of the themes and rephrase it as a short statement. You’re not looking for a solution here, merely transforming a theme into what feels like a core insight of your research. This is a building block, not a resolved question.
03 Once you’ve done this for all the themes, look back at your original design challenge. Sift through your insight statements and discard the ones that don’t directly relate to your challenge. You only want three to five insights statements.
04 Take another pass at refining your insights. Make sure that they convey the sense of a new perspective or possibility. Consider inviting someone who is not part of your team to read your insight statements and see how they
resonate.</contents>

PARTICIPANTS Design team
There are lots of ways to Explore Your Hunch. You could run a quick Brainstorm (p. 94). Or build a prototype. Or maybe run your idea past someone in an Expert Interview (p. 43).
02 Start by articulating your hunch to your teammates and get their feedback. It could be that one of them is thinking along the same lines.
03 Next, determine the best way to explore the idea. What do you need to uncover and understand to validate or disprove your idea?
04 Remember that even if your hunch is wrong, there are still lots of learnings
to be had. Remain open to them and capture them as you go.</contents>

			<contents>STEPS 01
Start by looking at the insight statements that you’ve created. Try rephrasing them as questions by adding “How might we” at the beginning. Use the worksheet on p. 177.
02 The goal is to find opportunities for design, so if your insights suggest several How Might We questions that’s great.
03 Now take a look at your How Might We question and ask yourself if it allows for a variety of solutions. If it doesn’t, broaden it. Your How Might We should generate a number of possible answers and will become a launchpad for your Brainstorms (p. 94).
04 Finally, make sure that your How Might We’s aren’t too broad. It’s a tricky process but a good How Might We should give you both a narrow enough frame to let you know where to start your Brainstorm, but also enough
breadth to give you room to explore wild ideas.</contents>

WHAT YOU’LL NEED Pens, Post-its, paper
PARTICIPANTS Design team
As you Share Inspiring Stories (p. 78), listen for moments when the topic seems to fit into a larger system or feels related to something else you heard.
02 When patterns start to emerge, draw them. At first they can be simple frameworks like Venn diagrams or 2x2 matrices. These simple diagrams can help you map a few forces at work at once.
03 As the systems you hear about become more complex, and you start to think about what you might design, your frameworks will too. For example, a journey map—which charts the steps from first hearing of your product to trying it to recommending it to a friend—might become relevant.
04 Keep refining your frameworks as you move through the Ideation phase and feel free to invent new ones. Your frameworks are bound to change, and that’s OK. Frameworks are only meant to help you visualize your
system, not to capture it perfectly the first time out.</contents>

			<contents>Journey Map A journey map, allows you to visualize a process beginning to end. This simple framework will help you to more easily imagine the entire flow of an experience, whether it’s how a service may work or all the touchpoints of a customer’s journey with a product. This doesn’t need to be an in-depth, detailed representation, but rather a quick-anddirty way of thinking out how a process unfolds.
Relational Map A relational map is used to see how different ideas relate to one another. This type of framework can organize some of what you’ve learned during the Inspiration phase, visualize how things connect, and help you to find patterns. You might start by putting one idea at the center and then mapping how your other ideas and insights play off of it.
2x2 A 2x2 gives you a way to plot your ideas along two separate axes and then home in on insights and themes. By sorting information in this way, you’ll uncover patterns that allow you to draw broader inferences. For instance, you might sort things based on different behavioral, societal, or environmental classifications, using each end of the axis as the extreme. If you were looking into behavioral characteristics associated with the use of adopting a new technology, the x-axis might read risk-taking versus risk-averse, while the y-axis
could be digital versus analog.</contents>

			<contents>Defer judgement. You never know where a good idea is going to come from. The key is to make everyone feel like they can say the idea on their mind and allow others to build on it.
02 Encourage wild ideas. Wild ideas can often give rise to creative leaps. When devising ideas that are wacky or out there, we tend to imagine what we want without the constraints of technology or materials.
03 Build on the ideas of others. Being positive and building on the ideas of others take some skill. In conversation, we try to use “ yes, and...” instead of “but.”
04 Stay focused on the topic. Try to keep the discussion on target, otherwise you may diverge beyond the scope of what you’re trying to design for.
05 One conversation at a time. Your team is far more likely to build on an idea and make a creative leap if everyone is paying full attention.
06 Be visual. In Brainstorms we put our ideas on Post-its and then put them on a wall. Nothing gets an idea across faster than a sketch.
07 Go for quantity. Aim for as many new ideas as possible. In a good session, up to 100 ideas are generated in 60 minutes. Crank the ideas out
quickly and build on the best ones.</contents>

You’ve got lots of drawings and ideas up on the wall, so now it’s time to start moving them around and forming them into more complex solutions.
02 Start by clustering similar ideas into groups. Talk about the best elements of those clusters and combine them with other clusters.
03 Now, start building groupings out of the themes and patterns you’ve found. Focus on translating what you’ve heard into practice, rather than just identifying similar ideas.
04 Once you’ve got a few idea groupings, ask yourself how the best elements of your thinking might live in a system. Now you’re moving from individual
ideas to full-on solutions!</contents>

			<contents>STEPS 01
This is more of a general approach than a one-off activity, so always keep Post-its, paper, and pens handy in case the urge strikes to draw, graph, chart, or make.
02 Drawings may need a bit of additional explanation, so take time to talk through your visuals with the team.
03 If you’re having trouble explaining an idea, consider drawing it. You’ll be
surprised at how quickly it comes into focus.</contents>

			<contents>STEPS 01
The first, and hardest, part of Mash-Ups is to isolate the quality that you’re looking to add to your solution. Is it efficiency, speed, cleanliness, glamour? Write it down on a Post-it and put it on the wall.
02 Now that you’ve got the quality you’re after, Brainstorm (p. 94) real-world examples of businesses, brands, and services that embody that quality.
03 Now, layer that brand on top of your challenge and ask your Mash-Up question.
04 Take your Mash-Up question and Brainstorm what it would look like in the context in which you’re designing. Capture all your ideas on Post-its and
put them up on the wall.</contents>

			<contents>STEPS 01
Look at your most important Post-its and what you came to in Finding Themes (p. 80) in particular.
02 Consider the core principles underpinning those themes. Frame these as positive statements that might tell you how and what to design. Remember, Design Principles operate as a group, and it’s likely that you’ll need to identify several.
03 Look at the Design Principles you’ve come up with. Are they short and to the point? Do they describe just one idea? Try to avoid overly complicating them. If it feels like there are multiple ideas going on, break them into smaller parts.
04 Review your Design Principles and make sure they cover the key aspects of your solution. Modify any that don’t.
05 Be ready to revise your Design Principles as you start to build prototypes and test your ideas. Some Design Principles won’t reveal themselves until you’ve actually designed and tested something, but once you spot them
they’ll become essential.</contents>

			<contents>STEPS 01
Take the ideas that you bundled and put them up on the wall on Post-its.
02 Now might be a good time to Create Frameworks (p. 89) out of those bundled ideas. Start to visualize where your bundles are pointing, but think especially hard about making them into a system.
03 Don’t worry too much about all the details of your solution now—you don’t need a finely tuned Funding Strategy (p. 145) just yet. The goal is to get a robust, flexible concept that addresses the problem you’re trying to solve.
04 Keep referring back to your design challenge. Are you answering it? Are there elements missing in your solution? What else can you incorporate to come up with a great solution?
05 Like the rest of human-centered design, there’s a bit of trial and error here. And creating a concept means you’ll probably create a couple that
don’t work out. That’s fine.</contents>

			<contents>STEPS 01
The first step is to identify who you want in your Co-Creation Session. Perhaps it’s a handful of people you’ve already interviewed. Maybe it’s a particular demographic like teens or female farmers or people without jobs.
02 Once you know who you want, arrange a space, get the necessary supplies (often pens, Post-its, paper, art supplies), and invite them to join.
03 Maximize a Co-Creation Session with Conversation Starters (p. 45), a Brainstorm (p. 94), Role Playing (p. 118), Rapid Prototyping (p. 119), or other activities to get your group engaged.
04 Capture the feedback your group gives you. The goal isn’t just to hear from people, it’s to get them on your team. Make sure that you’re treating
your co-creators as designers, not as Interview (p. 39) subjects.</contents>

WHAT YOU’LL NEED Pens, paper
PARTICIPANTS Design team
01 Have a look at your most promising ideas and try to distill them down to their essences. For example, if your idea is about redesigning the patient experience in a health clinic, the core idea might be achieving more patient privacy.
02 Now, list all the constraints and barriers that stand in your way. Put them on Post-its and display them for everyone to see. Don’t feel daunted if the list is long. Constraints make for great design!
03 This might be a great time to have a quick Brainstorm (p. 94) about how to evolve your idea within the constraints you just listed. How can you keep the core of your idea but push it so that it remains within your capabilities?
04 Don’t be afraid of letting an idea go. The Gut Check is here to help you
make the most promising ideas real.</contents>

WHAT YOU’LL NEED Pens, Post-its, paper
PARTICIPANTS Design team
01 With your team, write down the key elements of your idea. Think practically about what needs to be tested and write down your primary questions for each component.
02 Now pick a few questions to answer. If you want to prototype an interaction, consider putting on a skit with your team. If you’re testing a logo, print it out and stick it on a t-shirt to solicit feedback.
03 Think through what kind of prototype makes the most sense to answer these questions. You might consider holding a Brainstorm (p. 94) now.
04 Remember, this process is about learning, not getting it right the first time. Better to test a miserable failure and learn from it, rather than take
ages making a beautiful, highly refined prototype.</contents>

WHAT YOU’LL NEED Pens, Storyboard worksheets p. 178
PARTICIPANTS Design team
Determine what part of your idea you want to Storyboard. You don’t have to Storyboard the entire thing, and you may find it useful to test a component of your idea like an interaction, or how a customer finds out about your product.
02 Spend no more than 30-45 minutes drawing how your ideas work. Use the series of comic book-style frames on p. 178 or make your own. This will help you spotlight key moments and build a short narrative.
03 Don’t get hung up on your drawing abilities. It’s more important that a Storyboard helps you fully think through your concept than create something that looks beautiful.
04 Once you’re done, act out the Storyboard to your team for feedback.</contents>

WHAT YOU’LL NEED Costumes help, but aren’t entirely necessary
PARTICIPANTS Design team, people you’re designing for
The main goal of prototyping is to make an idea just tangible enough to elicit a response, whether from you, your team, a partner, or whomever you’re designing for.
02 Decide which of your ideas you want to Role Play and assign the necessary roles to your team members.
03 Take about 30 minutes to determine the necessary roles, who will play them, and what it is that you’re looking to test—is it a type of interaction, whether a person will respond to a type of product, the effectiveness of a sales pitch?
04 Costumes and props can be highly effective tools in bringing your Role Play to life. Don’t spend ages on them, but consider making your prototype that much more realistic. You’d be surprised how far just a few
details can go toward making a Role Play feel real.</contents>

01 Once you’ve Determined What to Prototype (p. 111), it’s time to build it. 02 You can make any number of prototypes: Storyboards (p. 113), Role Playing (p. 118), models, mock-ups. The goal here it to make something tangible that conveys the idea you want to test. No need to make it perfect, just make it good enough to get the idea across.
03 Now take your prototype out and test it with people you’re designing for. Put it in their hands and ask them what they make of it. Make sure to Get Feedback (p. 126).
04 Here is where you can Integrate Feedback and Iterate (p. 127). Once you’ve quickly built another prototype you’ll do it all over again until it’s
just right.</contents>

			<contents>STEPS 01
Print out a Business Model Canvas for each of your team members. There’s a good one in the Resources section on p. 180.
02 Sit down with your team and start to fill out the sections of the Business Model Canvas. When you fill it out the first time, expect for there to be holes. It’s okay not to know exactly how everything will work.
03 You may need to pause filling out the sheet to get more information.
04 When you’re done, post the Business Model Canvas in your workspace. Like everything else in the human-centered design process, you’ll refine
it. Consider doing a new one as your project progresses.</contents>

WHAT YOU’LL NEED Pens, paper, your prototype
PARTICIPANTS Design team, people you’re designing for
01 Now that you’ve got a prototype to share, get it in front of the people you’re designing for. There are lots of ways to do it: Reconvene a Group Interview (p. 42), intercept people in markets for Interviews (p. 39), do another Expert Interview (p. 43) with your prototype, or perhaps run a Co-Creation Session (p. 109) designed to elicit feedback.
02 Capturing honest feedback is crucial. People may praise your prototype to be nice, so assure them that this is only a tool by which to learn and that you welcome honest, even negative feedback.
03 Share with lots of people so that you get a variety of reactions. Refer back to Extremes and Mainstreams (p. 49) to make sure you’re capturing a cross-section of potential users.
04 Write down the feedback you hear and use this opportunity with the people you’re designing for to ask more questions and push your
ideas further.</contents>

			<contents>STEPS 01
Sit with your design team and share the feedback that you collected. Use the Share Inspiring Stories (p. 78) or Download Your Learnings (p. 77) Methods to share what you learned.
02 You’ll now probably want to synthesize some of the feedback you got. You can Create Frameworks (p. 89) based on what you heard and how it applies to your idea. You might also now try a Brainstorm (p. 94) around how your idea could change based on your feedback.
03 Get tangible and start building the next iteration of your prototype. Integrating Feedback and Iterating is closely tied to Rapid Prototyping (p. 119). So once you’ve determined how your prototype should change to reflect the feedback you got, build it.
04 Remember that this is a method for refining your idea, not for getting to the ultimate solution the first time. You’ll probably do it a few times to
work out the kinks and get to the right answer.</contents>

			<contents>STEPS 01
The first thing to do is to determine what it is you want to test in your Live Prototype. It could be the way that people find out about your solution or how your service will run or how your distribution model works. For example, you could run a business out of a kiosk for a week to test a channel strategy.
02 Once you’ve decided on what you’re testing, sort out the logistics of your Live Prototype. Do you need a physical space, additional staff, uniforms, a permit, or anything else?
03 If you have the capacity, think about running a few Live Prototypes at once. This will allow you to test a variety of ideas quickly, and see how they work together, which may also be important.
04 Never stop iterating. If something went wrong on Day 1, try a new approach on Day 2. Live Prototypes are all about learning quickly, iterating on the fly, and pushing your solution closer and closer to the real thing.
05 As always, capture feedback from the people you’re designing for.</contents>

			<contents>STEPS 01
Assemble your design team as well as all the critical stakeholders and partners responsible for implementing your idea.
02 Print out a big calendar for the next year or 18 months and use it to map out what needs to happen when. Start putting Post-its on the calendar with key dates like Pilot (p. 146) launch, go-to-market date, etc.
03 It’s easy to get lost in all that needs to happen, so think about your calendar in chunks. Figure out what needs to occur in the next month, in three months, in a year. Themes will emerge around the various tracks of work that will need to take place.
04 Think about the major milestones in your project timeline—when you go to market, when you need to start manufacturing, when you launch your website—and get them on the calendar. Use a different colored Post-it for milestones—perhaps even flip them so they look like diamonds instead of squares to stand out.
05 As you add Post-its to the calendar, assign a team member or partner to each track of work. Find someone to own or champion each element of
your project and prepare to hold them accountable to the tasks.</contents>

WHAT YOU’LL NEED Pens, Post-its, Resource Assessment worksheet p. 182
PARTICIPANTS Design team
The main elements of implementation that you’ll want to understand here are the distribution of your solution, the partners you might need, and the capabilities necessary to execute. Your latest Business Model Canvas (p. 123) should have some of these answers.
02 Start to fill out the Resource Assessment worksheet on p. 182. List what you’ve already got and what you’ll need. You may want to have a Brainstorm (p. 94) about what needs to happen for each of the main categories: Distribution, Activities, Capabilities, and Responsibilities. For example, under Distribution, perhaps you’re considering selling through a storefront model and indirectly through wholesale. Fill out a Resource Assessment worksheet for each model to compare.
03 As you look at all your ideas after the Brainstorm, start to group needs based on actors in the room, and then include a category for needs that are out of the scope of the team. You can list these under Still Needed.
04 Look at how you plan to Staff Your Project. Do you need more or less help
after assessing your resources?</contents>

WHAT YOU’LL NEED Pens, Post-its, paper
PARTICIPANTS Design team, key stakeholders, partners
01 Get your design team together with other key stakeholders and partners. Ideally these same people will or already have worked on your Roadmap (p. 136), Funding Strategy, and Sustainable Revenue.
02 Start with a Brainstorm (p. 94) around what your primary partnership needs are. Maybe you need greater access to the press, maybe you need to raise money. Determine what you need.
03 Next, take those key partnership needs and have another Brainstorm around who you know already and who you can reach out to in your greater network.
04 Though you’ll want to remain flexible, you’ll also want to start to set parameters around what you need from your partners. Figure out when you’ll need each one, how much you can reasonably ask of them, and
what kind of deadlines to set around your ask.</contents>

Use the Ways to Grow Framework worksheet on p. 184 or draw one on a large sheet of paper. The vertical axis represents the novelty of your offering and the horizontal axis represents its users. Totally new offerings land above the horizontal axis and existing ones land below. An idea aimed at new users falls to the right of the vertical axis and one that affects existing users falls to the left.
02 Now, plot your solutions on the worksheet. Revolutionary new ideas that will attract new users will fall in the top right quadrant. Incremental ideas that offer small builds on existing services will hit below the horizontal axis.
03 Look at the distribution of solutions from incremental to revolutionary. Are there gaps in your portfolio of solutions? Are parts of the matrix blank and others full? If so, do you want to devise solutions that fill all four quadrants?
04 Lots of organizations say that they’re interested in revolutionary thinking, but often, incremental and evolutionary change can have the greatest chance for big impact. Think hard about what your organization can
realistically achieve and what will benefit your constituents most.</contents>

WHAT YOU’LL NEED Pens, paper
PARTICIPANTS Design team, key partners
01 Now that you’re most of the way through your project, determine who are the most essential members of your team for the Implementation phase. Make a list of the most important skills that are required by team members for successful implementation. Then reorder the list based on highest priority.
02 Take a look at your existing team. If your team has shrunk, do you need to replace anyone? Do you need a special skill at this point, perhaps a business designer, someone with manufacturing expertise, a healthcare expert?
03 Do you need a project manager now that the Inspiration and Ideation phases are over?
04 Are there organizations that you now need to partner with? What about funders? Will you have to get buy-in from managers or officials to implement your idea?
05 Implementation can take a long time, so think down the road about who
you’ll need now and who you’ll need when you get to market.</contents>

			<contents>STEPS 01
Sit down with your design team, key stakeholders, and partners and start with a Brainstorm about how you might fund the launch of your idea.
02 If you need to apply for grants or raise money, determine which relationships you may need to develop to help your chances. Creating a Pitch (p. 149) will be very helpful in raising money.
03 There are lots of ways to raise money outside of traditional channels. Could a crowdfunding platform like Kickstarter or Indiegogo make sense for your idea?
04 If you’re planning to pay for everything by selling a product or service, how many will you need to produce beforehand? If your product or service is free, how does that play into your Funding Strategy?
05 As you plan your Funding Strategy, also look into the near future. When will you need to break even? How do you bridge from your initial strategy to a
long-term Sustainable Revenue plan?</contents>

			<contents>STEPS 01
First you’ll need to sort out all the logistics of your Pilot. Who will you need to hire, should you rent a space, are your distributors and manufacturers lined up, do you need a permit or anything like that?
02 Before you launch your Pilot, strategize how you can differentiate from your competition, how you get customers in the door, or what kind of messaging you need to succeed? You’ll be out in the market and you’ll need to plan for those dynamics.
03 You’ll be iterating less in Pilot because now is the time to truly test your system. You can of course make necessary improvements, but if you change too many variables it may become harder to know what’s working and what isn’t.
04 As you run your Pilot you’ll want to collect information about how your solution is working. Feedback from the people you’re designing for is always crucial, but you’ll also want to have business metrics to assess
your success.</contents>

			<contents>STEPS 01
Start by returning to your original design challenge. Use that as a lens to think about what success looks like.
02 Look at your Roadmap (p. 136) and find key delivery dates and milestones. Hitting those dates might be a good indicator of early success. How can you plan to make sure you stay on target?
03 Imagine what success would look like from different angles. Maybe breaking even by a certain date makes sense from a business perspective. What about success in terms of your organizational operations? What about the perspective of the community you’re looking to serve?
04 Are there any external measures of success that you need to consider? Are funders or partners going to hold you accountable to certain standards? Plan for those as you Define Success.
05 You can refine how you want to Define Success as you undertake the Monitor and Evaluate (p. 153) Method. They’re related and the one will
feed the other.</contents>

			<contents>STEPS 01
Don’t lose sight of the iterative approach that you’ve taken so far. As counterintuitive as it might seem, your solution is never truly finished. Even when you’ve gone to market you can always improve it.
02 Even if your product, service, or experience is in a good place, think about how you’re marketing it, if you have the right talent on staff, if you could deliver your solution more effectively. These are all opportunities to iterate.
03 Rapid Prototyping (p. 119) and Live Prototyping (p. 135) are great
opportunities to iterate on the fly and quickly test your ideas.</contents>

PARTICIPANTS Design team
The first thing you’ll want to articulate is the essence of your product, service, or experience. Offer context, the main thrust of your idea, why it’s different, and any call to action you’re making. Try to succinctly explain it in less than a minute.
02 You’ll want your pitch to be clear and unambiguous, so don’t get bogged down in the details. Sell your idea by sharing how and why it counts.
03 Next you’ll want to get that story into some kind of format. It could be a pamphlet, a website, a book, or a presentation. You may need more than one. You may need a graphic designer, videographer, or writer to help.
04 You’ll likely communicate differently with different audiences. Make sure that as you Create a Pitch you think about telling stories of varying lengths and in varying degrees of detail. What are the short, medium, and long
versions of your pitch?</contents>

WHAT YOU’LL NEED Pens, Post-its, paper, spreadsheet
PARTICIPANTS Design team, key stakeholders, partners
01 Get your design team together with other key stakeholders and partners. Ideally, these same people will have worked on your Funding Strategy and already understand the key elements of your project.
02 Build a simple spreadsheet that shows all of the costs that the solution would incur, from staff to marketing and production.
03 If you’re relying on grants or donations, think critically about how you’ll raise money and how reliable your funding sources are. What kind of relationships might you need to build to ensure your venture?
04 If you’re selling a product, how much of it do you need to sell to hit your revenue goals? How can you keep customers coming back? How much should your product cost? Will you need to introduce new products over time?
05 Finally, as you have all these discussions, think about scaling your project. In five years, will you be operating in more than one location? Will you have multiple products? Is this first offer part of a family of potential goods or services? How can you grow your long-term revenue plans
alongside your solution?</contents>

The first thing you’ll want to determine is why you need to Monitor and Evaluate your work? Is it to demonstrate impact, to get more funding, to improve business practices, to generate more revenue?
02 Be sure to bring key partners and stakeholders into this conversation. They may have been Monitoring and Evaluating your topic area for years and can provide key insight.
03 Assess whether your team is the best suited to Monitor and Evaluate your work. You may need to hire an outside team or consultants to help you.
04 A common method for assessing impact is a randomized controlled trial (RCT). They are highly rigorous, but are also very expensive and can take years. You’ll also be limited in iterating on your solution during an RCT because it may disrupt the test. Dynamic measurement tools (like number of visits or sales numbers) may be more useful for you.
05 Try to find a balance between quantitative and qualitative measurements. A mix of stories and data can be very powerful.
06 Take a prototyping attitude to your measurement. You can always tweak your business model based on the information coming in to maximize

WHAT YOU’LL NEED Pens, Post-its, notebook
PARTICIPANTS Design team, people you’re designing for, key stakeholders, partners
As you move into Live Prototyping and Pilot, make sure that you’re collecting feedback. Interviews (p. 39) and Group Interviews (p. 42) are a great way to learn from the people you’re designing for.
02 Reach out to key partners as well for their input. They’ll often have expertise that the design team may not and can help point the way forward. Convening the right group of stakeholders all at once can bring up a lot of feedback in a single session.
03 Capture feedback in your notebook and share back with the design team. You can do this by Sharing Inspiring Stories (p. 78) and Downloading Your
Learnings (p. 77).</contents>
